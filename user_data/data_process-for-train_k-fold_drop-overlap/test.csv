Gut microbiota-derived metabolite 3-idoleacetic acid together with LPS induces IL-35 + B cell generation,"Background:                    IL-35-producing Bregs and Treg cells critically regulate chronic illnesses worldwide via mechanisms related to disrupting the gut microbiota composition. However, whether the gut microbiota regulates these IL-35+ cells remains elusive. We herein investigated the regulatory effects of the gut microbiota on IL-35+ cells by using genetically modified mouse models of obesity.              Results:                    We first found that gut Reg4 promoted resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity. Using 16S rRNA sequencing combined with LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry)/MS, we demonstrated that gut Reg4 associated with bacteria such as Lactobacillus promoted the generation of IL-35+ B cells through 3-idoleacetic acid (IAA) in the presence of LPS. HuREG4IECtg mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited marked IL-35+ cell accumulation in not only their adipose tissues but also their colons, whereas decreased IL-35+ cell accumulation was observed in the adipose and colon tissues of Reg4 knockout (KO) mice. We also found that Reg4 mediated HFD-induced obesity resistance via IL-35. Lower levels of IAA were also detected in the peripheral blood of individuals with obesity compared with nonobese subjects. Mechanistically, IAA together with LPS mediated IL-35+ B cells through PXR and TLR4. KO of PXR or TLR4 impaired the generation of IL-35+ B cells.              Conclusion:                    Together, IAA and LPS induce the generation of IL-35+ B cells through PXR and TLR4. Video Abstract.",-1
[A spatial localization model of mobile robot based on entorhinal-hippocampal cognitive mechanism in rat brain],"Physiological studies reveal that rats rely on multiple spatial cells for spatial navigation and memory. In this paper, we investigated the firing mechanism of spatial cells within the entorhinal-hippocampal structure of the rat brain and proposed a spatial localization model for mobile robot. Its characteristics were as follows: on the basis of the information transmission model from grid cells to place cells, the neural network model of place cells interaction was introduced to obtain the place cell plate with a single-peaked excitatory activity package. Then the solution to the robot's position was achieved by establishing a transformation relationship between the position of the excitatory activity package on the place cell plate and the robot's position in the physical environment. In this paper, simulation experiments and physical experiments were designed to verify the model. The experimental results showed that compared with RatSLAM and the model of grid cells to place cells, the positioning performance of the model in this paper was more accurate, and the cumulative error in the long-time path integration process of the robot was also smaller. The research results of this paper lay a foundation for the robot navigation method that mimics the cognitive mechanism of rat brain.",-1
A mucin-responsive hybrid two-component system controls Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron colonization and gut homeostasis,"The mammalian intestinal tract contains trillions of bacteria. However, the genetic factors that allow gut symbiotic bacteria to occupy intestinal niches remain poorly understood. Here, we identified genetic determinants required for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron colonization in the gut using transposon sequencing analysis. Transposon insertion in BT2391, which encodes a hybrid two-component system, increased the competitive fitness of B. thetaiotaomicron. The BT2391 mutant showed a growth advantage in a mucin-dependent manner and had an increased ability to adhere to mucus-producing cell lines. The increased competitive advantage of the BT2391 mutant was dependent on the BT2392-2395 locus containing susCD homologs. Deletion of BT2391 led to changes in the expression levels of B. thetaiotaomicron genes during gut colonization. However, colonization of the BT2391 mutant promoted DSS colitis in low-fiber diet-fed mice. These results indicate that BT2391 contributes to a sustainable symbiotic relationship by maintaining a balance between mucosal colonization and gut homeostasis.",-1
Progress in Assays of HMGB1 Levels in Human Plasma-The Potential Prognostic Value in COVID-19,"Extracellular HMGB1 protein is known to induce inflammatory responses leading to an inflammatory storm. The outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome COVID-19 due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a huge health concern worldwide. Recent data revealed that plasma/serum HMGB1 levels of patients suffering from inflammation-mediated disorders-such as COVID-19, cancer, and autoimmune disorders-correlate positively with disease severity and vice versa. A late release of HMGB1 in sepsis suggests the existence of a wide therapeutic window for treating sepsis. Rapid and accurate methods for the detection of HMGB1 levels in plasma/serum are, therefore, of great importance for monitoring the occurrence, treatment success, and survival prediction of patients with inflammation-mediated diseases. In this review, we briefly explain the role of HMGB1 in the cell, and particularly the involvement of extracellular HMGB1 (released from the cells) in inflammation-mediated diseases, with an emphasis on COVID-19. The current assays to measure HMGB1 levels in human plasma-Western blotting, ELISA, EMSA, and a new approach based on electrochemical immunosensors, including some of our preliminary results-are presented and thoroughly discussed.",-1
Microbiota-Meditated Immunity Abnormalities Facilitate Hepatitis B Virus Co-Infection in People Living With HIV: A Review,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection is fairly common in people living with HIV (PLWH) and affects millions of people worldwide. Identical transmission routes and HIV-induced immune suppression have been assumed to be the main factors contributing to this phenomenon. Moreover, convergent evidence has shown that people co-infected with HIV and HBV are more likely to have long-term serious medical problems, suffer more from liver-related diseases, and have higher mortality rates, compared to individuals infected exclusively by either HIV or HBV. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the comorbid infection of HIV and HBV have not been fully elucidated. In recent times, the human gastrointestinal microbiome is progressively being recognized as playing a pivotal role in modulating immune function, and is likely to also contribute significantly to critical processes involving systemic inflammation. Both antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naÃ¯ve HIV-infected subjects and ART-treated individuals are now known to be characterized by having gut microbiomic dysbiosis, which is associated with a damaged intestinal barrier, impaired mucosal immunological functioning, increased microbial translocation, and long-term immune activation. Altered microbiota-related products in PLWH, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), have been associated with the development of leaky gut syndrome, favoring microbial translocation, which in turn has been associated with a chronically activated underlying host immune response and hence the facilitated pathogenesis of HBV infection. Herein, we critically review the interplay among gut microbiota, immunity, and HIV and HBV infection, thus laying down the groundwork with respect to the future development of effective strategies to efficiently restore normally diversified gut microbiota in PLWH with a dysregulated gut microbiome, and thus potentially reduce the prevalence of HBV infection in this population.",-1
Late Onset of ANCA Vasculitis as a Side Effect of Levamisole Treatment in Nephrotic Syndrome,"Levamisole is effectively used in steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome and the more frequent side effects reported are cytopenia and liver enzymes alterations. Several studies have demonstrated that this drug can induce high titers of circulating perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) and vasculitis, most of them occurring in the case of prolonged use. A four-year-old boy that was affected with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome was treated with Levamisole as a steroid-sparing agent at a dose of 2 mg/kg/48 h. After initiation of the treatment, the number of relapses drastically decreased, enabling a significant reduction in the cumulative steroid dose. Levamisole was well tolerated, and was therefore administered for several years. At the age of 15, he was also diagnosed with celiac disease. After nine years of continuous Levamisole treatment, he presented with a high fever, hand and foot joint arthritis, and increased levels of total and direct bilirubin. Since the symptoms started two days after the injection of the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, it was initially concluded that these manifestations were rare vaccination side effects. Therefore, he did not receive any specific treatments, and Levamisole was continued at the same dose. After an initial improvement, two months later, the patient presented with the same symptoms. Suspecting Levamisole-induced vasculitis, an ANCA titer was measured and this returned positive. Clinical manifestations and double positivity for both myeloperoxidase (MPO) and anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies argued against the fact that that these findings were secondary to vaccination, cocaine abuse, or celiac disease. Assuming that we were facing a rare drug reaction, Levamisole was promptly interrupted. This resulted in a rapid remission of fever and arthritis improvement, and a decrease in ANCA titers. By reporting this case, we want to raise awareness among clinicians regarding a rare complication of treatment with Levamisole that is often misdiagnosed due to the fact that the current literature lacks univocal guidelines regarding the precise timing of ANCA titrations and the duration of the treatment.",-1
Research on Open Oral English Scoring System Based on Neural Network,"This study designs and implements a scoring system for open-spoken English using NN technology. The system scores the oral recording from the phonetic level and the text level, respectively, and can comprehensively evaluate its oral level. The system will separately score the spoken speech and the spoken content through different scoring models and add the scoring results as the final score, in which the spoken content is obtained by text transcription of the recording by an external speech recognition engine. An acoustic sensor is adopted to collect pronunciation signals of spoken English. Modern signal processing and automatic pattern recognition technology are used to distinguish the quality of spoken pronunciation. Similar semantic units are marked between acoustic feature sequences, which make use of the parallel algorithm processing mode of multi-computing cores of modern GPU and allow multiple units to independently execute the comparison algorithm at the same time. Experiments show that the model in this study achieves better comprehensive scoring performance. The scoring model is of great significance to the development of educational informatization and intelligence, and it also provides a reference for the construction of intelligent oral scoring system.",-1
Single-cell-resolution map of human retinal pigment epithelium helps discover subpopulations with differential disease sensitivity,"Regional phenotypic and functional differences in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) monolayer have been suggested to account for regional susceptibility in ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), late-onset retinal degeneration (L-ORD), and choroideremia (CHM). However, a comprehensive description of human topographical RPE diversity is not yet available, thus limiting the understanding of regional RPE diversity and degenerative disease sensitivity in the eye. To develop a complete morphometric RPE map of the human eye, artificial intelligenceâbased software was trained to recognize, segment, and analyze RPE borders. Five statistically different, concentric RPE subpopulations (P1 to P5) were identified using cell area as a parameter, including a subpopulation (P4) with cell area comparable to that of macular cells in the far periphery of the eye. This work provides a complete reference map of human RPE subpopulations and their location in the eye. In addition, the analysis of cadaver non-AMD and AMD eyes and ultra-widefield fundus images of patients revealed differential vulnerability of the five RPE subpopulations to different retinal diseases.",-1
Two polyphenol-rich Brazilian fruit extracts protect from diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis in mice,"Consumption of polyphenol-rich food is associated with better metabolic health. Tucum-do-Pantanal (Bactris setosa Mart) and taruma-do-cerrado (Vitex cymosa Bertero ex Spreng) are underexploited native Brazilian fruits with an important source of phytochemicals. In this study, we assessed the effects of 100 mg kg-1 tucum (TPE) and taruma (TCE) extracts on diet-induced obesity (DIO) C57BL/6J mice. After 8 weeks of daily treatment, TPE and TCE were found to significantly prevented the diet-induced body weight gain and fully protected against hepatic steatosis associated with a tendency to stimulate hepatic AMPK phosphorylation. TPE reduced visceral obesity and improved glucose metabolism as revealed by an improvement of the insulin tolerance test, a reduction in the insulin fasting level, and a decreased glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia during an oral glucose tolerance test. TPE and TCE showed promising effects on the treatment of obesity and NAFLD, furthermore, TPE on insulin resistance.",-1
Macrophage control of Crohn's disease,"The intestinal tract is the body's largest mucosal surface and permanently exposed to microbial and environmental signals. Maintaining a healthy intestine requires the presence of sentinel grounds keeper cells, capable of controlling immunity and tissue homeostasis through specialized functions. Intestinal macrophages are such cells and important players in steady-state functions and during acute and chronic inflammation. Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestinal tract is proposed to be the consequence of an altered immune system through microbial and environmental stimulation. This hypothesis suggests an involvement of macrophages in the regulation of this pathology. Within this chapter, we will discuss intestinal macrophage development and highlight data suggesting their implication in chronic intestinal pathologies like Crohn's disease.",-1
Autophagy-driven neutrophil extracellular traps: The dawn of sepsis,"Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory syndrome caused by infection disorders. The core mechanism of sepsis is immune dysfunction. Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating white blood cells, which play a crucial role in mediating the innate immune response. Previous studies have shown that an effective way to treat sepsis is through the regulation of neutrophil functions. Autophagy, a highly conserved degradation process, is responsible for removing denatured proteins or damaged organelles within cells and protecting cells from external stimuli. It is a key homeostasis process that promotes neutrophil function and differentiation. Autophagy has been shown to be closely associated with inflammation and immunity. Neutrophils, the first line of innate immunity, migrate to inflammatory sites upon their activation. Neutrophil-mediated autophagy may participate in the clinical course of sepsis. In this review, we summarized and analyzed the latest research findings on the changes in neutrophil external traps during sepsis, the regulatory role of autophagy in neutrophil, and the potential application of autophagy-driven NETs in sepsis, so as to guide clinical treatment of sepsis.",-1
Direct and indirect pathways from maternal and paternal empathy to young children's socioemotional functioning,"In the present article, we investigated the contributions of maternal and paternal empathy to child socioemotional competence both directly and indirectly through parents' emotion socialization practices using data from two longitudinal studies: Study 1 (n = 122, 61 girls, M age = 33 months) and Study 2 (n = 60, 31 girls; M age = 27 months). Results indicated that parental empathy had an indirect effect on children's positive peer relations (Study 1 and Study 2) via more supportive reactions to children's negative emotions. No indirect effects of parental empathy emerged in the models examining parents' nonsupportive reactions to children's emotions, although parental empathy showed a direct association with greater child empathy (Study 2). Moreover, paths composing indirect and direct effects did not significantly differ as a function of parent gender. The findings suggest that mothers' and fathers' dispositional empathy contribute in similar ways to young children's socioemotional competence.

"Testing configurations of attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB) stations in Mali, West Africa, for improving the control of malaria parasite transmission by vector mosquitoes and minimizing their effect on non-target insects","Background:                    Application methods of |Attractive Toxic Sugar Baits (ATSB) need to be improved for wide-scale use, and effects on non-target organisms (NTOs) must be assessed. The goals of this study were to determine, at the village level, the effect of different configurations of bait stations to (1) achieve < 25% Anopheles mosquito vector daily feeding rate for both males and females and (2) minimize the effect on non-target organisms.              Methods:                    Dye was added to Attractive Sugar Bait Stations (without toxin) to mark mosquitoes feeding on the baits, and CDC UV light traps were used to monitor for marked mosquitoes. An array of different traps were used to catch dye marked NTOs, indicating feeding on the ASB. Stations were hung on homes (1, 2, or 3 per home to optimize density) at different heights (1.0 m or 1.8 m above the ground). Eight villages were chosen as for the experiments.              Results:                    The use of one ASB station per house did not mark enough mosquitoes. Use of two and three stations per house gave feeding rates above the 25% goal. There was no statistical difference in the percentage of marked mosquitoes between two and three stations, however, the catches using two and three bait stations were both significantly higher than using one. There was no difference in An. gambiae s.l. feeding when stations were hung at 1.0 and 1.8 m. At 1.8 m stations sustained less accidental damage. ASB stations 1.8 m above ground were fed on by three of seven monitored insect orders. The monitored orders were: Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Neuroptera and Orthoptera. Using one or two stations significantly reduced percentage of bait-fed NTOs compared to three stations which had the highest feeding rates. Percentages were as follows: 6.84 Â± 2.03% Brachycera followed by wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) 5.32 Â± 2.27%, and Rhopalocera 2.22 Â± 1.79%. Hanging the optimal number of stations per house for catching mosquitoes (two) at 1.8 m above ground, limited the groups of non-targets to Brachycera, Chironomidae, Noctuoidea, Rhopalocera, parasitic wasps and wasps (Hymenoptera). Feeding at 1.8 m only occurred when stations were damaged.              Conclusions:                    The goal of marking quarter of the total Anopheles population per day was obtained using 2 bait stations at 1.8 m height above the ground. This configuration also had minimal effects on non-target insects.",-1
Thigh and abdominal adipose tissue depot associations with testosterone levels in postmenopausal females,"Objective:                    Research findings on the relationship between serum androgens and adipose tissue in older females are inconsistent. We aimed to clarify the relationship using state-of-the-art techniques to evaluate associations between body fat distribution and plasma testosterone (T) levels in older postmenopausal women.              Design:                    Observational, cross-sectional study of healthy, community dwelling postmenopausal women.              Patients and measurements:                    Postmenopausal women (60-80 years old) were included in this study. Overall body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Abdominal and thigh fat depots were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Circulating T concentrations were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.              Results:                    Thirty-five women (66.6 Â± 0.8 years) participated in this study. T levels were positively associated with clinical proxy measures of adiposity including weight (Ï = 0.39), BMI (Ï = 0.43) and waist circumference (Ï = 0.39) (all P < 0.05). Fat mass and % body fat were correlated with T levels (Ï = 0.42 and 0.38 respectively, both P < 0.05). T correlated with overall and superficial abdominal fat (Ï = 0.34 and 0.37 respectively, both P < 0.05) but not with visceral adipose tissue. T increased with greater thigh fat (Ï = 0.49, P < 0.05) in both superficial and deep depots (Ï = 0.50 and 0.35 respectively, both P < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    Our results suggest that postmenopausal women with higher circulating T levels have both higher regional and overall body adiposity. These findings underscore the sexual dimorphism in the relationship between serum androgen levels and adiposity.",-1
[Polysaccharide of Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma inhibits expression of immune checkpoint PD-L1 by targeting miR-34a in esophageal carcinoma cells],"The immune checkpoint programmed cell death-ligand 1(PD-L1)-mediated immunosuppression is among the important features of tumor. PD-L1, an immunosuppressant, can induce T cell failure by binding to programmed cell death-1(PD-1). Thus, the key to restoring the function of T cells is inhibiting the expression of PD-L1. The Chinese medicinal Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma(AMR) has the anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic activities, and the polysaccharide in AMR(PAMR) plays a crucial role in immunoregulation, but the influence on the immune checkpoints which are closely related to immunosuppression has not been reported. MicroRNA-34 a(miR-34 a) expression in esophageal carcinoma tissue is significantly lower than that in normal tissue. This study aims to investigate the inhibitory effect of PAMR on esophageal carcinoma cells, and the relationship between its inhibitory effect on PD-L1 expression and miR-34 a, which is expected to clarify the anti-tumor mechanism of PAMR. Firstly, different human esophageal carcinoma cell lines(EC9706, EC-1, TE-1, EC109 cells) were screend out, and expression of PD-L1 was determined. Then, EC109 cells, with high expression of PD-L1, were selected for further experiment. The result showed that PAMR suppressed EC109 cell growth. According to the real-time quantitative PCR(qPCR) and Western blot, it significantly suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of PD-L1, while promoting the expression of tumor suppressor miR-34 a. The confocal microscopy and luci-ferase assay proved that PAMR alleviated the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 while blocked miR-34 a. Additionally, the expression of PD-L1 was controlled by miR-34 a, and the combination of miR-34 a inhibitor with high-dose PAMR reversed the inhibitory effect of PAMR on PD-L1 protein expression. Thus, the PAMR may inhibit PD-L1 by increasing the expression of miR-34 a and regulating its downstream target genes. In conclusion, PAMR inhibits the expression of PD-L1 mainly by inducing miR-34 a.",-1
Restoration of miR-23a expression by chidamide sensitizes CML cells to imatinib treatment with concomitant downregulation of CRYAB,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various processes from the initiation and development of cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this report, we aimed to investigate the roles of miR-23a in the regulation of imatinib mesylate (IM) sensitivity in CML cells and the possible mechanisms involved in this process. We demonstrated that the expression of miR-23a was markedly low in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients in whom IM treatment had failed and imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cells when compared to patients with optimal responses and imatinib-sensitive K562 cells, respectively. Overexpression of miR-23a was shown to induce apoptosis of K562/G01 cells and sensitize these cells to imatinib treatment. With the aid of bioinformatics analysis, we revealed that CRYAB could be a potential downstream effector of miR-23a, contributing to miR-23a-mediated IM resistance. We also observed that the expression of CRYAB was inversely correlated with miR-23a expression in CML cell lines and patient samples. Importantly, chidamide upregulated miR-23a expression and reversed the IM resistance of CML cells. Together, these findings strongly suggest that miR-23a acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating CRYAB expression. Restoration of miR-23a by chidamide may therefore have a therapeutic effect in controlling the sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib.",-1
"Anopheles ecology, genetics and malaria transmission in northern Cambodia","In the Greater Mekong Subregion, malaria cases have significantly decreased but little is known about the vectors or mechanisms responsible for residual malaria transmission. We analysed a total of 3920 Anopheles mosquitoes collected during the rainy and dry seasons from four ecological settings in Cambodia (villages, forested areas near villages, rubber tree plantations and forest sites). Using odor-baited traps, 81% of the total samples across all sites were collected in cow baited traps, although 67% of the samples attracted by human baited traps were collected in forest sites. Overall, 20% of collected Anopheles were active during the day, with increased day biting during the dry season. 3131 samples were identified morphologically as 14 different species, and a subset was also identified by DNA amplicon sequencing allowing determination of 29 Anopheles species. The investigation of well characterized insecticide mutations (ace-1, kdr, and rdl genes) indicated that individuals carried mutations associated with response to all the different classes of insecticides. There also appeared to be a non-random association between mosquito species and insecticide resistance with Anopheles peditaeniatus exhibiting nearly fixed mutations. Molecular screening for Plasmodium sp. presence indicated that 3.6% of collected Anopheles were positive, most for P. vivax followed by P. falciparum. These results highlight some of the key mechanisms driving residual human malaria transmission in Cambodia, and illustrate the importance of diverse collection methods, sites and seasons to avoid bias and better characterize Anopheles mosquito ecology in Southeast Asia.",-1
Predictors of Clinical Inertia and Type 2 Diabetes: Assessment of Primary Care Physicians and Their Patients,"With the growing prevalence and complex pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, many patients fail to achieve treatment goals despite guidelines and possibilities for treatment individualization. One of the identified root causes of this failure is clinical inertia. We explored this phenomenon, its possible predictors, and groups of patients affected the most, together with offering potential paths for intervention. Our research was a cross-sectional study conducted during 2021 involving 52 physicians and 543 patients of primary healthcare institutions in Belgrade, Serbia. The research instruments were questionnaires based on similar studies, used to collect information related to the factors that contribute to developing clinical inertia originating in both physicians and patients. In 224 patients (41.3%), clinical inertia was identified in patients with poor overall health condition, long diabetes duration, and comorbidities. Studying the changes made to the treatment, most patients (53%) had their treatment adjustment more than a year ago, with 19.3% of patients changing over the previous six months. Moreover, we found significant inertia in the treatment of patients using modern insulin analogues. Referral to secondary healthcare institutions reduced the emergence of inertia. This assessment of primary care physicians and their patients pointed to the high presence of clinical inertia, with an overall health condition, comorbidities, diabetes duration, current treatment, last treatment change, glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting glucose measuring frequency, BMI, patient referral, diet adjustment, and physician education being significant predictors.",-1
The Functions of PCNA in Tumor Stemness and Invasion,"Invasion is the most prominent lethal feature of malignant cancer. However, how cell proliferation, another important feature of tumor development, is integrated with tumor invasion and the subsequent cell dissemination from primary tumors is not well understood. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is essential for DNA replication in cancer cells. Loss of phosphorylation at tyrosine 211 (Y211) in PCNA (pY211-PCNA) mitigates PCNA function in proliferation, triggers replication fork arrest/collapse, which in turn sets off an anti-tumor inflammatory response, and suppresses distant metastasis. Here, we show that pY211-PCNA is important in stromal activation in tumor tissues. Loss of the phosphorylation resulted in reduced expression of mesenchymal proteins as well as tumor progenitor markers, and of the ability of invasion. Spontaneous mammary tumors that developed in mice lacking Y211 phosphorylation contained fewer tumor-initiating cells compared to tumors in wild-type mice. Our study demonstrates a novel function of PCNA as an essential factor for maintaining cancer stemness through Y211 phosphorylation.",-1
Exercise training promotes a GDF15-associated reduction in fat mass in older adults with obesity,"Obesity is a major risk factor for metabolic disease. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has shown promise as a weight loss agent for obesity in animal studies. In healthy lean humans, fasting plasma GDF15 increases after acute exercise. However, the role of GDF15 in human obesity and the response of plasma GDF15 to exercise training in patients with obesity is unknown. Here, 24 sedentary volunteers with obesity [age: 65 Â± 1 yr; body mass index (BMI): 35.3 Â± 0.9 kg/m2] participated in a supervised 12-wk aerobic exercise intervention: 1 h/day, 5 days/wk at ~85% maximum heart rate with controlled isocaloric diet. As a result, plasma GDF15 was significantly increased (PRE: 644.1 Â± 42.6 pg/ml, POST: 704.4 Â± 47.2 pg/ml, P < 0.01) after the exercise intervention. Inconsistent with animal models, ÎGDF15 was not correlated with change in weight, BMI, or resting energy expenditure. However, ÎGDF15 was correlated with a reduction in total fat mass (P < 0.05), abdominal fat mass (P < 0.05), and android fat mass (P â?0.05). Participants with a positive GDF15 response to exercise had increased total fat oxidation (PRE: 0.25 Â± 0.05 mgÂ·kg-1Â·min-1, POST: 0.43 Â± 0.07 mgÂ·kg-1Â·min-1, P â?0.05), metabolic flexibility [PRE: -0.01 Â± 0.01 delta respiratory quotient (RQ), POST: 0.06 Â± 0.01 delta RQ, P < 0.001], and insulin sensitivity (PRE: 0.33 Â± 0.01 QUICKI index, POST: 0.34 Â± 0.01 QUICKI index, P < 0.01), suggesting a link between GDF15 and fat mass loss as well as exercise-induced metabolic improvement in humans with obesity. We conclude that the exercise-induced increase in plasma GDF15 and the association with reduced fat mass may indicate a role for GDF15 as a therapeutic target for human obesity.",-1
Relationship Between the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate and Visceral Fat Thickness Based on Ultrasound in Patients With Obesity Who Have Normal Renal Function Without Hypertension or Diabetes,"Objectives:                    To investigate the relationship between visceral fat thickness measured by US and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with obesity who did not have hypertension or diabetes and who had normal renal function.              Methods:                    Inclusion criteria included an estimated GFR of greater than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 , blood pressure lower than 120/80 mm Hg, and a fasting blood glucose level of less than 126 mg/dL. Patients were divided into groups with (body mass index â?8 kg/m2 ) and without (body mass index <28 kg/m2 ) obesity. Subcutaneous and visceral fat thicknesses were measured with ultrasound.              Results:                    A total of 95 patients were enrolled with an age range of 25 to 58 years. The patients were divided into groups with (n = 48) and without obesity (n = 47); patients with obesity were further divided into subcutaneous obesity (n = 23) and visceral obesity (n = 25) groups. The estimated GFR in the group with obesity was significantly lower than that in the group without obesity (P = .037), and the estimated GFR in the group with visceral obesity was significantly lower than that in the group with subcutaneous obesity (P = .006). Moreover, the estimated GFR was negatively correlated with visceral fat thickness (V1:r = -0.750;P7 < 0.001;V2:r = -0.824;P < 0.001) but not correlated with subcutaneous fat thickness.              Conclusions:                    Ultrasound is an easy and accurate practical evaluation modality for measuring the thickness of fat. There was an inverse relationship between the estimated GFR and visceral fat thickness in patients with obesity who did not have hypertension or diabetes and who had normal renal function. This result suggests that as visceral fat increases, the estimated GFR may be reduced accordingly.",-1
Effects of dietary restriction on gut microbiota and CNS autoimmunity,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease. It is due to the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Current opinion is that diet could play a pathogenic role in disease onset and development. Dietary restriction (DR) without malnutrition markedly improves health and increases lifespan in multiple model organisms. DR regimens that utilize continuous or intermittent food restriction can induce anti-inflammatory, immuno-modulatory and neuroendocrine adaptations promoting health. These adaptations exert neuroprotective effects in the main MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This review summarizes the current knowledge on DR-induced changes in gut microbial composition and metabolite production and its impact on underlying functional mechanisms. Studies demonstrating the protective effects of DR regimens on EAE and people with MS are also presented.

Immunostimulatory effects of vitamin B5 improve anticancer immunotherapy,"Vitamin B5 (panthotenic acid), the precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), is contained in most food items and is produced by the intestinal microbiota. A recent study published in Cell Metabolism reports that vitamin B5 and CoA favor the differentiation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells into interleukin-22 (IL-22)-producing Tc22 cells, likely through fueling mitochondrial metabolism. Importantly, in a small cohort of melanoma patients, the plasma levels of vitamin B5 positively correlate with responses to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy. Moreover, in mice, supplementation with vitamin B5 increases the efficacy of PD-L1-targeted cancer immunotherapy, and in vitro culture of T cells with CoA enhances their antitumor activity upon adoptive transfer into mice. These finding suggest that vitamin B5 is yet another B vitamin that stimulates anti-cancer immunosurveillance.",-1
Peptide vaccine for semaphorin3E ameliorates systemic glucose intolerance in mice with dietary obesity,"We previously demonstrated that cellular aging signals upregulated a secreted class 3 semaphorin E (Sema3E) and its receptor plexinD1 in the adipose tissue of a murine model of dietary obesity and that Sema3E was a chemoattractant, mediating its biological effects by inducing infiltration of plexinD1-positive inflammatory macrophages into the visceral white adipose tissue. This study was performed to develop a peptide vaccine for Sema3E and test its therapeutic potential in a murine model of dietary obesity. Two antigenic peptides were selected to generate neutralizing antibodies for a vaccine. These peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and were administered with Freund's adjuvant to obese wild-type male mice. The Sema3E antibody titer was analyzed by ELISA, and the biological effects of the peptides were tested in mice with dietary obesity. Among the two candidate peptides, the Sema3E antibody titer was significantly increased by injection of KLH-conjugated HKEGPEYHWS (Sema3E vaccine). Administration of Sema3E vaccine suppressed the infiltration of plexinD1-positive cells, ameliorated chronic inflammation in visceral white adipose tissue, and improved systemic glucose intolerance in mice with dietary obesity, suggesting that Sema3E vaccine has the potential to become a next generation therapy for obesity and diabetes.",-1
"Outcomes and treatment responses, including work productivity, among people with axial spondyloarthritis living in urban and rural areas: a mixed-methods study within a national register","Objective:                    To examine differences in clinical and patient-reported outcomes, including work, in individuals with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) living in rural and urban settings.              Methods:                    Using a sequential, explanatory mixed-method design, data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Ankylosing Spondylitis were used to (1) characterise participants with axSpA living in rural and urban areas and (b) assess any differences in outcome after commencement of biologic therapy (phase 1). Semistructured interviews (phase 2) further explored the results from phase 1.              Results:                    Patients with axSpA living in rural areas were older and more likely to work in a physical job. Among patients prescribed biologics, there were no differences in response to biologics, but after adjustment for age, sex and local area deprivation rural dwellers reported more presenteeism and overall work impairment. Work effects could be explained by accounting for individual differences in disease activity, fatigue, physical function and job type. Interviews highlighted the complex relationship between clinical factors, contextual factors (work environment, job demands) and work disability. The ability to work and flexibility in terms of what, when and how tasks are undertaken were important. Support from employers was variable and healthcare professionals were often perceived as unsupportive.              Conclusions:                    Patients with axSpA living in rural areas report a greater impact of their disease on work productivity. New measures are needed to capture important contextual factors and comprehensively determine the impact of long-term conditions on work. Future European League Against Rheumatism axSpA recommendations should include support to work as a target to optimise quality of life in patients with axSpA.",-1
Microglial FABP4-UCP2 Axis Modulates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Decline in Obese Mice,"The microglial fatty-acid-binding protein 4-uncoupling protein 2 (FABP4-UCP2) axis is a key regulator of neuroinflammation in high-fat-diet (HFD)-fed animals, indicating a role for FABP4 in brain immune response. We hypothesized that the FABP4-UCP2 axis is involved in regulating diet-induced cognitive decline. We tested cognitive function in mice lacking microglial FABP4 (AKO mice). Fifteen-week-old male AKO and wild-type (WT) mice were maintained on 60% HFD or normal chow (NC) for 12 weeks. Body composition was measured using EchoMRI. Locomotor activity, working memory, and spatial memory were assessed using behavioral tests (open field, T-maze, and Barnes maze, respectively). Hippocampal microgliosis was assessed via immunohistochemical staining. An inflammatory cytokine panel was assayed using hippocampal tissue. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to measure microglial UCP2 mRNA expression. Our data support that loss of FABP4 prevents cognitive decline in vivo. HFD-fed WT mice exhibited impaired long- and short-term memory, in contrast with HFD-fed AKO mice. HFD-fed WT mice had an increase in hippocampal inflammatory cytokine expression (IFNÎ³, IL-1Î², IL-5, IL-6, KC/GRO(CXCL1), IL-10, and TNFÎ±) and microgliosis, and decreased microglial UCP2 expression. HFD-fed AKO mice had decreased hippocampal inflammatory cytokine expression and microgliosis and increased microglial UCP2 expression compared to HFD-fed WT mice. Collectively, our work supports the idea that the FABP4-UCP2 axis represents a potential therapeutic target in preventing diet-induced cognitive decline.",-1
Insect-Specific Flavivirus Replication in Mammalian Cells Is Inhibited by Physiological Temperature and the Zinc-Finger Antiviral Protein,"The genus Flavivirus contains pathogenic vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses (VIFs) and insect-specific flaviviruses (ISF). ISF transmission to vertebrates is inhibited at multiple stages of the cellular infection cycle, via yet to be elucidated specific antiviral responses. The zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) in vertebrate cells can bind CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA, limiting virus replication. Interestingly, the genomes of ISFs contain more CpG dinucleotides compared to VIFs. In this study, we investigated whether ZAP prevents two recently discovered lineage II ISFs, Binjari (BinJV) and Hidden Valley viruses (HVV) from replicating in vertebrate cells. BinJV protein and dsRNA replication intermediates were readily observed in human ZAP knockout cells when cultured at 34 Â°C. In ZAP-expressing cells, inhibition of the interferon response via interferon response factors 3/7 did not improve BinJV protein expression, whereas treatment with kinase inhibitor C16, known to reduce ZAP's antiviral function, did. Importantly, at 34 Â°C, both BinJV and HVV successfully completed the infection cycle in human ZAP knockout cells evident from infectious progeny virus in the cell culture supernatant. Therefore, we identify vertebrate ZAP as an important barrier that protects vertebrate cells from ISF infection. This provides new insights into flavivirus evolution and the mechanisms associated with host switching.",-1
Aedes aegypti Shows Increased Susceptibility to Zika Virus via Both In Vitro and In Vivo Models of Type II Diabetes,"Chronic conditions like type II diabetes (T2DM) have long been known to exacerbate many infectious diseases. For many arboviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), severe outcomes, morbidity and mortality usually only occur in patients with such pre-existing conditions. However, the effects of T2DM and other pre-existing conditions on human blood (e.g., hypo/hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia) that may impact infectivity of arboviruses for vectors is largely unexplored. We investigated whether the susceptibility of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes was affected when the mosquitoes fed on ""diabetic"" bloodmeals, such as bloodmeals composed of artificially glycosylated erythrocytes or those from viremic, diabetic mice (LEPRDB/DB). Increasing glycosylation of erythrocytes from hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) values of 5.5-5.9 to 6.2 increased the infection rate of a Galveston, Texas strain of Ae. aegypti to ZIKV strain PRVABC59 at a bloodmeal titer of 4.14 log10 FFU/mL from 0.0 to 40.9 and 42.9%, respectively. ZIKV was present in the blood of viremic LEPRDB/DB mice at similar levels as isogenic control C57BL/6J mice (3.3 log10 FFU/mL and 3.6 log10 FFU/mL, respectively. When mice sustained a higher ZIKV viremia of 4.6 log10 FFU/mL, LEPRDB/DB mice infected 36.3% of mosquitoes while control C57BL/6J mice with a viremia of 4.2 log10 FFU/mL infected only 4.1%. Additionally, when highly susceptible Ae. aegypti Rockefeller mosquitoes fed on homozygous LEPRDB/DB, heterozygous LEPRWT/DB, and control C57BL/6J mice with viremias of â?4 log10 FFU/mL, 54%, 15%, and 33% were infected, respectively. In total, these data suggest that the prevalence of T2DM in a population may have a significant impact on ZIKV transmission and indicates the need for further investigation of the impacts of pre-existing metabolic conditions on arbovirus transmission.",-1
The Durable Safety and Effectiveness of Lixisenatide in Japanese People with Type 2 Diabetes: The Post-Marketing Surveillance PRANDIAL Study,"Introduction:                    Real-world evidence on lixisenatide in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is lacking. Therefore, the 3-year post-marketing PRANDIAL study was conducted to evaluate the safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of lixisenatide in Japanese people with T2D during routine clinical practice.              Methods:                    This prospective, observational, multicenter, open-label study was conducted in Japanese individuals with T2D who initiated lixisenatide treatment between March 2014 and June 2017. Using electronic case report forms, investigators collected baseline demographic and clinical information and data on medications, safety and effectiveness up to 3 years after initiation of lixisenatide.              Results:                    Overall, 3046 participants were analyzed; their mean Â± standard deviation (SD) age was 58.9 Â± 13.1 years, and 53.7% were male. Mean Â± SD duration of T2D was 12.8 Â± 8.6 years, and baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8.7% Â± 1.7%. Most participants (93.9%) were receiving concomitant antidiabetic medications when they initiated lixisenatide. Median (range) lixisenatide treatment duration was 382 (1-1096) days. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 604 participants (19.8%) and serious ADRs in 22 (0.7%). The most common ADR was nausea (9.0%). Of ADRs of special interest, hypoglycemia occurred in 2.9% of participants, injection site reactions in 0.9%, and hypoglycemic unconsciousness in 0.03%. Baseline characteristics associated with an increased risk of ADRs (p < 0.05) were history of treatment for cardiovascular disease, hepatic dysfunction, and other complications. Effectiveness was analyzed in 2675 participants; HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and body weight all decreased significantly at last observation (all p < 0.0001 vs. baseline).              Conclusions:                    Lixisenatide was well tolerated, with no unexpected ADRs or new safety signals identified, and showed effective glycemic control and weight reduction up to 3 years, supporting the use of lixisenatide as a safe and effective treatment option for T2D in routine clinical practice in Japan.",-1
Pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes: Established Facts and New Insights,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing Î²-cells in pancreatic islets. It generally occurs in genetically susceptible individuals, and genetics plays a major role in the development of islet autoimmunity. Furthermore, these processes are heterogeneous among individuals; hence, different endotypes have been proposed. In this review, we highlight the interplay between genetic predisposition and other non-genetic factors, such as viral infections, diet, and gut biome, which all potentially contribute to the aetiology of T1D. We also discuss a possible active role for Î²-cells in initiating the pathological processes. Another component in T1D predisposition is epigenetic influences, which represent a link between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors and may account for some of the disease heterogeneity. Accordingly, a shift towards personalized therapies may improve the treatment results and, therefore, result in better outcomes for individuals in the long-run. There is also a clear need for a better understanding of the preclinical phases of T1D and finding new predictive biomarkers for earlier diagnosis and therapy, with the final goal of reverting or even preventing the development of the disease.",-1
HDAC Inhibitors Enhance Efficacy of the Oncolytic Adenoviruses Adââ and Ad-3â?A20T in Pancreatic and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Models,"The prognosis for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is dismal. TNBC and PDAC are highly aggressive cancers with few treatment options and a potential for rapid resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics. Oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds) represent a promising tumour-selective strategy that can overcome treatment resistance and eliminate cancer cells by lysis and host immune activation. We demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) potently enhanced the cancer-cell killing of our OAds, Adââ and Ad-3â?A20T in TNBC and PDAC preclinical models. In the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-436, SUM159 and CAL51, cell killing, viral uptake and replication were increased when treated with sublethal doses of the Class-I-selective HDACis Scriptaid, Romidepsin and MS-275. The pan-HDACi, TSA efficiently improved OAd efficacy, both in vitro and in SUM159 xenograft models in vivo. Cell killing and Adââ replication was also significantly increased in five PDAC cell lines when pre-treated with TSA. Efficacy was dependent on treatment time and dose, and on the specific genetic alterations in each cell line. Expression of the cancer specific Î±vÃ6-integrin supported higher viral uptake of the integrin-retargeted Ad-3â?A20T in combination with Scriptaid. In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibition of specific HDACs is a potential means to enhance OAd activity, supporting clinical translation.",-1
Diet leaves a genetic signature in a keystone member of the gut microbiota,"Switching from a low-fat and high-fiber diet to a Western-style high-fat and high-sugar diet causes microbiota imbalances that underlay many pathological conditions (i.e., dysbiosis). Although the effects of dietary changes on microbiota composition and functions are well documented, their impact in gut bacterial evolution remains unexplored. We followed the emergence of mutations in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prevalent fiber-degrading microbiota member, upon colonization of the murine gut under different dietary regimens. B. thetaiotaomicron evolved rapidly in the gut and Western-style diet selected for mutations that promote degradation of mucin-derived glycans. Periodic dietary changes caused fluctuations in the frequency of such mutations and were associated with metabolic shifts, resulting in the maintenance of higher intraspecies genetic diversity compared to constant dietary regimens. These results show that dietary changes leave a genetic signature in microbiome members and suggest that B. thetaiotaomicron genetic diversity could be a biomarker for dietary differences among individuals.",-1
The interaction of secreted phospholipase A2-IIA with the microbiota alters its lipidome and promotes inflammation,"Secreted phospholipase A2-IIA (sPLA2-IIA) hydrolyzes phospholipids to liberate lysophospholipids and fatty acids. Given its poor activity toward eukaryotic cell membranes, its role in the generation of proinflammatory lipid mediators is unclear. Conversely, sPLA2-IIA efficiently hydrolyzes bacterial membranes. Here, we show that sPLA2-IIA affects the immune system by acting on the intestinal microbial flora. Using mice overexpressing transgene-driven human sPLA2-IIA, we found that the intestinal microbiota was critical for both induction of an immune phenotype and promotion of inflammatory arthritis. The expression of sPLA2-IIA led to alterations of the intestinal microbiota composition, but housing in a more stringent pathogen-free facility revealed that its expression could affect the immune system in the absence of changes to the composition of this flora. In contrast, untargeted lipidomic analysis focusing on bacteria-derived lipid mediators revealed that sPLA2-IIA could profoundly alter the fecal lipidome. The data suggest that a singular protein, sPLA2-IIA, produces systemic effects on the immune system through its activity on the microbiota and its lipidome.",-1
"Effect of diurnal intermittent fasting during Ramadan on ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, and cortisol levels among overweight and obese subjects: A prospective observational study","Background:                    Levels of cortisol, melatonin, ghrelin, and leptin are highly correlated with circadian rhythmicity. The levels of these hormones are affected by sleep, feeding, and general behaviors, and fluctuate with light and dark cycles. During the fasting month of Ramadan, a shift to nighttime eating is expected to affect circadian rhythm hormones and, subsequently, the levels of melatonin, cortisol, ghrelin, and leptin. The present study aimed to examine the effect of diurnal intermittent fasting (DIF) during Ramadan on daytime levels of ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, and cortisol hormones in a group of overweight and obese subjects, and to determine how anthropometric, dietary, and lifestyle changes during the month of Ramadan correlate with these hormonal changes.              Methods:                    Fifty-seven overweight and obese male (40) and female (17) subjects were enrolled in this study. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake, sleep duration, and hormonal levels of serum ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, and salivary cortisol were assessed one week before the start of Ramadan fasting and after 28 days of fasting at fixed times of the day (11:00 am-1:00 pm).              Results:                    At the end of Ramadan, serum levels of ghrelin, melatonin, and leptin significantly (P<0.001) decreased, while salivary cortisol did not change compared to the levels assessed in the pre-fasting state.              Conclusions:                    DIF during Ramadan significantly altered serum levels of ghrelin, melatonin, and serum leptin. Further, male sex and anthropometric variables were the most impacting factors on the tested four hormones. Further studies are needed to assess DIF's impact on the circadian rhythmicity of overweight and obese fasting people.",-1
Intra peritoneal abdominal fat area measured from computed tomography is an independent factor of severe acute pancreatitis,"Purpose:                    The purpose of this study was to search for a possible relationship between acute pancreatitis (AP) severity and visceral fat (VF) surface on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).              Material and method:                    A total of 112 patients with AP who underwent CECT within 2 to 3 days after the beginning of AP were included. There were 68 mean and 44 women, with a mean age of 56.3Â±21.6 (SD) years (range: 19-98 years). AP was regarded as mild for patients with an hospital stay up to 5 days and severe for those with an hospital stay greater than 5 days. VF surface was measured on CECT at the level of L4-L5 and of the umbilicus. Association between AP severity and VF surface, computed tomography severity index (CTSI), modified CTSI (mCTSI) and other variables were searched for using uni- and multivariate analysis.              Results:                    At univariate analysis, the VF surface at the level of L4 was greater in patients with severe AP (129.3Â±68.6 [SD] cm2; range: 21.8-355.8 cm2) than in patients with mild AP (100.1Â±68.4 [SD] cm2; range:13.2-333 cm2) (P=0.006). Similarly, the VF surface at the umbilicus was greater in patients with severe AP (161.1Â±76.1 [SD] cm2; range: 31.3-376.7cm2) than in those with mild AP (128.4Â±74.3cm2; range: 12.8-323.1cm2) (P=0.024). CTSI and mCTSI were also associated to AP severity. At multivariate analysis, only VF surface either measured at the umbilical or at the L4-L5 level was associated with AP severity (P=0.017 and 0.006, respectively).              Conclusion:                    VF surface at the level of L4-L5 on CECT is an independent factor of AP severity. VF surface at the level of L4-L5 on CECT is an independent factor of AP severity. These results are in line with recent data on the role of abdominal fat in the genesis of inflammatory response, which is associated with severe forms of AP.",-1
"""It's disappointing and it's pretty frustrating, because it feels like it's something that will never go away."" A qualitative study exploring individuals' beliefs and experiences of Achilles tendinopathy","Background:                    Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common and often persistent musculoskeletal disorder affecting both athletic and non-athletic populations. Despite the relatively high incidence there is little insight into the impact and perceptions of tendinopathy from the individual's perspective. Increased awareness of the impact and perceptions around individuals' experiences with Achilles tendinopathy may provide crucial insights for the management of what is often a complex, persistent, and disabling MSK disorder.              Purpose:                    To qualitatively explore the lived experiences of individuals with AT.              Design:                    A qualitative, interpretive description design was performed using semi-structured telephone interviews.              Methods:                    Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 15 participants (8 male and 7 female) with AT. Thematic analysis was performed using the guidelines laid out by Braun and Clarke. The study has been reported in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist.              Results:                    Four main themes were identified from the data: 1) beliefs and perceptions surrounding AT: ""If I'm over training or something, I don't really know"", 2) the biopsychosocial impact of AT: ""I think it restricts me in a lot of things that I would be able to do"", 3) individuals' experiences with the management process: ""You want it to happen now. You're doing all this stuff and it's just very slow progress"", and 4) future prognosis and outlook in individuals with AT: ""I see myself better"".              Conclusions:                    This study offers a unique insight into the profound impact and consequences of Achilles tendinopathy in a mixed sample of both athletic and non-athletic individuals. The findings of this study have important clinical implications. Specifically, it highlights the need for clinicians to recognize and adopt treatment approaches to embrace a more biopsychosocial approach for the management of tendinopathy.",-1
Knockdown of lncRNA HAGLROS inhibits metastasis and promotes apoptosis in nephroblastoma cells by inhibition of autophagy,"Nephroblastoma, or Wilms tumor, is a primary renal malignant tumor that easily occurs in children. Previous studies have revealed the regulatory functions of LncRNA in nephroblastoma. LncRNA HAGLROS functions as a tumor promotor in various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. In this study, the HAGLROS expression in nephroblastoma cells was assayed through qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation assessment employed CCK-8. Moreover, the migration and invasion of cells were examined separately through wound healing and transwell assay. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis and Western blot assay were applied to evaluate cell apoptosis. Rapamycin and 3-methyladenine were used to serve as autophagy activator or inhibitor, respectively. In addition, autophagy was identified by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis. Experiment results showed that HAGLROS expressed highly in nephroblastoma cell lines. HAGLROS knockdown prevented cells from proliferating, and also showed suppressive impact on migration and invasion in HFWT cells. In addition, knockdown of HAGLROS showed a facilitative effect on apoptosis and an inhibitory effect on autophagy. Stimulation of autophagy alleviated HAGLROS silencing-induced apoptosis, while inhibition of autophagy reversed the effect in nephroblastoma cells. In summary, our results revealed that HAGLROS executed an oncogenic role in the progress of nephroblastoma, offering a new perspective on the strategy for nephroblastoma therapy.",-1
Detection of Dental Diseases through X-Ray Images Using Neural Search Architecture Network,"An important aspect of the diagnosis procedure in daily clinical practice is the analysis of dental radiographs. This is because the dentist must interpret different types of problems related to teeth, including the tooth numbers and related diseases during the diagnostic process. For panoramic radiographs, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can do multitask classification by classifying the X-ray images into three classes: cavity, filling, and implant. In this paper, convolutional neural networks are taken in the form of a NASNet model consisting of different numbers of max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and activation functions. Initially, the data will be augmented and preprocessed, and then, the construction of a multioutput model will be done. Finally, the model will compile and train the model; the evaluation parameters used for the analysis of the model are loss and the accuracy curves. The model has achieved an accuracy of greater than 96% such that it has outperformed other existing algorithms.",-1
The MITRE trial protocol: a study to evaluate the microbiome as a biomarker of efficacy and toxicity in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,"Background:                    The gut microbiome is implicated as a marker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) based on preclinical mouse models and preliminary observations in limited patient series. Furthermore, early studies suggest faecal microbial transfer may have therapeutic potential, converting ICI non-responders into responders. So far, identification of specific responsible bacterial taxa has been inconsistent, which limits future application. The MITRE study will explore and validate a microbiome signature in a larger scale prospective study across several different cancer types.              Methods:                    Melanoma, renal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients who are planned to receive standard immune checkpoint inhibitors are being recruited to the MITRE study. Longitudinal stool samples are collected prior to treatment, then at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months during treatment, or at disease progression/recurrence (whichever is sooner), as well as after a severe (â¥grade 3 CTCAE v5.0) immune-related adverse event. Additionally, whole blood, plasma, buffy coat, RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is collected at similar time points and will be used for exploratory analyses. Archival tumour tissue, tumour biopsies at progression/relapse, as well as any biopsies from body organs collected after a severe toxicity are collected. The primary outcome measure is the ability of the microbiome signature to predict 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced disease. Secondary outcomes include microbiome correlations with toxicity and other efficacy end-points. Biosamples will be used to explore immunological and genomic correlates. A sub-study will evaluate both COVID-19 antigen and antibody associations with the microbiome.              Discussion:                    There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, resistance and toxicity to immunotherapy. The data generated from this study will both help inform patient selection for these drugs and provide information that may allow therapeutic manipulation of the microbiome to improve future patient outcomes.

Association of Long Non-Coding RNA Growth Arrest-Specific 5 Genetic Variants with Diabetic Retinopathy,"The aim of this work was to appraise the potential associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of long non-coding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a diabetes mellitus (DM) population. Two loci of the GAS5 SNPs (rs55829688 and rs145204276) were genotyped via TaqMan allelic discrimination in 449 non-DR patients and 273 DR subjects. The SNP rs145204276 Del/Del showed a significantly higher distribution in the DR group compared to the non-DR group (AOR: 2.487, 95% CI: 1.424-4.344, p = 0.001). During subgroup analyses, the non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) subgroup demonstrated a significantly higher ratio of the SNP rs145204276 Del/Del (AOR: 2.917, 95% CI: 1.574-5.406, p = 0.001) and Ins/Del + Del/Del (AOR: 1.242, 95% CI: 1.016-1.519, p = 0.034) compared to the non-DR population, while the proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) subgroup did not reveal significant differences in either SNP rs145204276 or rs55829688 distributions compared to the non-DR group. Furthermore, patients with a GAS5 SNP rs145204276 Del/Del showed a significantly shorter DM duration than the wild type (Ins/Ins) (p = 0.021). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the GAS5 SNP rs145204276 Del/Del variant is associated with an increased susceptibility to DR in DM patients, particularly in those patients with NPDR.",-1
In Vitro Validation of the Therapeutic Potential of Dendrimer-Based Nanoformulations against Tumor Stem Cells,"Tumor cells with stem cell properties are considered to play major roles in promoting the development and malignant behavior of aggressive cancers. Therapeutic strategies that efficiently eradicate such tumor stem cells are of highest clinical need. Herein, we performed the validation of the polycationic phosphorus dendrimer-based approach for small interfering RNAs delivery in in vitro stem-like cells as models. As a therapeutic target, we chose Lyn, a member of the Src family kinases as an example of a prominent enzyme class widely discussed as a potent anti-cancer intervention point. Our selection is guided by our discovery that Lyn mRNA expression level in glioma, a class of brain tumors, possesses significant negative clinical predictive value, promoting its potential as a therapeutic target for future molecular-targeted treatments. We then showed that anti-Lyn siRNA, delivered into Lyn-expressing glioma cell model reduces the cell viability, a fact that was not observed in a cell model that lacks Lyn-expression. Furthermore, we have found that the dendrimer itself influences various parameters of the cells such as the expression of surface markers PD-L1, TIM-3 and CD47, targets for immune recognition and other biological processes suggested to be regulating glioblastoma cell invasion. Our findings prove the potential of dendrimer-based platforms for therapeutic applications, which might help to eradicate the population of cancer cells with augmented chemotherapy resistance. Moreover, the results further promote our functional stem cell technology as suitable component in early stage drug development.",-1
MicroRNA Cross-Involvement in Acne Vulgaris and Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Literature Review,"Acne Vulgaris (AV) and Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are common chronic inflammatory skin conditions that affect the follicular units that often coexist or are involved in differential diagnoses. Inflammation in both these diseases may result from shared pathways, which may partially explain their frequent coexistence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, short, non-protein coding, gene-silencing or promoting RNAs that may promote various inflammatory diseases. This narrative review investigates the current knowledge regarding miRNAs and their link to AV and HS. The aim is to examine the role of these molecules in the pathogenesis of AV and HS and to identify possible common miRNAs that could explain the similar characteristics of these two diseases. Five miRNA (miR-155 miR-223-, miR-21, and miRNA-146a) levels were found to be altered in both HS and AV. These miRNAs are related to pathogenetic aspects common to both pathologies, such as the regulation of the innate immune response, regulation of the Th1/Th17 axis, and fibrosis processes that induce scar formation. This review provides a starting point for further studies aimed at investigating the role of miRNAs in AV and HS for their possible use as diagnostic-therapeutic targets.",-1
Disruption of Mitochondrial Homeostasis: The Role of PINK1 in Parkinson's Disease,"The progressive reduction of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra is the fundamental process underlying Parkinson's disease (PD), while the mechanism of susceptibility of this specific neuronal population is largely unclear. Disturbances in mitochondrial function have been recognized as one of the main pathways in sporadic PD since the finding of respiratory chain impairment in animal models of PD. Studies on genetic forms of PD have provided new insight on the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics, homeostasis, and autophagy. PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) gene mutations, although rare, are the second most common cause of recessively inherited early-onset PD, after Parkin gene mutations. Our knowledge of PINK1 and Parkin function has increased dramatically in the last years, with the discovery that a process called mitophagy, which plays a key role in the maintenance of mitochondrial health, is mediated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway. In vitro and in vivo models have been developed, supporting the role of PINK1 in synaptic transmission, particularly affecting dopaminergic neurons. It is of paramount importance to further define the role of PINK1 in mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis in PD pathogenesis in order to delineate novel therapeutic targets.",-1
"From Tissue Physoxia to Cancer Hypoxia, Cost-Effective Methods to Study Tissue-Specific O 2 Levels in Cellular Biology","The human body is endowed with an extraordinary ability to maintain different oxygen levels in various tissues and organs. The maintenance of physiological levels of oxygen is known as physoxia. The development of hypoxic conditions plays an important role in the biology of several pathologies, including cancer. In vitro studies using normal and neoplastic cells require that culture conditions be carried out under appropriate oxygen levels, either physoxic or hypoxic conditions. Such requirements are difficult to widely implement in laboratory practice, mainly due to the high costs of specialized equipment. In this work, we present and characterize a cost-effective method to culture cells under a range of oxygen levels using deoxidizing pouches. Our results show that physoxic and hypoxic levels using deoxidizing absorbers can be achieved either by implementing a gradual change in oxygen levels or by a regimen of acute depletion of oxygen. This approach triggers the activation of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells while stimulating the expression of HIF-1Î±. Culturing cancer cells with deoxidizing agent pouches revealed PI3K oncogenic pathway exacerbations compared to tumor cells growing under atmospheric levels of oxygen. Similar to the PI3K signaling disturbance, we also observed augmented oxidative stress and superoxide levels and increased cell cycle arrest. Most interestingly, the culture of cancer cells under hypoxia resulted in the accumulation of cancer stem cells in a time-dependent manner. Overall, we present an attractive, cost-effective method of culturing cells under appropriate physoxic or hypoxic conditions that is easily implementable in any wet laboratory equipped with cell culture tools.",-1
Arene Ru(II) Complexes Acted as Potential KRAS G-Quadruplex DNA Stabilizer Induced DNA Damage Mediated Apoptosis to Inhibit Breast Cancer Progress,"A series of arene Ru(II) complexes, [(Î·6-MeC6H5)Ru(L)Cl]Cl, (L=o-ClPIP, 1; m-ClPIP, 2 and p-ClPIP, 3) (o-ClPIP=2-(2-chlorophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline; m-ClPIP=2-(3-chlorophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline; p-ClPIP=2-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]phenanthroline) was synthesized and investigated as a potential apoptosis inducer in chemotherapy. Spectroscopy and molecular docking simulations show that 1 exhibits moderated binding affinity to KRAS G-quadruplex DNA by groove mode. Further, in vitro studies reveal that 1 displays inhibitory activity against MCF-7 growth with IC50 = 3.7 Â± 0.2 Î¼M. Flow cytometric analysis, comet assay, and immunofluorescence confirm that 1 can induce the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells and G0/G1 phase arrest through DNA damage. In summary, the prepared arene Ru(II) complexes can be developed as a promising candidate for targeting G-quadruplex structure to induce the apoptosis of breast cancer cells via binding and stabilizing KRAS G-quadruplex conformation on oncogene promoter.",-1
Characterization and Vector Competence Studies of Chikungunya Virus Lacking Repetitive Motifs in the 3' Untranslated Region of the Genome,"Using reverse genetics, we analyzed a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) isolate of the Indian Ocean lineage lacking direct repeat (DR) elements in the 3' untranslated region, namely DR1a and DR2a. While this deletion mutant CHIKV-âDR exhibited growth characteristics comparable to the wild-type virus in Baby Hamster Kidney cells, replication of the mutant was reduced in Aedes albopictus C6/36 and Ae. aegypti Aag2 cells. Using oral and intrathoracic infection of mosquitoes, viral infectivity, dissemination, and transmission of CHIKV-âDR could be shown for the well-known CHIKV vectors Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Oral infection of Ae. vexans and Culex pipiens mosquitoes with mutant or wild-type CHIKV showed very limited infectivity. Dissemination, transmission, and transmission efficiencies as determined via viral RNA in the saliva were slightly higher in Ae. vexans for the wild-type virus than for CHIKV-âDR. However, both Ae. vexans and Cx. pipiens allowed efficient viral replication after intrathoracic injection confirming that the midgut barrier is an important determinant for the compromised infectivity after oral infection. Transmission efficiencies were neither significantly different between Ae. vexans and Cx. pipiens nor between wild-type and CHIKV-âDR. With a combined transmission efficiency of 6%, both Ae. vexans and Cx. pipiens might serve as potential vectors in temperate regions.",-1
Deep learning for dose assessment in radiotherapy by the super-localization of vaporized nanodroplets in high frame rate ultrasound imaging,"Objective.External beam radiotherapy is aimed to precisely deliver a high radiation dose to malignancies, while optimally sparing surrounding healthy tissues. With the advent of increasingly complex treatment plans, the delivery should preferably be verified by quality assurance methods. Recently, online ultrasound imaging of vaporized radiosensitive nanodroplets was proposed as a promising tool forin vivodosimetry in radiotherapy. Previously, the detection of sparse vaporization events was achieved by applying differential ultrasound (US) imaging followed by intensity thresholding using subjective parameter tuning, which is sensitive to image artifacts.Approach. A generalized deep learning solution (i.e. BubbleNet) is proposed to localize vaporized nanodroplets on differential US frames, while overcoming the aforementioned limitation. A 5-fold cross-validation was performed on a diversely composed 5747-frame training/validation dataset by manual segmentation. BubbleNet was then applied on a test dataset of 1536 differential US frames to evaluate dosimetric features. The intra-observer variability was determined by scoring the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on 150 frames segmented twice. Additionally, the BubbleNet generalization capability was tested on an external test dataset of 432 frames acquired by a phased array transducer at a much lower ultrasound frequency and reconstructed with unconventional pixel dimensions with respect to the training dataset.Main results.The median DSC in the 5-fold cross validation was equal to â?.88, which was in line with the intra-observer variability (=0.86). Next, BubbleNet was employed to detect vaporizations in differential US frames obtained during the irradiation of phantoms with a 154 MeV proton beam or a 6 MV photon beam. BubbleNet improved the bubble-count statistics by â?0% compared to the earlier established intensity-weighted thresholding. The proton range was verified with a -0.8 mm accuracy.Significance.BubbleNet is a flexible tool to localize individual vaporized nanodroplets on experimentally acquired US images, which improves the sensitivity compared to former thresholding-weighted methods.",-1
MicroRNA-21 Expression as a Prognostic Biomarker in Oral Cancer: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Oral carcinoma represents one of the main carcinomas of the head and neck region, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 50%. Smoking and tobacco use are recognized risk factors. Prognostic survival biomarkers can be a valid tool for assessing a patient's life expectancy and directing therapy towards specific targets. Among the biomarkers, the alteration of miR-21 expression in tumor tissues is increasingly reported as a valid prognostic biomarker of survival for oral cancer. The purpose of this meta-analysis was, therefore, to investigate and summarize the results in the literature concerning the potential prognostic expression of tissue miR-21 in patients with OSCC.              Methods:                    The systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines using electronic databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, with the use of combinations of keywords, such as miR-21 AND oral cancer, microRNA AND oral cancer, and miR-21. The meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.41 software.              Results:                    At the end of the article-selection process, 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and the result for the main outcome was a pooled HR per overall survival (OS) of 1.29 (1.16-1.44) between high and low expression of miR-21.              Conclusions:                    The data in the literature and the results emerging from the systematic review indicate that miR-21 can provide a prognostic indication in oral cancer.",-1
SPOROS: A pipeline to analyze DISE/6mer seed toxicity,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are (18-22nt long) noncoding short (s)RNAs that suppress gene expression by targeting the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs. This occurs through the seed sequence located in position 2-7/8 of the miRNA guide strand, once it is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). G-rich 6mer seed sequences can kill cells by targeting C-rich 6mer seed matches located in genes that are critical for cell survival. This results in induction of Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE), through a mechanism we have called 6mer seed toxicity. miRNAs are often quantified in cells by aligning the reads from small (sm)RNA sequencing to the genome. However, the analysis of any smRNA Seq data set for predicted 6mer seed toxicity requires an alternative workflow, solely based on the exact position 2-7 of any short (s)RNA that can enter the RISC. Therefore, we developed SPOROS, a semi-automated pipeline that produces multiple useful outputs to predict and compare 6mer seed toxicity of cellular sRNAs, regardless of their nature, between different samples. We provide two examples to illustrate the capabilities of SPOROS: Example one involves the analysis of RISC-bound sRNAs in a cancer cell line (either wild-type or two mutant lines unable to produce most miRNAs). Example two is based on a publicly available smRNA Seq data set from postmortem brains (either from normal or Alzheimer's patients). Our methods (found at https://github.com/ebartom/SPOROS and at Code Ocean: https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.1732496.v1) are designed to be used to analyze a variety of smRNA Seq data in various normal and disease settings.",-1
Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment and Immunotherapy of Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Malignancies,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause different types of cancer in human beings when the virus infects different cell types with various latent patterns. EBV shapes a distinct and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) to its benefit by influencing and interacting with different components in the TME. Different EBV-associated malignancies adopt similar but slightly specific immunosuppressive mechanisms by encoding different EBV products to escape both innate and adaptive immune responses. Strategies reversing the immunosuppressive TME of EBV-associated malignancies have been under evaluation in clinical practice. As the interactions among EBV, tumor cells, and TME are intricate, in this review, we mainly discuss the epidemiology of EBV, the life cycle of EBV, the cellular and molecular composition of TME, and a landscape of different EBV-associated malignancies and immunotherapy by targeting the TME.",-1
miRNAs as Predictive Factors in Early Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,"Introduction:                    Circulating miRNAs are important mediators in epigenetic changes. These non-coding molecules regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by binding to mRNA. As a result, they influence the development of many diseases, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Therefore, this study investigates the changes in the miRNA profile in GDM patients before hyperglycemia appears.              Materials and methods:                    The study group consisted of 24 patients with GDM, and the control group was 24 normoglycemic pregnant women who were matched for body mass index (BMI), age, and gestational age. GDM was diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test between the 24th and 26th weeks of pregnancy. The study had a prospective design, and serum for analysis was obtained in the first trimester of pregnancy. Circulating miRNAs were measured using the NanoString quantitative assay platform. Validation with real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on the same group of patients. Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman correlation were done to assess the significance of the results.              Results:                    Among the 800 miRNAs, 221 miRNAs were not detected, and 439 were close to background noise. The remaining miRNAs were carefully investigated for their average counts, fold changes, p-values, and false discovery rate (FDR) scores. We selected four miRNAs for further validation: miR-16-5p, miR-142-3p, miR-144-3p, and miR-320e, which showed the most prominent changes between the studied groups. The validation showed up-regulation of miR-16-5p (p<0.0001), miR-142-3p (p=0.001), and miR-144-3p (p=0.003).              Conclusion:                    We present changes in miRNA profile in the serum of GDM women, which may indicate significance in the pathophysiology of GDM. These findings emphasize the role of miRNAs as a predictive factor that could potentially be useful in early diagnosis.",-1
Adipokine profiles in preeclampsia,"Objectives: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including preeclampsia (PE), are associated with short- and long-term maternal health complications, and obesity is a leading attributable risk factor for HDP. Yet, most women identified as obese [by body mass index (BMI) â?30 kg/m2] do not develop HDP, indicating limited predictability of BMI alone. In nonpregnant populations, increased visceral fat mass (VFM) is an obesity-associated phenotype increasing the risk of developing hypertension. We sought to assess whether, in pregnancy, obese women with PE would have higher circulating levels of adipokines preferential to VFM compared to obese women without PE.Study Design: We performed a case-control study of women with and without PE, including obese (n = 65; BMI â?30 kg/m2) and normal weight (n = 52; BMI 18.4-24.9 kg/m2) women. Plasma concentrations of adipokines preferential to VFM (visfatin, resistin), adipokines reflecting overall adiposity (leptin, adiponectin), and inflammatory cytokines were compared.Results: We found that among obese women, cases had significantly higher levels of VFM-associated adipokines and cytokines compared to controls [visfatin (p < .01, t = -3.8), resistin (p = .002, t = 1.12), IFN gamma (p = .04, t = -2.0), IL-6 (p < .01, t = -2.65), IL1-beta (p < .01, t = -4.1), IL-2 (p < .01, t = -3.9)]. Interestingly, however, obese and normal weight cases had similar VFM-adipokine and cytokine levels [visfatin (p = .34, t = -0.35), resistin (p = .55, t = -0.25)], and inflammatory marker concentrations [IFN gamma (p = .86, t = -0.76), IL-6 (p = .91, t = -0.53), IL-1beta (p = .67, t = 1.18), and IL-2 (p = .45, t = -1.16)]. These data possibly suggest an association between VFM and PE that is present independent of BMI.Conclusion: In summary, we demonstrated that, in normal-weight and obese women, PE was associated with higher concentrations of VFM-preferential adipokines compared to normal-weight and obese controls without PE.",-1
A Low-Calorie Diet with or without Exercise Reduces Postprandial Aortic Waveform in Females with Obesity,"Purpose:                    Arterial stiffness is considered a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Females have higher values of arterial stiffness than males, suggesting a greater risk of heart-related complications. Although a low-calorie diet (LCD) reduces fasting arterial stiffness, in part through weight loss, it is unknown if interval exercise (INT) adds to the benefit of LCD on fasting and postprandial arterial stiffness in females with obesity.              Methods:                    Twenty-five females (47 Â± 2.6 yr, 37.6 Â± 1.3 kgÂ·m-2) were randomized to 13 d of LCD (n = 12; mixed meals of ~1200 kcalÂ·d-1) or LCD + INT (n = 13; 60 minÂ·d-1 of supervised 3-min intervals at 90% HRpeak and 50% HRpeak). Arterial stiffness (augmentation index [AIx] and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity [cfPWV]) and blood biochemistries were measured during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test before and after the intervention to determine fasting and postprandial arterial stiffness as well as insulin sensitivity (simple index of insulin sensitivity [SIIS]) and inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha).              Results:                    Although LCD + INT increased VËO2peak and HDL compared with LCD (P = 0.04 and P < 0.01, respectively), both interventions decreased body fat, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides (all P < 0.01) and increased SIIS (P = 0.03). Despite no effect on fasting AIx (P = 0.27), LCD and LCD + INT decreased AIx60min (-7.4% Â± 4.3% vs -7.0% Â± 5.0%, P = 0.04) and tAUC120min (-663 Â± 263 vs -457 Â± 406, P = 0.03). There were no changes in fasting cfPWV (P = 0.91) or cfPWV120min (P = 0.62). Increased SIIS and decreased interleukin 8 were associated with reduced fasting AIx (r = -0.44, P = 0.03, and r = 0.40, P = 0.055), whereas decreased C-reactive protein correlated with reduced postprandial AIx60min (r = 0.43, P = 0.04).              Conclusion:                    Independent of exercise, 13 d of LCD reduces postprandial AIx in females with obesity. Insulin sensitivity and inflammation correlated with improved arterial stiffness, suggesting unique mechanisms regulate fasted versus postprandial arterial stiffness.",-1
Claims of anomalously long fasting: An assessment of the evidence from investigated cases,"Background:                    Throughout history and to the present day, there have been reports of people claiming inedia, i.e., an anomalous long-term abstinence from food or from food and fluid. Some were isolated and monitored and their abstinences confirmed. This raises the question of whether there may be an anomaly with wide implications that science has overlooked. On the other hand, there have been cases of exposed fraud. The reports on the studies are scattered and it can be difficult to judge their rigor and the strength and implications of their evidence. A critical evaluation seems useful.              Objectives:                    The objectives were to obtain an overview of investigated cases of claimed inedia, to assess the anomaly of the claims and study results, to assess the quality of the studies, and to identify deception methods to inform future safeguards.              Method:                    I developed criteria for differentiating normal from anomalous nutrition and fasting and for assessing the quality of inedia studies. Studies found through a systematic search were then assessed and the features of cases of fraud extracted.              Results:                    47 eligible investigations of 38 claimants were found. Out of the 38 cases, results were assessed as (seemingly) anomalous in 11, with nine cases of monitored food and fluid deprivation ranging from 14 to 68 days (median 28 days), and two cases of food deprivation for 365 and 411 days. In 17 cases, anomaly was assessed as not confirmed due to issues with study design or reporting. Fraud was established in 10 cases. Deception methods were creative. Post-1900 studies were also assessed for quality. Quality was not considered adequate in any.              Conclusions:                    I consider the evidential status of inedia unconfirmed as no assessed study had both anomalous findings and impeccable quality. However, quality was often downgraded due to reporting issues and it cannot be concluded in reverse that all claimants with anomalous results were able to deceive the investigators. The results of many studies are curious and demand further research. The conducted analysis provides guidance for improving rigor and transparency in future studies.",-1
Anticholinergic Medication Burden in Parkinson's Disease Outpatients,"Background:                    Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) may be especially vulnerable to future cognitive decline from anticholinergic medications.              Objective:                    To characterize anticholinergic medication burden, determine the co-occurrence of anticholinergic and cholinesterase inhibitors, and to assess the correlations among anticholinergic burden scales in PD outpatients.              Methods:                    We studied 670 PD outpatients enrolled in a clinic registry between 2012 and 2020. Anticholinergic burden was measured with the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale (ACB), Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS), Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS), and Drug Burden Index-Anticholinergic component (DBI-Ach). Correlations between scales were assessed with weighted kappa coefficients.              Results:                    Between 31.5 to 46.3% of PD patients were taking medications with anticholinergic properties. Among the scales applied, the ACB produced the highest prevalence of medications with anticholinergic properties (46.3%). Considering only medications with definite anticholinergic activity (scores of 2 or 3 on ACB, ADS, or ARS), the most common anticholinergic drug classes were antiparkinsonian (8.2%), antipsychotic (6.4%), and urological (3.3%) medications. Cholinesterase inhibitors and medications with anticholinergic properties were co-prescribed to 5.4% of the total cohort. The most highly correlated scales were ACB and ADS (Îº= 0.71), ACB and ARS (Îº= 0.67), and ADS and ARS (Îº= 0.55).              Conclusion:                    A high proportion of PD patients (20%) were either taking antiparkinsonian, urological, or antipsychotic anticholinergic medications or were co-prescribed anticholinergic medications and cholinesterase inhibitors. By virtue of its detection of a high prevalence of anticholinergic medication usage and its high correlation with other scales, our data support use of the ACB scale to assess anticholinergic burden in PD patients.",-1
"Effect of host genetics on the gut microbiome in 7,738 participants of the Dutch Microbiome Project","Host genetics are known to influence the gut microbiome, yet their role remains poorly understood. To robustly characterize these effects, we performed a genome-wide association study of 207 taxa and 205 pathways representing microbial composition and function in 7,738 participants of the Dutch Microbiome Project. Two robust, study-wide significant (P < 1.89 Ã 10-10) signals near the LCT and ABO genes were found to be associated with multiple microbial taxa and pathways and were replicated in two independent cohorts. The LCT locus associations seemed modulated by lactose intake, whereas those at ABO could be explained by participant secretor status determined by their FUT2 genotype. Twenty-two other loci showed suggestive evidence (P < 5 Ã 10-8) of association with microbial taxa and pathways. At a more lenient threshold, the number of loci we identified strongly correlated with trait heritability, suggesting that much larger sample sizes are needed to elucidate the remaining effects of host genetics on the gut microbiome.",-1
Acrometastasis of Laryngeal Carcinoma to the Finger,"Distant metastasis of laryngeal carcinoma occurs at the rate of 4%-12%, with the most common sites being the lungs, liver and bone. Acrometastasis occurs rarely in cases of laryngeal carcinoma; to date, only three cases of acrometastasis have been reported. Herein, we describe a 66-year male, who was followed up for metastatic laryngeal carcinoma and developed paronychia. Hot compress was applied, antibiotic treatment was administered, and fine-needle biopsy of the lesion was performed. The lesion did not regress despite the administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The results of cytological examinations were consistent with squamous cell carcinoma metastasis. Rarely occurring acrometastases indicate poor prognosis in cancer patients; expected survival is short and treatment is usually palliative. In such cases, finger amputation or local radiotherapy are recommended. Clinicians should be aware when treating metastatic laryngeal cancer that such atypical lesions as paronychia can be associated with the primary tumour. Key Words: Acrometastasis, Laryngeal carcinoma, Finger, Metastasis.",-1
A knockout screen of genes expressed specifically in Ae. aegypti pupae reveals a critical role for stretchin in mosquito flight,"Aedes aegypti is a critical vector for transmitting Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses to humans. Genetic strategies to limit mosquito survival based upon sex distortion or disruption of development may be valuable new tools to control Ae. aegypti populations. We identified six genes with expression limited to pupal development; osi8 and osi11 (Osiris protein family), CPRs and CPF (cuticle protein family), and stretchin (a muscle protein). Heritable CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout of these genes did not reveal any defects in pupal development. However, stretchin-null mutations (strnÎ35/Î41) resulted in flightless mosquitoes with an abnormal open wing posture. The inability of adult strnÎ35/Î41 mosquitoes to fly restricted their escape from aquatic rearing media following eclosion, and substantially reduced adult survival rates. Transgenic strains which contain the EGFP marker gene under the control of strn regulatory regions (0.8 kb, 1.4 kb, and 2.2 kb upstream, respectively), revealed the gene expression pattern of strn in muscle-like tissues in the thorax during late morphogenesis from L4 larvae to young adults. We demonstrated that Ae. aegypti pupae-specific strn is critical for adult mosquito flight capability and a key late-acting lethal target for mosquito-borne disease control.",-1
Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) and MMTV-like Viruses: An In-depth Look at a Controversial Issue,"Since its discovery as a milk factor, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been shown to cause mammary carcinoma and lymphoma in mice. MMTV infection depends upon a viral superantigen (sag)-induced immune response and exploits the immune system to establish infection in mammary epithelial cells when they actively divide. Simultaneously, it avoids immune responses, causing tumors through insertional mutagenesis and clonal expansion. Early studies identified antigens and sequences belonging to a virus homologous to MMTV in human samples. Several pieces of evidence fulfill a criterion for a possible causal role for the MMTV-like virus in human breast cancer (BC), though the controversy about whether this virus was linked to BC has raged for over 40 years in the literature. In this review, the most important issues related to MMTV, from its discovery to the present days, are retraced to fully explore such a controversial issue. Furthermore, the hypothesis of an MMTV-like virus raised the question of a potential zoonotic mouse-man transmission. Several studies investigate the role of an MMTV-like virus in companion animals, suggesting their possible role as mediators. Finally, the possibility of an MMTV-like virus as a cause of human BC opens a new era for prevention and therapy.",-1
Comparative Analysis of microRNA Binding Site Distribution and microRNA-Mediated Gene Expression Repression of Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of short, noncoding RNAs that can regulate gene expression levels of over half of the human genome. Previous studies on the role of miRNAs in cancer showed overall widespread downregulation of miRNAs as a hallmark of human cancer, though individual miRNAs can be both tumor suppressive and oncogenic, and cancer genes are speculated to be more targeted by miRNA. However, the extents to which oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TSG) are controlled by miRNA have not been compared. To achieve this goal, we constructed lists of oncogenes and TSGs and compared them with each other, and with the whole protein-coding gene population, in terms of miRNA binding sites distribution and expression level changes upon genetic disruption of miRNA production. As expected, the results show that cancer gene mRNAs anchor more miRNA binding sites, and are under a higher degree of miRNA-mediated repression at both mRNA abundance and translation efficiency levels than the whole protein-coding gene population. Importantly, on average, TSG mRNAs are more highly targeted and regulated by miRNA than oncogene mRNAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparison of miRNA regulation of oncogenes and TSGs.",-1
Associations between birth weight and glucose intolerance in adulthood among Greenlandic Inuit,"Aims:                    To examine the association between birth weight and glucose intolerance in adult Greenlandic Inuit.              Methods:                    We examined 1429 participants aged 18-56 years from two population-based, cross-sectional studies in Greenland with information on birth weight. Oral glucose tolerance tests, anthropometric measures and ultrasound of abdominal tissue were performed. Associations of birth weight with glucose markers were analysed using linear or logistic regressions. Spline analyses were conducted to examine u-shaped associations. Adjustments were done for age, sex, birth place, family history of diabetes, genetic admixture, TBC1D4 p.Arg684Ter carrier status, BMI and visceral adipose tissue.              Results:                    The median birthweight was 3300 g and 3.9% had type 2 diabetes, T2DM. Spline analyses indicated overall linear associations. In fully adjusted analyses, an increase in birth weight of 1 kg was associated with a change in fasting plasma glucose of -0.06 mmol/L (95%CI: -0.11, -0.01), 2-h plasma glucose of -0.16 mmol/L (95%CI: -0.35, 0.02), HOMA-IR of -5.45% (95%CI: -10.34, -0.29), insulin sensitivity index of 7.04% (95%CI: 1.88, 12.45) and a trend towards a reduced risk of hyperglycaemia and T2DM, although statistically insignificant.              Conclusions:                    Birth weight was inversely associated with hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance independently of adult adiposity. Thus, the findings support low birth weight as a contributing factor for glucose intolerance in adult Inuit in Greenland.",-1
Recent Advances of m6A Demethylases Inhibitors and Their Biological Functions in Human Diseases,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a post-transcriptional RNA modification and one of the most abundant types of RNA chemical modifications. m6A functions as a molecular switch and is involved in a range of biomedical aspects, including cardiovascular diseases, the central nervous system, and cancers. Conceptually, m6A methylation can be dynamically and reversibly modulated by RNA methylation regulatory proteins, resulting in diverse fates of mRNAs. This review focuses on m6A demethylases fat-mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO) and alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), which especially erase m6A modification from target mRNAs. Recent advances have highlighted that FTO and ALKBH5 play an oncogenic role in various cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemias (AML), glioblastoma, and breast cancer. Moreover, studies in vitro and in mouse models confirmed that FTO-specific inhibitors exhibited anti-tumor effects in several cancers. Accumulating evidence has suggested the possibility of FTO and ALKBH5 as therapeutic targets for specific diseases. In this review, we aim to illustrate the structural properties of these two m6A demethylases and the development of their specific inhibitors. Additionally, this review will summarize the biological functions of these two m6A demethylases in various types of cancers and other human diseases.",-1
Effects of probiotics on cognitive and emotional functions in healthy older adults: Protocol for a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial,"Aging is a process that includes changes in cognitive and emotional functions, as well as changes in the diversity and integrity of gut microbiota. Probiotic treatments have recently been studied as a potential new therapeutic approach to alleviate a wide range of problems in other populations; however, clinical studies in older adults remain insufficient and limited. Thus, the aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of a multispecies probiotic formulation as a therapeutic strategy for attenuating the emotional and cognitive decline associated with aging in adults over the age of 55. This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial involving at least 32 older adults and comparing two conditions: (a) probiotic, providing a multispecies probiotic for 10 weeks (Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium lactis); and (b) placebo, receiving a harmless substance (potato starch). Despite the increasing use of probiotics for the treatment of cognitive and emotional problems, no study has yet focused on this group, to the best of our knowledge. Therapeutic strategies of the kind outlined in this protocol will help to shed light on the current state of knowledge about this topic, as well as promote health programs tailored to this population, which would encourage active aging and healthy lifestyles. Not only do we expect improvements in the emotional dimension in terms of anxiety, stress, depression, and sleep quality, we also expect improvements in the cognitive dimension in terms of attention, memory, and decreased impulsivity.",-1
"Long non-coding RNA LINC01123 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion via interacting with SRSF7 in colorectal cancer","Background:                    Increasing evidences demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participates in the occurrence and development of cancer. In this study, we explored the function and molecular mechanism of LINC01123 in colorectal cancer progression.              Methods:                    Analyze the expression level of LINC01123 in gastrointestinal tumors via TCGA database. Colorectal tumor tissues and normal tissues were collected to detect the expression of LINC01123 by RT-qPCR. CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, transwell assay, and wound healing assays were used to explore the effects of LINC01123 on the proliferation, invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cells. Coomassie blue staining, RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry were used to screen the protein interacted with LINC01123. Xenograft model was used to explore the effect of LINC01123 in vivo.              Results:                    LINC01123 was up-regulated in colorectal cancer tumor tissues. The proliferation, invasion and migration ability of colorectal cancer cells were decreased significantly after LINC01123 knockdown, and it may inhibit its expression by interacted with SRSF7, thereby promoting colorectal cancer progression.              Conclusions:                    LINC01123 can promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cells by regulating SRSF7, suggesting that it may be an important regulator of colorectal cancer progression.",-1
The impact of a competitive event and the efficacy of a lactic acid bacteria-fermented soymilk extract on the gut microbiota and urinary metabolites of endurance athletes: An open-label pilot study,"Diet and exercise can alter the gut microbiota, but recent studies have assessed the impact of athletic competition on gut microbiota and host metabolites. We designed an open-label pilot study to investigate the effects of both official competition and a multi-strain lactic acid bacteria-fermented soymilk extract (LEX) on the gut microbiota in Japanese college endurance athletes. The analysis of fecal 16S rRNA metagenome and urinary metabolites was used to identify changes in gut microbiota composition and host metabolism. When the fecal microbiota were investigated before and after a race without using of a supplement (pre-observation period), there was an increase in the phylum Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes. However, no changes in these phyla were seen before and after a race in those who consumed LEX. Before and after LEX ingestion, changes in urinary metabolites included a significant reduction in yeast and fungal markers, neurotransmitters, and mitochondrial metabolites including the TCA cycle. There were several correlations between urinary metabolites and the composition of fecal microbiota. For example, the level of tricarballylic acid was positively correlated with the composition ratio of phylum Firmicutes (Pearson's r = 0.66; p < 0.01). The bacterial species Parabacteroides distasonis was also found to correlate moderately with several urinary metabolites. These findings suggest two possibilities. First, endurance athletes experience significant fluctuations in gut microbiota after a single competition. Second, LEX ingestion may improve yeast and fungal overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract and enhancing mitochondrial metabolic function.",-1
Effect of 1-Deoxynojirimycin on insulin resistance in prediabetic mice based on next-generation sequencing and intestinal microbiota study,"Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    1-Deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), the major alkaloid in Morus alba L., is the main effective constituent in ""Mulberry twig Alkaloids Tablets"" launched in China in 2020. Prediabetes, characterized by insulin resistance, is regarded as the key period for reversing Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through lifestyle intervention and glucose-lowering drugs. Besides the excellent activity as an Î±-glucosidase inhibitor, DNJ also improves insulin sensitivity in T2DM murine models, yet the mechanism is still unclear. Besides, the pharmaceutical effect of DNJ on prediabetes is also undocumented.              Aim of the study:                    The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmaceutical effect of DNJ on high-fat and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced prediabetes mice, and to elucidate the mechanism of insulin resistance ameliorated by DNJ.              Materials and methods:                    Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were performed to detect blood glucose level and insulin sensitivity in mice. The levels of circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) in the plasma of mice were measured by limulus reagent and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and intestinal microbiota sequencing were used to screen the alterations in the transcriptome of liver tissues and to assess the differences in intestinal flora composition, respectively. Expression of cytokine signaling pathway inhibitor 3 (SOCS3), insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), p-IRS1 (Tyr896), occludin, and toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway were confirmed by western blotting.              Results:                    Our study revealed that DNJ decreased the blood glucose level and improve insulin sensitivity in prediabetic mice. DNJ significantly reduced the relative risk of T2DM in prediabetic mice by approximately 83.7%. Mechanistically, DNJ treatment suppressed the circulating levels of LPS, IL-6, and TNF-Î± in plasma and decreased the inflammatory infiltration in liver and colon tissues. DNJ-treatment increased the abundance of Akkermansia, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus, and decreased the abundance of Enterococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Moreover, DNJ suppressed the expression of SOCS3 and the activity of TLR4/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, meanwhile improving the expression of occludin and the ratio of p-IRS1 (Tyr896)/IRS1.              Conclusions:                    DNJ effectively ameliorates glucose and lipid metabolism in prediabetic mice, and decreased the relative risk of progression into T2DM from prediabetes. The suppressed immune responses play essential roles in the improvement of insulin resistance by DNJ treatment. In conclusion, DNJ from Morus alba L. is a promising alternative agent in T2DM prevention.",-1
Identifying clinical subtypes in sepsis-survivors with different one-year outcomes: a secondary latent class analysis of the FROG-ICU cohort,"Background:                    Late mortality risk in sepsis-survivors persists for years with high readmission rates and low quality of life. The present study seeks to link the clinical sepsis-survivors heterogeneity with distinct biological profiles at ICU discharge and late adverse events using an unsupervised analysis.              Methods:                    In the original FROG-ICU prospective, observational, multicenter study, intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis on admission (Sepsis-3) were identified (N = 655). Among them, 467 were discharged alive from the ICU and included in the current study. Latent class analysis was applied to identify distinct sepsis-survivors clinical classes using readily available data at ICU discharge. The primary endpoint was one-year mortality after ICU discharge.              Results:                    At ICU discharge, two distinct subtypes were identified (A and B) using 15 readily available clinical and biological variables. Patients assigned to subtype B (48% of the studied population) had more impaired cardiovascular and kidney functions, hematological disorders and inflammation at ICU discharge than subtype A. Sepsis-survivors in subtype B had significantly higher one-year mortality compared to subtype A (respectively, 34% vs 16%, p < 0.001). When adjusted for standard long-term risk factors (e.g., age, comorbidities, severity of illness, renal function and duration of ICU stay), subtype B was independently associated with increased one-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.74 (95% CI 1.16-2.60); p = 0.006).              Conclusions:                    A subtype with sustained organ failure and inflammation at ICU discharge can be identified from routine clinical and laboratory data and is independently associated with poor long-term outcome in sepsis-survivors.

Cerebral Glutamate Regulation and Receptor Changes in Perioperative Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Dysfunction,"Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is intricately linked to learning and memory. Its activity depends on the expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors and excitatory amino transporters on neurons and glial cells. Glutamate transporters prevent the excess accumulation of glutamate in synapses, which can lead to aberrant synaptic signaling, excitotoxicity, or cell death. Neuroinflammation can occur acutely after surgical trauma and contributes to the development of perioperative neurocognitive disorders, which are characterized by impairment in multiple cognitive domains. In this review, we aim to examine how glutamate handling and glutamatergic function are affected by neuroinflammation and their contribution to cognitive impairment. We will first summarize the current data regarding glutamate in neurotransmission, its receptors, and their regulation and trafficking. We will then examine the impact of inflammation on glutamate handling and neurotransmission, focusing on changes in glial cells and the effect of cytokines. Finally, we will discuss these changes in the context of perioperative neuroinflammation and the implications they have for perioperative neurocognitive disorders.",-1
Reconstructing unseen transmission events to infer dengue dynamics from viral sequences,"For most pathogens, transmission is driven by interactions between the behaviours of infectious individuals, the behaviours of the wider population, the local environment, and immunity. Phylogeographic approaches are currently unable to disentangle the relative effects of these competing factors. We develop a spatiotemporally structured phylogenetic framework that addresses these limitations by considering individual transmission events, reconstructed across spatial scales. We apply it to geocoded dengue virus sequences from Thailand (N = 726 over 18 years). We find infected individuals spend 96% of their time in their home community compared to 76% for the susceptible population (mainly children) and 42% for adults. Dynamic pockets of local immunity make transmission more likely in places with high heterotypic immunity and less likely where high homotypic immunity exists. Age-dependent mixing of individuals and vector distributions are not important in determining spread. This approach provides previously unknown insights into one of the most complex disease systems known and will be applicable to other pathogens.",-1
Ageing without dementia: can stimulating psychosocial and lifestyle experiences make a difference?,"In a world with an ageing population, dementia has become an urgent threat to global health and wellbeing. Psychosocial and lifestyle factors, such as higher socioeconomic positions, longer times spent in education, greater occupational complexity, reduced stress at work, and engagement in mental, physical, and social activities, have been hypothesised to supply resilience against dementia. Although questions remain surrounding the role of these factors in the development of dementia, scientific advancements have considerably expanded our understanding of modifiable psychosocial and lifestyle factors and their neuroprotective and compensatory influences over a life course. Evidence from observational studies is robust enough to suggest that stimulating psychosocial and lifestyle factors are protective against dementia. And, although the corresponding evidence from intervention studies is still scarce, public health campaigns promoting psychosocial and lifestyle factors might improve the health and wellbeing of people aged 60 years and older.",-1
"Naphthoquinone derivatives as P-glycoprotein inducers in inflammatory bowel disease: 2D monolayers, 3D spheroids, and in vivo models","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by an overreaction of immune responses and damage at the intestinal mucosal barrier. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays a key role to protect the intestinal barrier from xenobiotic accumulation and suppressing excessive immune responses. Therefore, induction/activation of P-gp function could serve as a novel therapeutic target to treat IBD. This study aimed to evaluate the potential therapeutic values of naphthoquinone derivatives (NQ-1 - NQ-8) as P-gp modulators to counterbalance intestinal inflammation. The data indicate that NQ-2, NQ-3, and NQ-4 act as P-gp inducers/activators and are recognized as substrates for P-gp. The three derivatives possess anti-inflammatory effects mediated by suppression of NF-ÎºB and HDAC6 activity in Caco2 monolayer cells. Besides, they reversed LPS-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction by enhancing the expression of P-gp and ZO-1 tight junction proteins in a Caco-2 spheroid model. NQ-2, NQ-3, and NQ-4 showed a robust inhibitory effect on IL-1Î² maturation in LPS-primed THP-1 cells. This effect may contribute to alleviate the inflammatory cascades associated with IBD. Distinctively, NQ-2 and NQ-3 exerted anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activity evidenced by the inhibition of CASP-1 activity and the promotion of autophagy. Both compounds induced disruptions of the microtubule network in transfected U2OS-GFP-Î±-tubulin cells. Treatment with NQ-2 remarkably attenuated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats by suppressing changes in colon length, colon mass index, and intestinal histopathology scores. Thus, 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives such as NQ-2 may provide potential therapeutic anti-inflammatory effects for IBD patients and for other NLRP3-associated inflammatory diseases.",-1
English Text Recognition Deep Learning Framework to Automatically Identify Fake News,"Fake news spreading rapidly worldwide is considered one of the most severe problems of modern technology that needs to be addressed immediately. The remarkable increase in the use of social media as a critical source of information combined with the shaking of trust in traditional media, the high speed of digital news dissemination, and the vast amount of information circulating on the Internet have exacerbated the problem of so-called fake news. The present work proves the importance of detecting fake news by taking advantage of the information derived from friendships between users. Specifically, using an innovative deep temporal convolutional network (DTCN) scheme assisted using the tensor factorization non-negative RESCAL method, we take advantage of class-aware rate tables during and not after the factorization process, producing more accurate representations to detect fake news with exceptionally high reliability. In this way, the need to develop automated methods for detecting false information is demonstrated with the primary aim of protecting readers from misinformation.",-1
Effective prediction of soil micronutrients using Additive Gaussian process with RAM augmentation,"In soil chemistry, the nutrients exhibit non-linear and complex relationships owing to their stochastic nature but mostly their similarity is a function of the distance between the data points. The similarity assessment using distance metrics is a popular technique employed by the regression, classification and feature selection algorithms. To enhance the precision of distance metric, the kernel trick is performed on the input space and the similarity is ascertained in the new high dimensional feature space. In Kernel Distance Metric Learning (KDML), the relevance of distance metrics is intensified to capture the precise similarity measure. In Hierarchical Kernel Learning (HKL) and Additive Gaussian Process (AGP) models, several orders of interactions among the subsets of predictors are emphasized while learning the kernel. In this paper a novel method, Restricted Additive Model (RAM) embedded in Additive Gaussian Process (AGP), to compute the distance in input space by adding selective weighted distances from the subset of predictors is proposed. RAM focuses on reusing the information content obtained while preprocessing the data and incorporate it while learning with the kernel. This can save a good amount of computational resources for high dimensional datasets. The proposed model is compared with HKL, AGP and a normal Gaussian Process (GP). The adjusted R2 and the Mean Absolute Error values showed that the proposed model showcased good accuracy reducing the computational time and resources. Further, the comparison of RAM with Automatic Relevance Determination of GP testified that the reusability of the information content turned to be effective in building a parsimonious model.",-1
"Oviposition behavior of wild yellow fever vector mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in an Atlantic Forest fragment, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil","Although there are many studies on the control of mosquito vectors of the yellow fever virus (YFV) in tropical forests, there are still few ecological studies regarding abiotic factors effect on these mosquitoes. Here we characterize these effects on oviposition behavior, abundance, and diversity of mosquito vectors of YFV. The study was conducted in CÃ³rrego da Luz Municipal Park, in Casimiro de Abreu, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, from July 2018 to December 2019. Ovitraps were placed at ground level and 3 m high. The data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by an independent sample analysis, the Mann-Whitney test. The Shannon Diversity Index was used to evaluate the abundance of mosquitos' eggs collected at both ground level and 3 m high. We highlight the presence of Haemagogus janthinomys and Hg. leucocelaenus, primary YFV vectors in forest areas. The abundance of Hg. leucocelaenus (63%), Hg. janthinomys (75%), and Aedes terrens (58%) was higher at the height of 3 m, while Ae. albopictus (52%) was higher at ground level. Aedes albopictus was positively correlated with temperature. Culicidae monitoring is essential for assessing the YFV transmission cycle in Atlantic forest fragments.",-1
Resveratrol Inhibits Metabolism and Affects Blood Platelet Function in Type 2 Diabetes,"Chronic hyperglycemia contributes to vascular complications in diabetes. Resveratrol exerts anti-diabetic and anti-platelet action. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on metabolism and the function of blood platelets under static and in in vitro flow conditions in patients with type 2 diabetes. Blood obtained from 8 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with type 2 diabetes was incubated with resveratrol and perfused over collagen-coated capillaries. Isolated blood platelets were incubated with resveratrol and activated by collagen to assess platelet function, metabolism, ATP release, TXA2 production, lipid peroxidation, and gluthatione content. In the type 2 diabetes group, plasma glucose and fructosamine concentrations were significantly higher than in the healthy group. In in vitro studies, collagen-induced thrombi formation in the blood of diabetic patients was 33% higher than in the healthy group. Resveratrol reduced thrombi by over 50% in the blood of healthy and diabetic patients. TXA2 production was 47% higher in diabetic platelets than in the healthy group. Resveratrol reduced TXA2 release by 38% in healthy platelets and by 79% in diabetic platelets. Resveratrol also reduced the activities of enzymes responsible for glycolysis and oxidative metabolism in the platelets of both groups. These data indicate that the resveratrol-induced inhibition of platelet metabolism and TXA2 release may lead to a reduction of platelet function and thrombus formation in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, resveratrol may be beneficial to prevent vascular complications as a future complementary treatment in aspirin-resistant diabetic patients.",-1
Evolving physicians' perceptions and practices regarding use of SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes during Ramadan fasting,"Objectives:                    We followed up the evolving perceptions and practices regarding use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in Ramadan.              Methods:                    We compared results of the three survey in 2015, 2017, 2019.              Results:                    Senior doctors represented 43.5-66.4% and endocrinologists accounted for 38.1-60.2%. There was a steady reduction in the proportions of respondents who did not know SGLT2-Is at all, who have just heard about the class and those who are quite familiar with the class but have not yet used any. Whereas the proportions of those using the SGLT2-Is class occasionally only was stable. However those who use the SGLT2-Is regularly increased from 11.0% to 45.6% and 62.6%. The respondents' who SGLT2-Is are safe and may be used in all fasting diabetic patients increased from 15.5%, 14.7% to 23.1%. Whereas the view that SGLT2-Is should not be used decreased progressively. Majority of respondents in the three surveys suggested that specific advice is given if they allow the use of SGLT2-Is during Ramadan. More respondents advise taking the medication with the first evening meal than before the last pre-dawn meal and advised to attend to their hydration status. One third of respondents would resume SGLT2-Is immediately after the end of Ramadan; 15% after 1-2 weeks, or prefer to wait till the next medical or educator's clinic visit and others would re-evaluate patients' management plan.              Conclusions:                    The medical professions' knowledge and perceptions regarding the use of SGLT2-Is during Ramadan fasting have evolved over the last few years due to increasing research and experience.",-1
Psychosocial burden and body mass index are associated with dermatology-related quality of life in psoriasis patients,"Background:                    Scientific evidence indicates that inflammatory processes may be involved in the progression of both psoriasis and depression via elevated peripheral proinflammatory cytokines.              Objectives:                    The aim of our study was to assess the association among psychological burden, depressive symptoms and proinflammatory mediators in psoriasis patients.              Materials and methods:                    Forty psoriasis patients were recruited from the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen. In addition to the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), mental and physical health were explored using different questionnaires. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines were analysed.              Results:                    Patients in the high PASI group showed reduced Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), higher body mass index (BMI), elevated CRP levels as well as impaired physical aspects of quality of life. Regression analyses revealed that somatic and anxiety symptoms accounted for more than 32% of the variance in DLQI, independent of PASI and cytokine levels.              Conclusion:                    The data indicate somatic and anxiety symptoms, as well as BMI, to be closely linked to dermatology-related quality of life.",-1
Considering similarity and the rating conversion of neighbors on neural collaborative filtering,"One of the most popular recommender system techniques is collaborative filtering (CF). Nowadays, many researchers apply a neural network with CF, but few focus on the neighbors' concept of CF. This work needs to consider two major issues: the similarity levels between the neighbors and the target user and the user's rating pattern conversion. Because different neighbors have a different influence on the target user and different users usually have a different rating pattern, the ratings directly utilized by the neighbor's preference pattern may be incorrect for the target user. Under two main issues, we try to accomplish three main ideas of CF's prediction: the similarity between users' levels, the neighbor's rating, and the rating conversion. Thus, we propose three main modules, the rating conversion module, the similarity module, and the prediction module, to solve the two issues mentioned above. The rating conversion module projects the neighbor's rating into the target user's aspect. The similarity module uses the users' attentions to compute similarity levels between users. Finally, these similarity levels and the converted ratings are integrated to perform the prediction. The proposed method is compared with the current CF with friends and latent factor model using two types of datasets: real-world and synthetic datasets. We evaluate N neighbors and all neighbors on real-world datasets to prove the number of neighbor is important. Moreover, the performance of the rating conversion module is also evaluated. The proposed method simulates the full rating datasets and the partial rating dataset to compare the effectiveness of using different types of distribution and dataset size. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively outperformed the baselines using ranking evaluation and prediction accuracy on real-world and synthetic datasets. Besides, The effectiveness of using different the number of neighbors depends on the quality of neighbors.",-1
Circulating miRNAs Are Associated with Inflammation Biomarkers in Children with Overweight and Obesity: Results of the I.Family Study,"Increasing data suggest that overnutrition-induced obesity may trigger an inflammatory process in adipose tissue and upturn in the innate immune system. Numerous players have been involved in governing the inflammatory response, including epigenetics. Among epigenetic players, miRNAs are emerging as crucial regulators of immune cell development, immune responses, autoimmunity, and inflammation. In this study, we aimed at identifying the involvement of candidate miRNAs in relation to inflammation-associated biomarkers in a subsample of European children with overweight and obesity participating in the I.Family study. The study sample included individuals with increased adiposity since this condition contributes to the early occurrence of chronic low-grade inflammation. We focused on the acute-phase reagent C-reactive protein (CRP) as the primary outcome and selected cytokines as plausible biomarkers of inflammation. We found that chronic low-grade CRP elevation shows a highly significant association with miR-26b-3p and hsa-miR-576-5p in boys. Furthermore, the association of CRP with hsa-miR-10b-5p and hsa-miR-31-5p is highly significant in girls. We also observed major sex-related associations of candidate miRNAs with selected cytokines. Except for IL-6, a significant association of hsa-miR-26b-3p and hsa-miR-576-5p with TNF-Î±, IL1-Ra, IL-8, and IL-15 levels was found exclusively in boys. The findings of this exploratory study suggest sex differences in the association of circulating miRNAs with inflammatory response biomarkers, and indicate a possible role of miRNAs among the candidate epigenetic mechanisms related to the process of low-grade inflammation in childhood obesity.",-1
New mosquito repellency bioassay for evaluation of repellents and pyrethroids using an attractive blood-feeding device,"Background:                    With the increasing threat of the worldwide spread of mosquito-borne infectious diseases, consumer interest in anti-mosquito textiles that protect against mosquito bites is also increasing. Accordingly, repellent- or insecticide-treated textiles are gaining popularity. The standardization of commercial textile products is, therefore, indispensable for an authentic and objective evaluation of these products. Here we report a textile testing method using an artificial blood-feeding system that does not involve human volunteers or live animals, which aligns with the policy of protecting human and animal welfare.              Methods:                    The attractive blood-feeding device (ABFD) was designed using the HemotekÂ® membrane feeding system. The repellency of DEET, icaridin and permethrin was assayed using unfed female adults of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) under two different test conditions, namely choice and no-choice tests. The choice test consisted of two feeding units, one chemically treated and untreated, that were installed on the ABFD; mosquitoes attracted to and resting on the feeding units were counted and the overall blood-feeding rates recorded. The no-choice test consisted of two feeding units treated with the same chemical that were installed on the ABFD; mosquitoes attracted to and resting on the feeding units were counted and the blood-feeding rates were recorded. A control test was conducted using two feeding units, both sides of which were untreated.              Results:                    In the choice test, high repellency (> 95% inhibition of resting on the treated surface) of 1% DEET and 2% icaridin was observed, whereas 2% permethrin was not an effective repellent. Also, high blood-feeding inhibition (> 95%) was observed for 2% DEET and 2% icaridin. In the no-choice test, high repellency was observed for 1% DEET and 2% icaridin, whereas the repellency of 2% permethrin was low. Also, high blood-feeding inhibition was observed for 2% DEET, 4% icaridin and 2% permethrin.              Conclusions:                    The accuracy and reproducibility of the developed method demonstrate that the ABFD may be widely used for fundamental experiments in the field of mosquito physiology, for the development of new repellent chemicals and in evaluation studies of mosquito repellent products, such as anti-mosquito textiles. The further development of the membrane and feeding unit systems will enable a more practical evaluation of mosquito repellents and blood-feeding inhibitors, such as pyrethroids.",-1
The PINK1 advantage: recycling mitochondria in times of trouble?,"Parkinson disease remains a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, despite the discovery of multiple causative genes that account for familial forms. Prominent among these are PRKN/Parkin and PINK1, whose protein products participate in mitochondrial turnover, or mitophagy. But our poor understanding of the basic biological mechanisms driven by those genes in neurons limits our ability to target them therapeutically. Here, we summarize our recent findings enabled by a new platform to track individual mitochondria in neurons. Our analysis delineates the steps of PINK1- and PRKN-dependent mitochondrial turnover, including the unexplored fates of mitochondria after fusion with lysosomes. These studies reveal unexpected mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control, which may contribute to the reliance of neurons on PINK1 under conditions of stress.",-1
Part Two: Diabetes Part 2: A Review of Insulin Therapy in Older Patients,"Diabetes mellitus is a common disease state among older people, with type 2 diabetes making up most cases. As the disease progresses, many patients will need to transition to insulin therapy. Pharmacists can play a pivotal role in the care of older people with diabetes by providing recommendations related to insulin therapy. Senior care pharmacists need to be knowledgeable about the pharmacokinetics, dosing, adverse effects, and cost concerns related to insulin therapy.",-1
Review of Metabolomics-Based Biomarker Research for Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD), as the second most common neurodegenerative disease, is seriously affecting the life quality of the elderly. However, there is still a lack of efficient medical methods to diagnosis PD before apparent symptoms occur. In recent years, clinical biomarkers including genetic, imaging, and tissue markers have exhibited remarkable benefits in assisting PD diagnoses. Due to the advantages of high-throughput detection of metabolites and almost non-invasive sample collection, metabolomics research of PD is widely used for diagnostic biomarker discovery. However, there are also a few shortages for those identified biomarkers, such as the scarcity of verifications regarding the sensitivity and specificity. Thus, reviewing the research progress of PD biomarkers based on metabolomics techniques is of great significance for developing PD diagnosis. To comprehensively clarify the progress of current metabolic biomarker studies in PD, we reviewed 20 research articles regarding the discovery and validation of biomarkers for PD diagnosis from three mainstream academic databases (NIH PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Elsevier ScienceDirect). By analyzing those materials, we summarized the metabolic biomarkers identified by those metabolomics studies and discussed the potential approaches used for biomarker verifications. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive and updated overview of PD metabolomics research in the past two decades and particularly discusses the validation of disease biomarkers. We hope those discussions might provide inspiration for PD biomarker discovery and verification in the future.",-1
Gut microbiota mediated the toxicity of high concentration of dietary nitrite in C57BL/6 mice,"Growing evidence indicates that exposure to high levels of nitrite for a prolonged time has adverse health effects. Although gut microbiota is responsible for the transformation of nitrite in the gut, the evidence concerning whether gut microbiota mediates the toxicity of nitrite is still lacking. The present study addressed the long-term effects of dietary nitrite on male C57BL/6 mice and employed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to reveal whether gut microbiota mediated the effects of nitrite. Furthermore, the effect of azoxymethane (AOM) on gut microbiota was detected for mice drinking normal or nitrite-containing water. High nitrite had toxic effects on C57BL/6 mice. Meanwhile, high nitrite induced skin lesions in mice, accompanied with increased serum ALT, colon IL-6, TNF-Î±, and MDA levels, together with decreased serum Cr, colon sIgA, and T-AOC levels. After fecal microbiota was transplanted into the normal mice, the nitrite-regulated gut microbiota could also induce skin lesions, coupled with reduced serum Cr, and increased colon MDA. The high dose of nitrite caused the upregulations of Alistipes, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, which could be transplanted into normal mice through FMT. Inversely, gut microbiota from normal mice reduced the effects of nitrite on serum ALT and Cr, together with colon sIgA and MDA. Gut microbiota from normal mice could also upregulate metabolic genes and downregulate stress genes in the nitrite-treated mice. It might due to the upregulation of Akkermansia and Parabacteroides caused by FMT from normal water-treated mice to nitrite-treated mice. In addition, AOM exhibited to be more toxic to the colon in the nitrite-treated mice in comparison with normal water-treated mice, and it might be due to the expression of Hspa1a and Hspa1b in the colon. Interestingly, gut microbiota was more influenced by AOM in the normal water-treated mice than the nitrite-treated mice. Overall, these data demonstrated that gut microbiota mediated the toxicity of a high concentration of dietary nitrite.",-1
Beyond oneself: the ethics and psychology of awe,"Awe and wonder appear to be powerful emotions that can inform and shape our attitudes toward ourselves and others, especially in relation to the larger meaning and purpose of our lives. What are the psychological underpinnings of these universal emotions? How does awe, for example, relate to self-knowledge, and more generally to understanding the enigmatic contradictions of human nature? Is it possible to cultivate and develop this emotion as an ethical incentive in our relationships with others? Are awe and wonder capable of awakening and engendering moral transformation? Does the emotion of awe lie at the root of the religious impulse in humans? and Is there any room left for a sense of the miraculous in today's increasingly scientific and secular world? Professor of religious studies Lisa Sideris joins psychologists Jennifer Stellar and Piercarlo Valdesolo to explore how awe shapes our perspectives and views on everything from science to morality.",-1
Deep Mining from Omics Data,"Since the advent of high-throughput omics technologies, various molecular data such as genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites have been made widely available to researchers. This has afforded clinicians, bioinformaticians, statisticians, and data scientists the opportunity to apply their innovations in feature mining and predictive modeling to a rich data resource to develop a wide range of generalizable prediction models. What has become apparent over the last 10 years is that researchers have adopted deep neural networks (or ""deep nets"") as their preferred paradigm of choice for complex data modeling due to the superiority of performance over more traditional statistical machine learning approaches, such as support vector machines. A key stumbling block, however, is that deep nets inherently lack transparency and are considered to be a ""black box"" approach. This naturally makes it very difficult for clinicians and other stakeholders to trust their deep learning models even though the model predictions appear to be highly accurate. In this chapter, we therefore provide a detailed summary of the deep net architectures typically used in omics research, together with a comprehensive summary of the notable ""deep feature mining"" techniques researchers have applied to open up this black box and provide some insights into the salient input features and why these models behave as they do. We group these techniques into the following three categories: (a) hidden layer visualization and interpretation; (b) input feature importance and impact evaluation; and (c) output layer gradient analysis. While we find that omics researchers have made some considerable gains in opening up the black box through interpretation of the hidden layer weights and node activations to identify salient input features, we highlight other approaches for omics researchers, such as employing deconvolutional network-based approaches and development of bespoke attribute impact measures to enable researchers to better understand the relationships between the input data and hidden layer representations formed and thus the output behavior of their deep nets.",-1
Ammonium transporter AcAmt mutagenesis uncovers reproductive and physiological defects without impacting olfactory responses to ammonia in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii,"Anopheline mosquitoes are the sole vectors of malaria and rely on olfactory cues for host seeking in which ammonia derived from human sweat plays an essential role. To investigate the function of the Anopheles coluzzii ammonium transporter (AcAmt) in the mosquito olfactory system, we generated an AcAmt null mutant line using CRISPR/Cas9. AcAmt-/- mutants displayed a series of novel phenotypes compared with wild-type mosquitoes including significantly lower insemination rates during mating and increased mortality during eclosion. Furthermore, AcAmt-/- males showed significantly lower sugar consumption while AcAmt-/- females and pupae displayed significantly higher ammonia levels than their wild-type counterparts. Surprisingly, in contrast to previous studies in Drosophila that revealed that the mutation of the ammonium transporter (DmAmt) induces a dramatic reduction of ammonia responses in antennal coeloconic sensilla, no significant differences were observed across a range of peripheral sensory neuron responses to ammonia and other odorants between wild-type and AcAmt-/- females. These data support the existence in mosquitoes of novel compensatory ammonia-sensing mechanisms that are likely to have evolved as a result of the importance of ammonia in host-seeking and other behaviors.",-1
iGRLCDA: identifying circRNA-disease association based on graph representation learning,"While the technologies of ribonucleic acid-sequence (RNA-seq) and transcript assembly analysis have continued to improve, a novel topology of RNA transcript was uncovered in the last decade and is called circular RNA (circRNA). Recently, researchers have revealed that they compete with messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding for combining with microRNA in gene regulation. Therefore, circRNA was assumed to be associated with complex disease and discovering the relationship between them would contribute to medical research. However, the work of identifying the association between circRNA and disease in vitro takes a long time and usually without direction. During these years, more and more associations were verified by experiments. Hence, we proposed a computational method named identifying circRNA-disease association based on graph representation learning (iGRLCDA) for the prediction of the potential association of circRNA and disease, which utilized a deep learning model of graph convolution network (GCN) and graph factorization (GF). In detail, iGRLCDA first derived the hidden feature of known associations between circRNA and disease using the Gaussian interaction profile (GIP) kernel combined with disease semantic information to form a numeric descriptor. After that, it further used the deep learning model of GCN and GF to extract hidden features from the descriptor. Finally, the random forest classifier is introduced to identify the potential circRNA-disease association. The five-fold cross-validation of iGRLCDA shows strong competitiveness in comparison with other excellent prediction models at the gold standard data and achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9289 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.9377. On reviewing the prediction results from the relevant literature, 22 of the top 30 predicted circRNA-disease associations were noted in recent published papers. These exceptional results make us believe that iGRLCDA can provide reliable circRNA-disease associations for medical research and reduce the blindness of wet-lab experiments.",-1
Fasting-mimicking diet plus chemotherapy in breast cancer treatment,A clinical trial published in Nature Communications examined the effect of fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. The overall negative study results highlight the need for ameliorating future trial design and investigating alternative FMD-based therapeutic combinations.,-1
Metabolic Risk Factors Associated with Visceral and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue in a Sex-Specific Manner in Seven-Year-Olds,"Objective:                    This study aimed to investigate how visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volumes were associated with metabolic risk factors in 7-year-old children.              Methods:                    A total of 81 children (52% girls) from a Swedish birth cohort were studied. At 6 years of age, anthropometric data, fasting insulin, glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure were collected on 53 children with normal weight and 28 children with overweight or obesity, and insulin resistance was estimated. At 7 years of age, magnetic resonance imaging quantified VAT and SAT. Sex and regression analyses were conducted.              Results:                    SAT was more strongly associated with metabolic risk factors than VAT. The associations between VAT and metabolic risk factors were stronger in girls (P < 0.05). When VAT was adjusted for birth weight and maternal BMI and education, it accounted for 51% of insulin variance (Î² = 11.72; P = 0.001) but only in girls. The key finding of this study was that adjusted SAT accounted for 63% of the fasting insulin variance in girls (Î² = 2.76; P < 0.001). Waist circumference was the best anthropometric marker for insulin resistance.              Conclusions:                    Insulin resistance was associated with abdominal adipose tissue and its associated metabolic risk factors in children as young as 7 years old.",-1
Diversity of Culturable Bacteria Isolated From the Feces of Wild Anopheles darlingi (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes From the Brazilian Amazon,"Microorganisms living in the midgut of Anopheles mosquitoes have been studied to fight vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. Studies on the microbiota of the Neotropical Anopheles darlingi, the most important Brazilian vector for malaria, have been reported for the same purpose. Our aims were to isolate and identify culturable bacteria from An. darlingi mosquito guts through their feces and to estimate the species richness and the frequency distribution of the sampled bacteria. Sixty wild females of An. darlingi mosquitoes were captured at two rural locations, near Porto Velho, RondÃ´nia, Brazil. Bacteria were isolated from mosquito feces, which were collected using cages which permit the collection of feces on LB nutrient agar plates. Sixty bacterial colonies were isolated and stored in glycerol at -80Â°C. Bacteria were identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene obtained using PCR and Sanger sequencing. To aid in species identification, MALDI-TOF, VITEK2, and BBL Crystal were used as complementary protocols. The sequences obtained from the 60 bacterial isolates were compared to sequences deposited in GenBank (NCBI) using BLAST. Homology greater than 97% between the query and the subject was used as the criteria for assigning the identity of each isolate. Fourteen species from eight different genera were identified among the 60 isolates. The most frequent species were Serratia liquefaciens (20%) and Serratia marcescens (15%). Due to their established apathogenicity and according to previous studies, we suggest Serratia and Pantoea species as suitable for paratransgenesis development to fight malaria in Brazilian Amazon.",-1
Leveraging machine learning tools and algorithms for analysis of fruit fly morphometrics,"Analysis of landmark-based morphometric measurements taken on body parts of insects have been a useful taxonomic approach alongside DNA barcoding in insect identification. Statistical analysis of morphometrics have largely been dominated by traditional methods and approaches such as principal component analysis (PCA), canonical variate analysis (CVA) and discriminant analysis (DA). However, advancement in computing power creates a paradigm shift to apply modern tools such as machine learning. Herein, we assess the predictive performance of four machine learning classifiers; K-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (the linear, polynomial and radial kernel SVMs) and artificial neural network (ANNs) on fruit fly morphometrics that were previously analysed using PCA and CVA. KNN and RF performed poorly with overall model accuracy lower than ""no-information rate"" (NIR) (p value > 0.1). The SVM models had a predictive accuracy of > 95%, significantly higher than NIR (p < 0.001), Kappa > 0.78 and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics was > 0.91; while ANN model had a predictive accuracy of 96%, significantly higher than NIR, Kappa of 0.83 and AUC was 0.98. Wing veins 2, 3, 8, 10, 14 and tibia length were of higher importance than other variables based on both SVM and ANN models. We conclude that SVM and ANN models could be used to discriminate fruit fly species based on wing vein and tibia length measurements or any other morphologically similar pest taxa. These algorithms could be used as candidates for developing an integrated and smart application software for insect discrimination and identification. Variable importance analysis results in this study would be useful for future studies for deciding what must be measured.",-1
High-Resolution Computer Tomography Image Features of Lungs for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes under the Faster-Region Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm,"The objective of this study was to adopt the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) technology based on the faster-region recurrent convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) algorithm to evaluate the lung infection in patients with type 2 diabetes, so as to analyze the application value of imaging features in the assessment of pulmonary disease in type 2 diabetes. In this study, 176 patients with type 2 diabetes were selected as the research objects, and they were divided into different groups based on gender, course of disease, age, glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c), 2 h C peptide (2 h C-P) after meal, fasting C peptide (FC-P), and complications. The research objects were performed with HRCT scan, and the Faster-RCNN algorithm model was built to obtain the imaging features. The relationships between HRCT imaging features and 2 h C-P, FC-P, HbA1c, gender, course of disease, age, and complications were analyzed comprehensively. The results showed that there were no significant differences in HRCT scores between male and female patients, patients of various ages, and patients with different HbA1c contents (P > 0.05). As the course of disease and complications increased, HRCT scores of patients increased obviously (P < 0.05). The HRCT score decreased dramatically with the increase in the contents of 2 h C-P and FC-P after the meal (P < 0.05). In addition, the results of the Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that the course of disease and complications were positively correlated with the HRCT scores, while the 2 h C-P and FC-P levels after meal were negatively correlated with the HRCT scores. The receiver operating curve (ROC) showed that the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of HRCT imaging based on Faster-RCNN algorithm were 90.12%, 90.43%, and 83.64%, respectively, in diagnosing lung infection of patients with type 2 diabetes. In summary, the HRCT imaging features based on the Faster-RCNN algorithm can provide effective reference information for the diagnosis and condition assessment of lung infection in patients with type 2 diabetes.",-1
Extended Lymphadenectomy for Proximal Transverse Colon Cancer: Is There a Place for Standardization?,"Background and Objectives: Complete mesocolon excision and high vascular ligation have become a standard procedure in the treatment of colon cancer. The transverse colon has certain embryological and anatomical particularities which require special attention in case of oncological surgeries. Proximal transverse colon cancer (TCC) can metastasize to the lymph nodes in the gastrocolic ligament. The aim of this study is to assess the tumor involvement of these lymph nodes and to determine the applicability of gastrocolic ligament lymph nodes dissection as the standard approach for proximal transverse colon cancer. Materials and Methods: this study analyzes the cases of patients admitted to the Surgery Department, diagnosed with proximal transverse colon cancer, with tumor invasion â?T2 and for which complete mesocolon excision with high vascular ligation and lymphadenectomy of the gastrocolic ligament (No. 204, 206, 214v) were performed. Results: A total of 43 cases operated during 2015-2020 were included in the study. The median total number of retrieved central lymph nodes was 23 (range, 12-38), that had tumor involvement in 22 cases (51.2%). Gastrocolic ligament tumor involvement was found in 5 cases (11.6%). The median operation time was 180 min, while the median blood loss was 115 mL (range 0-210). The median time of hospitalization was 6 days (range, 5-11). Grade IIIA in the Clavien-Dindo classification was noticed in 3 patients, with no mortality. Upon Kaplan-Meier analysis, tumors &gt; T3 (p &lt; 0.016) and lymph node ratio &lt; 0.05 (p &lt; 0.025) were statistically significant. Conclusions: lymph node dissection of the gastrocolic ligament in patients with advanced proximal transverse colon cancer may improve the oncological outcome in T3/T4 tumors, and therefore standardization could be feasible.",-1
Dietary rhamnogalacturonan-â?rich extracts of molokhia ameliorate high fat diet-induced obesity and gut dysbiosis,"Obesity is a global health issue associated with increased prevalence of disease and mortality. Molokhia (Corchorus olitorius L.) leaves, used as vegetables in Asia and Africa, comprise abundant water-soluble mucilage polysaccharides. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of molokhia leaf polysaccharide fraction (MPF) on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and gut dysbiosis in mice. A significant decrease was observed in the body weight, adipocyte size, triglyceride serum, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as in the expression of lipid synthesis-related proteins in mice treated with 4 mg/kg of MPF (MPF4). Moreover, the expression of the tight junction protein increased significantly; however, gut permeability and related inflammatory marker levels decreased in the MPF4 group. Furthermore, MPF ameliorated gut dysbiosis, whereas the MPF4 group presented a decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratios and an increased abundance of Akkermansia during exposure to HFD. Our findings reveal that rhamnogalacturonan-â?rich MPF attenuates obesity in mice subjected to HFD by modulating the gut microbiota.",-1
"Community engagement to control dengue and other vector-borne diseases in Alappuzha municipality, Kerala, India","Introduction Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are a serious threat in many Indian states, including Kerala. Community-based decentralized planning and engagement are effective strategies that can make positive behavioral changes to control VBDs. Methods This community-based implementation research was conducted during November 2016 - October 2018 in Alappuzha municipality in Kerala, India. It was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, formative research was conducted to know the community's profile and perceptions and thus to plan and develop an appropriate intervention. Baseline data on some entomological indicators were also collected. These data were used to assess the impact of the intervention by comparing with the post-intervention data. In the second phase, an intervention through the community's engagement was implemented in selected wards. The activities included the formation of community committees and the vector control and source reduction activities with the community engagement and inter-sectoral coordination. Results The intervention resulted in a positive change among the community to engage in vector control activities. These efforts along with inter-sectoral coordination resulted in successfully implementing vector source reduction activities. In both wards, pre- and post-intervention entomological data (house index: 16.7 vs 6.0 and 64.2 vs. 8.6; container index: 24.8 vs. 12.1 and 37.7 vs. 18.1; and Breteau index: 21.3 vs. 7.3 and 47.7 vs. 8.6) revealed a considerable vector source reduction. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest considering and including community engagement in public health policy as the main thrust to control VBDs.",-1
"""Comparison of cardiovascular autonomic activity (heart rate variability and baroreceptor sensitivity) in young healthy females during fasting and hyperglycaemia""","Background and aim:                    The present study compared cardiovascular autonomic activity and reactivity during fasting (FS) and hyperglycemia (HS) states in young healthy females.              Methods:                    This case crossover study was conducted on 30 females recruited by convenient sampling. Blood glucose levels were measured in FS and after oral glucose load i.e., HS. Finger arterial blood pressure (BP) and ECG were recorded constantly to monitor baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). Autonomic reactivity was tested with deep breathing (DB), Valsalva manoeuvre (VM), and head-up-tilt (HUT) test under FS and HS. HRV parameters not normally distributed were natural log (ln) transformed.              Results:                    Significantly reduced Valsalva ratio and higher heart rate and BP were observed in HS that continued during HUT (P < 0.05). The lnSDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and lnRMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in HS during HUT. After HUT, lnRMSSD remained lower (P = 0.031), whereas lnLF/HF (low frequency/high frequency power) ratio (P = 0.042) and LFnu (normalized units) (P = 0.024) were higher in HS. BRS was significantly lower in supine position in HS compared to FS and further reduced in HUT position in both FS and HS (P < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    Compared to FS, the HS exhibited heightened sympathetic activity with attenuation of parasympathetic activity and this phenomenon was further accentuated by HUT. BRS was more sensitive indicator of autonomic effects of hyperglycemia in resting state. In addition to standard tests, autonomic reactivity in vulnerable young subjects could be useful to detect autonomic imbalance at an early stage.",-1
A Nomogram of Lateral Abdominal Wall Fat Thickness in Normal Third Trimester Fetuses,"Objectives:                    The objective of this study is to establish a nomogram of fetal abdominal wall fat thickness in fetuses with known normal neonatal outcomes.              Methods:                    After IRB approval (HSD-49496), 157 ultrasound examinations in 100 patients, 41 of whom had multiple examinations during the same pregnancy were reviewed. The thickness of the fetal lateral abdominal wall fat Interreader agreement was summarized using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Fat thickness growth curve equations were estimated to quantify the relationship between fat thickness and gestational age.              Results:                    The abdominal wall fat had an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.90-0.96) for 2 readers. Fat thickness increased in all 41 fetuses with multiple examinations (P < 0.001). Fat thickness increased 0.19 mm per week on average (95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.21 mm; P < 0.001) from an average of 1.7 mm at 22 weeks and 4.3 mm at 36 weeks.              Conclusions:                    Lateral wall abdominal fat can be reproducibly measured with good inter observer correlation, and fat does increase with increasing gestational age in normal fetuses. We believe the utility of fetal fat is the documentation of its presence as a reassuring finding indicative of normal fetal health, particularly when prior dating is discrepant or not available during the third trimester.",-1
Intermittent fasting as a nutrition approach against obesity and metabolic disease,"Purpose of review:                    Intermittent fasting has been proposed as a potential nutrition approach against obesity and metabolic disease. Although data from studies in rodents convincingly support the antiobesity and cardiometabolic benefits of intermittent fasting, its effects in human health are still debatable.              Recent findings:                    Recent studies have examined the effect of two intermittent fasting approaches, that is, alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted eating (TRE), on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. ADF seems to be an equally effective weight loss approach to caloric restriction, but adherence to ADF is more challenging. ADF improves cardiometabolic risk factors, whereas it may have superior metabolic benefits compared to caloric restriction in people with insulin resistance. TRE with ad libitum food intake is well tolerated and induces 2-4% weight loss in approximatively 3 months. Additionally, TRE may have metabolic benefits particularly in people with metabolically abnormal obesity even without weight loss.              Summary:                    Intermittent fasting is a promising nutritional approach against obesity and its related metabolic diseases. Further research is needed to: i) establish the long-term effectiveness of TRE in weight loss and metabolic health, ii) improve the long-term adherence to ADF and investigate its weight loss independent effects in metabolic health, and iii) determine the mechanisms underlying the potential cardiometabolic benefits of intermittent fasting in humans.",-1
"Entomological and Anthropological Factors Contributing to Persistent Malaria Transmission in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Cameroon","Introduction:                    In order to improve our understanding of the fundamental limits of core interventions and guide efforts based on prioritization and identification of effective/novel interventions with great potentials to interrupt persistent malaria transmission in the context of high vector control coverage, the drivers of persistent disease transmission were investigated in three eco-epidemiological settings; forested areas in Cameroon, coastal area in Kenya and highland areas in Ethiopia.              Methods:                    Mosquitoes were sampled in three eco-epidemiological settings using different entomological sampling techniques and analysed for Plasmodium infection status and blood meal origin in blood-fed specimens. Human behavioural surveys were conducted to assess the knowledge and attitude of the population on malaria and preventive measures, their night activities, and sleeping pattern. The parasitological analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection in the population using rapid diagnostic tests.              Results:                    Despite the diversity in the mosquito fauna, their biting behaviour was found to be closely associated to human behaviour in the three settings. People in Kenya and Ethiopia were found to be more exposed to mosquito bites during the early hours of the evening (18-21h) while it was in the early morning (4-6 am) in Cameroon. Malaria transmission was high in Cameroon compared to Kenya and Ethiopia with over 50% of the infected bites recorded outdoors. The non-users of LLINs were 2.5 to 3 times more likely to be exposed to the risk of acquiring malaria compared to LLINs users. Malaria prevalence was high (42%) in Cameroon, and more than half of the households visited had at least one individual infected with Plasmodium parasites.              Conclusions:                    The study suggests high outdoor malaria transmission occurring in the three sites with however different determinants driving residual malaria transmission in these areas.",-1
Swarm of micro flying robots in the wild,"Aerial robots are widely deployed, but highly cluttered environments such as dense forests remain inaccessible to drones and even more so to swarms of drones. In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds, even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception, localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time. Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities.",-1
A Novel Approach for Feature Selection and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus: Machine Learning Methods,"An active research area where the experts from the medical field are trying to envisage the problem with more accuracy is diabetes prediction. Surveys conducted by WHO have shown a remarkable increase in the diabetic patients. Diabetes generally remains in dormant mode and it boosts the other diseases if patients are diagnosed with some other disease such as damage to the kidney vessels, problems in retina of the eye, and cardiac problem; if unidentified, it can create metabolic disorders and too many complications in the body. The main objective of our study is to draw a comparative study of different classifiers and feature selection methods to predict the diabetes with greater accuracy. In this paper, we have studied multilayer perceptron, decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, and random forest classifiers and few feature selection techniques were applied on the classifiers to detect the diabetes at an early stage. Raw data is subjected to preprocessing techniques, thus removing outliers and imputing missing values by mean and then in the end hyperparameters optimization. Experiments were conducted on PIMA Indians diabetes dataset using Weka 3.9 and the accuracy achieved for multilayer perceptron is 77.60%, for decision trees is 76.07%, for K-nearest neighbour is 78.58%, and for random forest is 79.8%, which is by far the best accuracy for random forest classifier.",-1
Analysis of the Impact of Type 2 Diabetes on the Psychosocial Functioning and Quality of Life of Perimenopausal Women,"Menopause is a natural period resulting from the decrease in hormonal activity of the ovaries. Growing hormonal deficiencies and changes in the body influence a variety of functions in women, leading to depression and decreased quality of life. The relationship between body composition, the severity of depressive and climacteric symptoms and the quality of life of women with type 2 diabetes and healthy women in the perimenopausal period was studied. Statistically significant differences were observed between the study and control groups regarding all body composition parameters except for protein and the content of torso soft tissues (p < 0.05). In both the study and control groups, resulting symptoms were significantly correlated with numerous body composition parameters (e.g., body mass, fat tissue mass, minerals, abdominal circumference), while symptoms of depression were significantly correlated with similar parameters only in the control group. A statistically relevant relationship was observed between the study and control groups with respect to quality of life in certain domains. The quality of life of women suffering from type 2 diabetes was worse compared with healthy women. Analysis of body composition showed significant differences between healthy women and those with type 2 diabetes.

Decrease in LINC00963 attenuates the progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension via microRNA-328-3p/profilin 1 axis,"Background:                    Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe cardiopulmonary disease characterized by vascular hyperplasia and remodeling. Long noncoding RNA LINC00963 can regulate cell proliferation and metastasis in nonsmall cell lung cancer. However, the function of LINC00963 on PAH progression is rarely reported.              Methods:                    Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the expression levels of LINC00963, microRNA (miRNA)-328-3p, and profilin 1 (PFN1), as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-Î±. The protein level of PFN1 was measured by western blotting. The viability and migration of hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-h-tetrazolium bromide, and transwell assays, respectively. The target relationships between miR-328-3p and LINC00963/PFN1 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. A PAH mouse model was conducted to explore the effects of hypoxia on cardiopulmonary functions.              Results:                    In hypoxia-induced PASMCs and PAH mouse model, high expression levels of LINC00963 and PFN1, and low expression of miR-328-3p, were determined. The viability, migration of hypoxia-induced PASMCs, the expression of VEGF, FGF-2, and HIF-Î± were significantly repressed by transfection of si-LINC00963 or miR-328-3p mimics. The inhibitory effects of LINC00963 silencing on cell viability, migration, and the levels of VEGF, FGF-2, and HIF-Î± were partly eliminated by miR-328-3p inhibitor or increasing the expression of PFN1. Hypoxia treatment increased the levels of RVSP, mPAP, and RV/(LV+S), as well as the thickness of pulmonary artery wall.              Conclusions:                    Silencing of LINC00963 ameliorates PAH via modulating miR-328-3p/PFN1.",-1
Relationship between the gut microbiota and temperament in children 1-2 years old in Chinese birth cohort,"Background:                    Understanding the relationship between the gut microbiota and temperament can provide new insights for the regulation of behavioral intervention in children, which is still lacking research. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the gut microbiota and temperament in a cohort of children in 1 year and 2 years old.              Methods:                    This study included a total of 37 children with completed information, in which 51 samples at age 1 and 41 samples at age 2 were received respectively. We collected birth and demographic information. Parents reported their child's temperament characteristics using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-revised (IBQ-R) and Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ). Fecal samples were collected from each child at 1 and 2 years old and sequenced with MiSeq sequencer. Multiple linear regressions and linear mixed effect models were used to analyze the relationship between the temperament and their microbiota composition as well as the diversity and effect of gender or age on this relationship.              Results:                    At age of year 2, Faecalibacterium was negatively associated with high-intensity pleasure and surgency. Bifidobacterium was negatively correlated with Perceptual sensitivity. Results showed no difference about three domains between year 1 and year 2, while gut microbiota showed diversity difference and genera difference. There was no gender and age difference on the relationship between temperament and the gut microbiota.              Conclusions:                    Temperament was associated with the gut microbiota over time. The temperament remained stable and the relationship between the gut microbiota and temperament wasn't associated with age and gender.",-1

MafA Regulation in Î²-Cells: From Transcriptional to Post-Translational Mechanisms,"Î²-cells are insulin-producing cells in the pancreas that maintain euglycemic conditions. Pancreatic Î²-cell maturity and function are regulated by a variety of transcription factors that enable the adequate expression of the cellular machinery involved in nutrient sensing and commensurate insulin secretion. One of the key factors in this regulation is MAF bZIP transcription factor A (MafA). MafA expression is decreased in type 2 diabetes, contributing to Î²-cell dysfunction and disease progression. The molecular biology underlying MafA is complex, with numerous transcriptional and post-translational regulatory nodes. Understanding these complexities may uncover potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate Î²-cell dysfunction. This article will summarize the role of MafA in normal Î²-cell function and disease, with a special focus on known transcriptional and post-translational regulators of MafA expression.",-1
Towards a Cognitive Science of the Human: Cross-Cultural Approaches and Their Urgency,"While a major aim of cognitive science is to understand human cognition, our conclusions are based on unrepresentative samples of the world's population. A new wave of cross-cultural cognitive science has sought to remedy this with studies that are increasing in scope, scale, and visibility. Here, I review the state of this new wave of research. The portrait of human cognition that emerges is one of variations on a theme, with species-typical capacities shaped by culture and individual experience. The new wave has expanded our understanding of processes underlying human variation and cumulative cultural change, including mechanisms of social learning and cultural transmission. Less consensus has been reached, however, on the cognitive foundations of human nature. The promise of cross-cultural cognitive science will not be fully realized unless we continue to be more inclusive of the world's populations and strive for a more complete cognitive portrait of our species.",-1
Metabolomics study on liver of db/db mice treated with curcumin using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS,"A metabolomics method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was applied to study the metabolic changes of liver in db/db mice administered with curcumin. After one week of acclimating to feeding, 20 db/db mice were randomly divided into two groups: curcumin non-treatment group and curcumin treatment group. After eight weeks of treatment, plasma and liver were collected for biochemical analysis and metabolomics analysis, as well as liver oxidative stress and histopathology examination. Serum biochemical indicators such as blood glucose, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and aspartate aminotransferase decreased significantly in the curcumin treatment group compared to the curcumin non-treatment group, whereas hepatic pathological levels and antioxidation levels improved. There were several different potential biomarkers in two groups, including sphingomyelin (SM) (d18:0/20:0), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (22n-6) (DPAn-6), arachidonic acid (AA), dihomo-gamma- linolenic acid (DGLA), leukotriene C4 (LTC4), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE) (16:1(9Z)/0:0), LysoPE (18:1(9Z)/0:0), LysoPE (0:0/18:0), LysoPE (0:0/20:1(11Z)), LysoPE (20:1(11Z)/0:0), 3-sulfinoalanine, alpha-tocotrienol (Î±-T3) and pantetheine 4'-phosphate (4'-PP). The mechanism might be related to biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic acid metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. The effects of curcumin on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include antioxidant, delaying development of T2DM, preventing Î²-cell death, decreasing insulin resistance, alleviating hepatic damage, and improving metabolic disturbances. Our results provide novel insights and ideas for prevention and treatment of curcumin on T2DM and its complications.",-1
Association of the Kynurenine Pathway of Tryptophan Metabolism With Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Related Gut Microbiota Alterations and Visceral Adipose Tissue Accumulation,"Background:                    The aim of the study was to investigate the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related gut microbiota changes, alterations in the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism, and visceral adipose tissue in the context of HIV infection.              Methods:                    Three hundred eighty-three people with HIV (PWH) were included from the Copenhagen comorbidity in HIV infection (COCOMO) study. Gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing. Plasma metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured by single-slice computed tomography (CT) scan (4th lumbar vertebra).              Results:                    The HIV-related gut microbiota alterations were associated with lower Trp (Î² -.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to -0.00) and higher Kyn-to-Trp ratio (Î² 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.05), which in turn was associated with higher VAT-to-SAT ratio (Î² 0.50; 95% CI, 0.10-0.90) and larger VAT area (Î² 30.85; 95% CI, 4.43-57.28). In mediation analysis, the Kyn-to-Trp ratio mediated 10% (P = .023) of the association between the VAT-to-SAT ratio and HIV-related gut microbiota.              Conclusions:                    Our data suggest HIV-related gut microbiota compositional changes and gut microbial translocation as potential drivers of high Kyn-to-Trp ratio in PWH. In turn, increased activity in the Kyn pathway of Trp metabolism was associated with larger visceral adipose tissue area. Taken together, our findings suggest a possible role for this pathway in the gut-adipose tissue axis in the context of HIV infection.",-1
Biomimetic Nanosystems for the Synergistic Delivery of miR-144/451a for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Background:                    The miR-144/451a cluster acts as a tumor suppressor in various tumors by synergistically inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).              Aims:                    To achieve the synergistic delivery of the miR-144/451a cluster for OSCC treatment by constructing chitosan nanoparticles (CAs) camouflaged with macrophage membranes.              Study design:                    A cell-culture study.              Methods:                    CAs were prepared using the ionic cross-linking method, and biomimetic nanoparticles coloaded with the miR-144/451a cluster (miR-144-source of macrophage-derived exosomes [MEXO]/CA-miR-451a) were prepared using the uptakeâefflux method. The MEXO was detected by a bicinchoninic acid assay. The as-prepared biomimetic nanoparticles were then characterized to determine their protective effects on microRNAs (miRNAs). Moreover, the influence of the miR-144-MEXO/CA-miR-451a nanoparticles on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCCs was evaluated. Finally, the effects of the biomimetic system on the expression of calcium-binding protein 39 (CAB39) and migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected using the real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.              Results:                    After coating the CAs with MEXO, their particle size increased from 113.1 Â± 3.4 nm to 143.2 Â± 14 nm, and their surface potential decreased from 26.34 Â± 0.4 mV to â?0.3 Â± 1.6 mV. The expression of the MEXO marker protein was also observed on the biomimetic nanoparticlesâ?surface. The system can protect miRNAs from RNase A degradation. Compared with the CAs cotransfected with free miR-144/451a cluster, CAs that are coloaded with miR- 144-MEXO/CA-miR-451a nanoparticles substantially reduced the viability (p < 0.001), migration (p = 0.023), and invasion (p = 0.004) of OSCC. These findings revealed the successful construction of biomimetic nanoparticles coloaded with the miR-144/451a cluster. CAB39 and MIF expression in OSCC treated with miR-144-MEXO/ CA-miR-451a nanoparticles have significantly decreased compared with the miR-144/451a group (p < 0.05). Thus, the nanoparticles can effectively improve the inhibitory effects of the miR-144/451a cluster on OSCC.              Conclusion:                    This study provided a new idea for the application of gene cotransfection to tumor treatment.",-1
"Development, feasibility and acceptability of a self-efficacy-enhancing smartphone application among pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus: single- arm pilot clinical trial","Background:                    There is growing attention to the use of mHealth technologies to promote glycemic control for women with GDM around the world, but research on promoting a change in health behaviors is lacking. This study aimed to document the process of designing, developing, and testing the feasibility and acceptability of the SEESPA.              Methods:                    This single-arm pilot clinical trial study included 15 pregnant women with GDM. Following SEESPA development (e.g., goal setting and action plan, role modeling, motivational messages, mastery of experiences, and tracking healthy behaviors), all participants were provided access to use the SEESPA for 4 weeks. Feasibility outcomes assessed were rates of recruitment, retention rate, success rate of transmitting motivational text messages, rate of participants acknowledging receipt of text messages, and success rate of recording healthy behaviors. Acceptability outcomes were determined by asking open-ended questions through telephone interview at 4-week post-intervention.              Results:                    Fifteen randomly selected women consented to participate in the study, with a 60.0% (n = 9) retention rate at post-trial intervention and 40.0% (n = 6) trial dropout. Two motivational text messages per week were sent to all participants. Of these, 68.1% were acknowledged by the participants. Study participants reported that SEESPA is useful, effective, and they felt satisfied about it. In addition, they brought few suggestions that will be integrated on the final version of the app.              Conclusions:                    and Clinical Relevance. The developed innovative SEESPA is a feasible and acceptable intervention for behavioral modifications among women with GDM, and is ready to be tested in a larger RCT study which is expected to inform the health policymakers to integrate SEESPA with the antenatal health care practice of women with GDM, specifically in developing countries where there is a greater risk of developing GDM complications among mothers and their infants.              Trial registration:                    The study is registered on September 16, 2019 (ACTRN12619001278123p) by the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.",-1
Association between Preoperative hs-crp/Albumin Ratio and Postoperative sirs in Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study,"Objectives:                    Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is one of the severe postoperative complications in elderly patients and seriously affects their prognosis and survival rate. Heretofore, there have been no reliable and accurate methods to predict postoperative SIRS in elderly patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether increased preoperative hs-CRP/albumin ratio (CAR) was associated with postoperative SIRS in elderly population.              Methods:                    The data of patients aged â?65 years who underwent general anesthesia in two centers of Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between January 2015 and September 2020 were retrieved and analyzed. Based on the perioperative dataset, we used the targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) to estimate the association between preoperative CAR and postoperative SIRS in elderly population. Patients' CAR was calculated and divided into two groups (< 0.278 and â?0.278) according to its normal range in our hospital. Adjusted odd ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated respectively. Further sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results.              Results:                    A total of 16141 elderly patients were accessed and 7009 of them were enrolled in the final analysis, and 1674 (23.9%) patients developed SIRS within 3 days after surgery. Compared with non-SIRS patients, patients with SIRS had a significantly longer postoperative hospitalization, higher cost and higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with patients with preoperative CAR < 0.278, we found that CAR â?0.278 had a significantly higher risk for the development of postoperative SIRS after multivariable adjustment [aOR = 1.27; 95% CI (1.21, 1.33)]. The interaction effect of preoperative CAR â?0.278 and SIRS was stronger among patients with the following characteristics: aged â?75 years, male, comorbid with diabetes mellitus and admitted to ICU after surgery, duration of surgery < 120 minutes, underwent cerebral surgery or skin, spine and joint surgery (all P < 0.001). The above results remained robust in the sensitivity analysis.              Conclusions:                    Preoperative CAR â?0.278 was significantly associated with increased risk of postoperative SIRS in elderly patients. Special attention should be paid to elderly patients with a preoperative CAR â?0.278 so as to reduce the incidence of postoperative SIRS.",-1
CircRAPGEF5 Promotes the Proliferation and Metastasis of Lung Adenocarcinoma through the miR-1236-3p/ZEB1 Axis and Serves as a Potential Biomarker,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) is a common malignancy; however, its underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) serve as significant cancer regulators. The overexpression of circRAPGEF5 in LAD tissues and cells indicated that it may be involved in promoting LAD progression. Analysis of 61 LAD tissues revealed that circRAPGEF5 was related to lymph node metastasis. Functionally, circRAPGEF5 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of LAD cells in vitro and promoted LAD cells growth in vivo. Mechanistically, dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed direct interaction of circRAPGEF5, miR-1236-3p, and ZEB1. miR-1236-3p was upregulated and ZEB1 expression reduced after circRAPGEF5 knockdown, and the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LAD cells was inhibited. circRAPGEF5 was significantly overexpressed in LAD cell exosomes, and co-culture experiments showed that exosomal circRAPGEF5 enhanced the metastatic ability of LAD cells. Further experiments found that serum exosomal circRAPGEF5 was overexpressed in LAD; moreover, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of exosomal circRAPGEF5 was superior to that of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Jointly detected serum exosomal circRAPGEF5 and serum CEA had better diagnostic performance than when detected individually. Thus, exosomal circRAPGEF5 could promote the proliferation and metastasis of LAD via the miR-1236-3p/ZEB1 axis and serum exosomal circRAPGEF5 may serve as a promising biomarker for LAD.",-1
Lipopolysaccharide from the Cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. Induces Neutrophil Infiltration and Lung Inflammation,"Glucocorticoid-resistant asthma, which predominates with neutrophils instead of eosinophils, is an increasing health concern. One potential source for the induction of neutrophil-predominant asthma is aerosolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cyanobacteria have recently caused significant tidal blooms, and aerosolized cyanobacterial LPS has been detected near the cyanobacterial overgrowth. We hypothesized that cyanobacterial LPS contributes to lung inflammation by increasing factors that promote lung inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. To test this hypothesis, c57Bl/6 mice were exposed intranasally to LPS from the cyanobacterium member, Geitlerinema sp., in vivo to assess neutrophil infiltration and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from the bronchoalveolar fluid by ELISA. Additionally, we exposed the airway epithelial cell line, A549, to Geitlerinema sp. LPS in vitro to confirm that airway epithelial cells were stimulated by this LPS to increase cytokine production and the expression of the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1. Our data demonstrate that Geitlerinema sp. LPS induces lung neutrophil infiltration, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin (IL)-6, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and Interferongamma as well as the chemokines IL-8 and RANTES. Additionally, we demonstrate that Geitlerinema sp. LPS directly activates airway epithelial cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and the adhesion molecule, Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1), in vitro using the airway epithelial cell line, A549. Based on our findings that use Geitlerinema sp. LPS as a model system, the data indicate that cyanobacteria LPS may contribute to the development of glucocorticoid-resistant asthma seen near water sources that contain high levels of cyanobacteria.",-1
"Long-term exposure to GDNF induces dephosphorylation of Ret, AKT, and ERK1/2, and is ineffective at protecting midbrain dopaminergic neurons in cellular models of Parkinson's disease","Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) promotes differentiation, proliferation, and survival in different cell types, including dopaminergic neurons. Thus, GDNF has been proposed as a promising neuroprotective therapy in Parkinson's disease. Although findings from cellular and animal models of Parkinson's disease were encouraging, results emerging from clinical trials were not as good as expected, probably due to the inappropriate administration protocols. Despite the growing information on GDNF action mechanisms, many aspects of its pharmacological effects are still unclear and data from different studies are still contradictory. Considering that GDNF action mechanisms are mediated by its receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, which activates PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, we aimed to investigate Ret activation and its effect over both signaling pathways in midbrain cell cultures treated with GDNF at different doses (0.3, 1, and 10 ng/ml) and times (15 min, 24 h, 24 h (7 days), and 7 continuous days). The results showed that short-term or acute (15 min, 24 h, and 24 h (7 days)) GDNF treatment in rat midbrain neurons increases Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and the phosphorylation levels of Ret (Tyr 1062), AKT (Ser 473), ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), S6 (Ser 235/236), and GSK3-Î² (Ser 9). However, the phosphorylation level of these kinases, TH expression, and dopamine uptake, decreased below basal levels after long-term or prolonged treatment with 1 and 10 ng/ml GDNF (7 continuous days). Our data suggest that long-term GDNF treatment inactivates the receptor by an unknown mechanism, affecting its neuroprotective capacity against degeneration caused by 6-OHDA or rotenone, while short-term exposure to GDNF promoted dopaminergic cell survival. These findings highlight the need to find new and more effective long-acting therapeutic approaches for disorders in which GDNF plays a beneficial role, including Parkinson's disease. In this regard, it is necessary to propose new GDNF treatment guidelines to regulate and control its long-term expression levels and optimize the clinical use of this trophic factor in patients with Parkinson's disease.",-1
Does fasting during Ramadan influence the therapeutic effect of warfarin?,"What is known and objectives:                    The changes in the therapeutic effect of warfarin during Ramadan fasting are controversial. Hence, we carried out the present study to assess if there are any alterations in the anticoagulation response to warfarin and identify the associated risk factors.              Methods:                    Patients receiving warfarin for at least 1 year were included in the present study. Their demographic details, warfarin doses, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) values and concomitant diseases/drugs were retrieved. The dates of Ramadan periods for the calendar years were obtained, and these periods were considered as Ramadan periods. One month before the start dates of Ramadan was considered as pre-Ramadan, and 1 month later than the last dates was considered as post-Ramadan periods. Warfarin sensitivity index (WSI), PT-INR category and time spent in therapeutic range (TTR) were assessed. National Institute of Clinical Health Excellence (NICE) criteria for anticoagulation status were adhered to where TTR (%) <65 was considered as poor anticoagulation.              Results and discussion:                    One hundred and eighty-three patients were recruited. No significant differences were observed in warfarin doses between the study participants between pre-Ramadan, Ramadan and post-Ramadan periods. Significantly more numbers of PT-INR tests were carried out during Ramadan compared with pre- and post-Ramadan periods. A higher WSI was akin to PT-INR, and lower intra-individual variability was observed in middle-aged and older adults in the post-Ramadan period. Significantly fewer patients had their PT-INR in the therapeutic range and more in the subtherapeutic range during Ramadan periods. Greater proportion of patients had PT-INR in the supratherapeutic range during post-Ramadan periods, particularly the elderly. Although 38.3% had poor anticoagulation status overall, 92.4% met the NICE criteria for poor anticoagulation during the 3 months (pre-Ramadan, Ramadan and post-Ramadan periods).              What is new and conclusion:                    Ramadan fasting influences the therapeutic effect of warfarin in terms of lowered TTR (%), reduced proportion of patients achieving therapeutic PT-INR and increased risk of poor anticoagulation control. Greater caution is required during the post-Ramadan period, particularly in the elderly category as they are more prone for over-anticoagulation and consequently the risk of bleeding.",-1
Antiproliferative Properties of Triterpenoids by ECIS Method-A New Promising Approach in Anticancer Studies?,"Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing is an advanced in vitro impedance measuring system which uses alternating current to determine behavior of cells in physiological conditions. In this study, we used the abovementioned method for checking the anticancer activities of betulin and betulinic acid, which are some of the most commonly found triterpenes in nature. In our experiment, the threshold concentrations of betulin required to elicit antiproliferative effects, verified by MTT and LDH release methods, were 7.8 ÂµM for breast cancer (T47D), 9.5 ÂµM for lung carcinoma (A549), and 21.3 ÂµM for normal epithelial cells (Vero). The ECIS results revealed the great potential of betulin and betulinic acid's antitumor properties and their maintenance of cytotoxic substances to the breast cancer T47D line. Moreover, both substances showed a negligible toxic effect on healthy epithelial cells (Vero). Our investigation showed that the ECIS method is a proper alternative to the currently used assay for testing in vitro anticancer activity of compounds, and that it should thus be introduced in cellular routine research. It is also a valuable tool for live-monitoring changes in the morphology and physiology of cells, which translates into the accurate development of anticancer therapies.",-1
3Î²-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expressed by gut microbes degrades testosterone and is linked to depression in males,"Testosterone deficiency can lead to depressive symptoms in humans; however, the causes of this deficiency are incompletely understood. Here, we isolated Mycobacterium neoaurum from the fecal samples of testosterone-deficient patients with depression and showed that this strain could degrade testosterone in vitro. Furthermore, gavaging rats with M. neoaurum reduced their serum and brain testosterone levels and induced depression-like behaviors. We identified the gene encoding 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Î²-HSD) as the enzyme causing testosterone degradation. Introducing 3Î²-HSD into Escherichia coli enhanced its ability to degrade testosterone. Gavaging rats with 3Î²-HSD-producing E. coli reduced their serum and brain testosterone levels and caused depression-like behaviors. Finally, compared with 16.67% of participants without depression, 42.99% (46/107) of the fecal samples of patients with depression harbored 3Î²-HSD, and 60.87% (28/46) of these fecal samples expressed 3Î²-HSD. These results suggest that 3Î²-HSD expressed by gut microbes may be associated with depressive symptoms due to testosterone degradation.",-1
The efficacy and safety of massage adjuvant therapy in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background:                    The incidence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is increasing year by year. If patients cannot receive timely and effective treatment, DPN may lead to diabetic foot ulcers or even amputation. This risk factor has been widely concerned around the world. Massage, as a non-invasive physical therapy method, is gradually being applied in the adjuvant treatment of DPN. However, there is no systematic review of the adjuvant treatment of DPN by massage. Our study will explore the effectiveness and safety of massage applied in DPN.              Methods:                    Eight electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Sinomed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, Chongqing VIP Information) will be searched by our computer on February 9, 2022. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of adjuvant massage therapy for DPN was screened. Primary outcome measures: efficiency, nerve conduction velocity. Secondary outcome measures: pain, blood glucose, and incidence of adverse reactions. The quality of the study was evaluated by two researchers using the RCT bias risk assessment tool in the Cochrane review manual Handbook5.4, and meta-analysis was performed by RevMan5.4 software.              Results:                    RCTs will be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of massage adjuvant therapy in DPN.              Conclusion:                    This study will provide evidence-based evidence for the safety and effectiveness of massage adjuvant therapy in DPN.

GraphTGI: an attention-based graph embedding model for predicting TF-target gene interactions,"Motivation:                    Interaction between transcription factor (TF) and its target genes establishes the knowledge foundation for biological researches in transcriptional regulation, the number of which is, however, still limited by biological techniques. Existing computational methods relevant to the prediction of TF-target interactions are mostly proposed for predicting binding sites, rather than directly predicting the interactions. To this end, we propose here a graph attention-based autoencoder model to predict TF-target gene interactions using the information of the known TF-target gene interaction network combined with two sequential and chemical gene characters, considering that the unobserved interactions between transcription factors and target genes can be predicted by learning the pattern of the known ones. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first attempt to solve this problem by learning patterns from the known TF-target gene interaction network.              Results:                    In this paper, we formulate the prediction task of TF-target gene interactions as a link prediction problem on a complex knowledge graph and propose a deep learning model called GraphTGI, which is composed of a graph attention-based encoder and a bilinear decoder. We evaluated the prediction performance of the proposed method on a real dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed model yields outstanding performance with an average AUC value of 0.8864 +/- 0.0057 in the 5-fold cross-validation. It is anticipated that the GraphTGI model can effectively and efficiently predict TF-target gene interactions on a large scale.              Availability:                    Python code and the datasets used in our studies are made available at https://github.com/YanghanWu/GraphTGI.",-1
The effect of a multi-modal boxing exercise program on cognitive locomotor tasks and gait in persons with Parkinson disease,"Background:                    Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease resulting in motor impairments, postural instability, and gait alterations which may result in self-care limitations and loss of mobility reducing quality of life.              Objective:                    This study's purpose was to determine the impact of a community-based boxing program on gait parameters, dual task and backwards walking in individuals with PD.              Methods:                    This study included 26 community dwelling individuals with PD who participated in 12-week boxing classes (1 hour, 2 times a week). The focus was on upper/lower extremity exercises using punching bags, agility drills, and strengthening activities. Pre/post testing was performed for dual task and gait parameters and was analyzed using t-tests.              Results:                    Analysis of the scores indicated participants performed significantly better at post-test compared to pre-test on self-selected walking velocity (P = 0.041), cadence (P = 0.021); backwards walking velocity (P = 0.003), step length (P = 0.022); dual task walking velocity (P = 0.044), step length (P = 0.023), and gait variability index (P = 0.008). No significant differences for fast walking.              Conclusions:                    Multi-modal boxing produced improvements in gait velocity, dual task velocity, step length, and gait variability, as well as backwards walking velocity and step length. These improvements may impact independence with functional mobility and may improve safety but require further studies.",-1
Reporting details of neuroimaging studies on individual traits prediction: A literature survey,"Using machine-learning tools to predict individual phenotypes from neuroimaging data is one of the most promising and hence dynamic fields in systems neuroscience. Here, we perform a literature survey of the rapidly work on phenotype prediction in healthy subjects or general population to sketch out the current state and ongoing developments in terms of data, analysis methods and reporting. Excluding papers on age-prediction and clinical applications, which form a distinct literature, we identified a total 108 papers published since 2007. In these, memory, fluid intelligence and attention were most common phenotypes to be predicted, which resonates with the observation that roughly a quarter of the papers used data from the Human Connectome Project, even though another half recruited their own cohort. Sample size (in terms of training and external test sets) and prediction accuracy (from internal and external validation respectively) did not show significant temporal trends. Prediction accuracy was negatively correlated with sample size of the training set, but not the external test set. While known to be optimistic, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO CV) was the prevalent strategy for model validation (n = 48). Meanwhile, 27 studies used external validation with external test set. Both numbers showed no significant temporal trends. The most popular learning algorithm was connectome-based predictive modeling introduced by the Yale team. Other common learning algorithms were linear regression, relevance vector regression (RVR), support vector regression (SVR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net. Meanwhile, the amount of data from self-recruiting studies (but not studies using open, shared dataset) was positively correlated with internal validation prediction accuracy. At the same time, self-recruiting studies also reported a significantly higher internal validation prediction accuracy than those using open, shared datasets. Data type and participant age did not significantly influence prediction accuracy. Confound control also did not influence prediction accuracy after adjusted for other factors. To conclude, most of the current literature is probably quite optimistic with internal validation using LOO CV. More efforts should be made to encourage the use of external validation with external test sets to further improve generalizability of the models.",-1
Privacy-preserving parallel kNN classification algorithm using index-based filtering in cloud computing,"With the development of cloud computing, interest in database outsourcing has recently increased. In cloud computing, it is necessary to protect the sensitive information of data owners and authorized users. For this, data mining techniques over encrypted data have been studied to protect the original database, user queries and data access patterns. The typical data mining technique is kNN classification which is widely used for data analysis and artificial intelligence. However, existing works do not provide a sufficient level of efficiency for a large amount of encrypted data. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving parallel kNN classification algorithm. To reduce the computation cost for encryption, we propose an improved secure protocol by using an encrypted random value pool. To reduce the query processing time, we not only design a parallel algorithm, but also adopt a garbled circuit. In addition, the security analysis of the proposed algorithm is performed to prove its data protection, query protection, and access pattern protection. Through our performance evaluation, the proposed algorithm shows about 2â?5 times better performance compared with existing algorithms.",-1
Reducing dengue fever cases at the lowest budget: a constrained optimization approach applied to Thailand,"Background:                    With the challenges that dengue fever (DF) presents to healthcare systems and societies, public health officials must determine where best to allocate scarce resources and restricted budgets. Constrained optimization (CO) helps to address some of the acknowledged limitations of conventional health economic analyses and has typically been used to identify the optimal allocation of resources across interventions subject to a variety of constraints.              Methods:                    A dynamic transmission model was developed to predict the number of dengue cases in Thailand at steady state. A CO was then applied to identify the optimal combination of interventions (release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and paediatric vaccination) within the constraints of a fixed budget, set no higher than cost estimates of the current vector control programme, to minimize the number of dengue cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Epidemiological, cost, and effectiveness data were informed by national data and the research literature. The time horizon was 10 years. Scenario analyses examined different disease management and intervention costs, budget constraints, vaccine efficacy, and optimization time horizon.              Results:                    Under base-case budget constraints, the optimal coverage of the two interventions to minimize dengue incidence was predicted to be nearly equal (Wolbachia 50%; paediatric vaccination 49%) with corresponding coverages under lower bound (Wolbachia 54%; paediatric vaccination 10%) and upper bound (Wolbachia 67%; paediatric vaccination 100%) budget ceilings. Scenario analyses indicated that the most impactful situations related to the costs of Wolbachia and paediatric vaccination with decreases/ increases in costs of interventions demonstrating a direct correlation with coverage (increases/ decreases) of the respective control strategies under examination.              Conclusions:                    Determining the best investment strategy for dengue control requires the identification of the optimal mix of interventions to implement in order to maximize public health outcomes, often under fixed budget constraints. A CO model was developed with the objective of minimizing dengue cases (and DALYs lost) over a 10-year time horizon, within the constraints of the estimated budgets for vector control in the absence of vaccination and Wolbachia. The model provides a tool for developing estimates of optimal coverage of combined dengue control strategies that minimize dengue burden at the lowest budget.",-1
[The game of houses in the MÃ©tissages group],"The house is a symbol strongly invested by the children we receive in transcultural devices.

Nitrogen recycling via gut symbionts increases in ground squirrels over the hibernation season,"Hibernation is a mammalian strategy that uses metabolic plasticity to reduce energy demands and enable long-term fasting. Fasting mitigates winter food scarcity but eliminates dietary nitrogen, jeopardizing body protein balance. Here, we reveal gut microbiome-mediated urea nitrogen recycling in hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Ureolytic gut microbes incorporate urea nitrogen into metabolites that are absorbed by the host, with the nitrogen reincorporated into the squirrel's protein pool. Urea nitrogen recycling is greatest after prolonged fasting in late winter, when urea transporter abundance in gut tissue and urease gene abundance in the microbiome are highest. These results reveal a functional role for the gut microbiome during hibernation and suggest mechanisms by which urea nitrogen recycling may contribute to protein balance in other monogastric animals.",-1
Development of LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of Canagliflozin and Metformin in human plasma and its pharmacokinetic application in Indian population under fast and fed conditions,"A novel, selective and sensitive method is developed for simultaneous estimation of canagliflozin and metformin and successfully applied to fast and fed pharmacokinetic studies in healthy Indian volunteers. The current study reports the development, optimization, and validation of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous quantification of canagliflozin and metformin in human plasma using deuterated canagliflozin D4 and metformin D6 as an internal standard (IS). The solid-phase extraction technique was employed where strata X polymeric reverse phase (30 mg-1 cc) SPE cartridges were used for the extraction of analytes and IS from plasma. The ACE 5 C18 column (50 Ã 4.6 mm, 5Âµ) was used to chromatograph the prepared samples. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and 5 mM ammonium trifluoroacetate in water, pH 5 (50:50, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Detection was performed by positive ion Turbo ion spray in Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, monitoring the transitions m/z 461.9 â?m/z 191.1 and m/z 461.9 â?m/z 267.2, for quantification of canagliflozin. The response of canagliflozin fragments m/z 461.9 â?m/z 191.1 and m/z 461.9 â?m/z 267.2 was combined. Also, for metformin transitions were monitored at m/z 130.0 â?m/z 71.1. Full validation of the method was performed according to the United States Food and Drugs Administration (USFDA) guidelines. Linearity was in the range of 24.95-2806.55 ng/mL for canagliflozin and 24.99-3400.72 ng/mL for metformin. The mean extraction recovery of canagliflozin, canagliflozin D4, metformin, and metformin D6 was 77.240, 84.663, 66.747, and 67.449, respectively across four QC levels. This rapid method with the run time of 2.80 min allows the analysis of more than 400 plasma samples per day.",-1
Fitness characteristics of the malaria vector Anopheles funestus during an attempted laboratory colonization,"Background:                    The malaria vector Anopheles funestus is increasingly recognized as a dominant vector of residual transmission in many African settings. Efforts to better understand its biology and control are significantly impeded by the difficulties of colonizing it under laboratory conditions. To identify key bottlenecks in colonization, this study compared the development and fitness characteristics of wild An. funestus from Tanzania (FUTAZ) and their F1 offspring during colonization attempts. The demography and reproductive success of wild FUTAZ offspring were compared to that of individuals from one of the only An. funestus strains that has been successfully colonized (FUMOZ, from Mozambique) under similar laboratory conditions.              Methods:                    Wild An. funestus (FUTAZ) were collected from three Tanzanian villages and maintained inside an insectary at 70-85% RH, 25-27 Â°C and 12 h:12 h photoperiod. Eggs from these females were used to establish three replicate F1 laboratory generations. Larval development, survival, fecundity, mating success, percentage pupation and wing length were measured in the F1 -FUTAZ offspring and compared with wild FUTAZ and FUMOZ mosquitoes.              Results:                    Wild FUTAZ laid fewer eggs (64.1; 95% CI [63.2, 65.0]) than FUMOZ females (76.1; 95% CI [73.3, 79.1]). Survival of F1-FUTAZ larvae under laboratory conditions was low, with an egg-to-pupae conversion rate of only 5.9% compared to 27.4% in FUMOZ. The median lifespan of F1-FUTAZ females (32 days) and males (33 days) was lower than FUMOZ (52 and 49 for females and males respectively). The proportion of female F1-FUTAZ inseminated under laboratory conditions (9%) was considerably lower than either FUMOZ (72%) or wild-caught FUTAZ females (92%). This resulted in nearly zero viable F2-FUTAZ eggs produced. Wild FUTAZ wings appear to be larger compared to the lab reared F1-FUTAZ and FUMOZ.              Conclusions:                    This study indicates that poor larval survival, mating success, low fecundity and shorter survival under laboratory conditions all contribute to difficulties in colonizing of An. funestus. Future studies should focus on enhancing these aspects of An. funestus fitness in the laboratory, with the biggest barrier likely to be poor mating.",-1
Glial Nrf2 signaling mediates the neuroprotection exerted by Gastrodia elata Blume in Lrrk2-G2019S Parkinson's disease,"The most frequent missense mutations in familial Parkinson's disease (PD) occur in the highly conserved LRRK2/PARK8 gene with G2019S mutation. We previously established a fly model of PD carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation that exhibited the parkinsonism-like phenotypes. An herbal medicine, Gastrodia elata Blume (GE), has been reported to have neuroprotective effects in toxin-induced PD models. However, the underpinning molecular mechanisms of GE beneficiary to G2019S-induced PD remain unclear. Here, we show that these G2019S flies treated with water extracts of GE (WGE) and its bioactive compounds, gastrodin and 4-HBA, displayed locomotion improvement and dopaminergic neuron protection. WGE suppressed the accumulation and hyperactivation of G2019S proteins in dopaminergic neurons and activated the antioxidation and detoxification factor Nrf2 mostly in the astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia. Glial activation of Nrf2 antagonizes G2019S-induced Mad/Smad signaling. Moreover, we treated LRRK2-G2019S transgenic mice with WGE and found that the locomotion declines, the loss of dopaminergic neurons, and the number of hyperactive microglia were restored. WGE also suppressed the hyperactivation of G2019S proteins and regulated the Smad2/3 pathways in the mice brains. We conclude that WGE prevents locomotion defects and the neuronal loss induced by G2019S mutation via glial Nrf2/Mad signaling, unveiling a potential therapeutic avenue for PD.",-1
Hypothesis Test and Confidence Analysis With Wasserstein Distance on General Dimension,"We develop a general framework for statistical inference with the 1-Wasserstein distance. Recently, the Wasserstein distance has attracted considerable attention and has been widely applied to various machine learning tasks because of its excellent properties. However, hypothesis tests and a confidence analysis for it have not been established in a general multivariate setting. This is because the limit distribution of the empirical distribution with the Wasserstein distance is unavailable without strong restriction. To address this problem, in this study, we develop a novel nonasymptotic gaussian approximation for the empirical 1-Wasserstein distance. Using the approximation method, we develop a hypothesis test and confidence analysis for the empirical 1-Wasserstein distance. We also provide a theoretical guarantee and an efficient algorithm for the proposed approximation. Our experiments validate its performance numerically.",-1

Movement of target organs and anatomical landmarks caused by body position change during urological laparoscopic surgery,"Introduction:                    The aim of our study was to elucidate the impact of patients' physical characteristics on the movement of target organs and anatomical landmarks by comparing supine and lateral CT images.              Methods:                    This study consisted of 55 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery in the lateral position. CT images of the area between the abdomen and pelvis were taken preoperatively with patients in both supine and lateral positions. We measured the moving distance of target organs and anatomical landmarks on the body surface used for access port settings. We investigated which covariates from patients' body composition most affected moving distance in correlation analysis. Then, using multiple linear regression analysis, we examined whether we could predict the movement of target organs and anatomical landmarks solely based on information obtained from supine CT images.              Results:                    The moving distance of both the hilum of the kidney and the outer edge of the rectus abdominis muscle were significantly associated with some physical characteristics. Multiple regression analysis showed that a larger visceral fat area could be a useful index for predicting the movement of the kidney toward the counter side. Lower CT density of back muscles and higher BMI could be useful indexes for predicting the movement of the rectus abdominis muscle.              Conclusion:                    Our results suggested that body composition characteristics obtained from preoperative CT images can help predict the movement of target organs and anatomical landmarks used to determine proper port-site placement for laparoscopic surgery performed with the patient in the lateral position.",-1
Genetic analysis of over half a million people characterises C-reactive protein loci,"Chronic low-grade inflammation is linked to a multitude of chronic diseases. We report the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) on C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, in UK Biobank participants (N = 427,367, European descent) and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium (total N = 575,531 European descent). We identify 266 independent loci, of which 211 are not previously reported. Gene-set analysis highlighted 42 gene sets associated with CRP levels (p â?3.2 Ã10-6) and tissue expression analysis indicated a strong association of CRP related genes with liver and whole blood gene expression. Phenome-wide association study identified 27 clinical outcomes associated with genetically determined CRP and subsequent Mendelian randomisation analyses supported a causal association with schizophrenia, chronic airway obstruction and prostate cancer. Our findings identified genetic loci and functional properties of chronic low-grade inflammation and provided evidence for causal associations with a range of diseases.",-1
Hyperuricemia and diabetes mellitus when occurred together have higher risks than alone on all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease in patients with chronic kidney disease,"Introduction:                    Hyperuricemia and diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with increased mortality risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here we aimed to evaluate the independent and joint risks of these two conditions on mortality and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in CKD-patients.              Methods:                    This retrospective cohort study enrolled 4380 outpatients (with CKD stage 3-5) with mortality and ESKD linkage during a 7-year period (from 2007 to 2013). All-causes mortality and ESKD risks were analyzed by multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (adjusted for age, sex, smoke, previous coronary arterial disease, blood pressure, and medications for hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors).              Results:                    Overall, 40.5% of participants had DM and 66.4% had hyperuricemia. In total, 356 deaths and 932 ESKD events occurred during the 7 years follow-up. With the multivariate analysis, increased risks for all-cause mortality were: hyperuricemia alone, HR = 1.48 (1-2.19); DM alone, and HR = 1.52 (1.02-2.46); DM and hyperuricemia together, HR = 2.12 (1.41-3.19). Similar risks for ESKD were: hyperuricemia alone, HR = 1.34 (1.03-1.73); DM alone, HR = 1.59 (1.15-2.2); DM and hyperuricemia together, HR = 2.46 (1.87-3.22).              Conclusions:                    DM and hyperuricemia are strongly associated with higher all-cause mortality and ESKD risk in patients with CKD stage 3-5. Hyperuricemia is similar to DM in terms of risk for all-cause mortality and ESKD. DM and hyperuricemia when occurred together further increase both risks of all-cause mortality and ESKD.",-1
Investigation of image plane for image reconstruction of objects through diffusers via deep learning,"Significance:                    The imaging of objects hidden in light-scattering media is a vital practical task in a wide range of applications, including biological imaging. Deep-learning-based methods have been used to reconstruct images behind scattering media under complex scattering conditions, but improvements in the quality of the reconstructed images are required.              Aim:                    To investigate the effect of image plane on the accuracy of reconstructed images.              Approach:                    Light reflected from an object passing through glass diffusers is captured by changing the image plane of an optical imaging system. Images are reconstructed by deep learning, and evaluated in terms of structural similarity index measure, classification accuracy of digital images, and training and testing error curves.              Results:                    The reconstruction accuracy was improved for the case in which the diffuser was imaged, compared to the case where the object was imaged. The training and testing error curves show that the loss converged to lower values in fewer epochs when the diffuser was imaged.              Conclusions:                    The proposed approach demonstrates an improvement in the accuracy of the reconstruction of objects hidden through glass diffusers by imaging glass diffuser surfaces, and can be applied to objects at unknown locations in a scattering medium.",-1
Recent Progress in Traditional Chinese Medicines and Their Mechanism in the Treatment of Allergic Rhinitis,"Objective:                    To conduct a systematic review on the mechanism of action and use of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) in allergic rhinitis treatment.              Background:                    Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a type I allergic disease of the immune system induced by immunoglobulin E mediated inflammation and is characterized by sneezing, nasal itching, paroxysmal nasal obstruction, mucosal edema, cough, and rhinorrhea. More than 500 million people have been affected by rhinitis worldwide in the past 20 years, leading to negative effects on health, quality of life, and social relationships. Currently, the trending medicines used in the case of AR include intranasal corticosteroids and oral H1 antihistamines, which are given as combinatorial medicines supplemented with immune therapy. These medications have been found to be very effective in either the short term or long term; however, they have been found to possess some serious side effects. Search Methodology. The information in this article on classical and traditional Chinese medications used to treat AR was derived from original papers and reviews published in Chinese and English language journals. Two Chinese databases (Wanfang and CNKI) and three English databases (Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase) were utilized for data gathering.              Results:                    Traditional Chinese remedies have been identified to influence the production of cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-6, which are key mediators of eosinophilic inflammation, TNF-Î±, which stimulates TH2 cells at the site of inflammation, and NF-ÐºB, which is required for cytokine and IgE antibody production. TCM has also been shown to be successful in lowering histamine levels, preserving histological changes by decreasing the thickness of the lamina propria, and downregulating the expression of Orai1, STIM1, and TRYC1, showing low expression of Ca+2 channel proteins.              Conclusion:                    In this review, we discussed a series of classical, traditional Chinese medications, including Centipeda minima, Scutellaria baicalensis, licorice root (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), and others, as potential antiallergic agents and investigate their in vivo effect upon the production of cytokines and release of histamines for allergic rhinitis treatment.",-1
Gallic Acid Alleviates Gut Dysfunction and Boosts Immune and Antioxidant Activities in Puppies Under Environmental Stress Based on Microbiome-Metabolomics Analysis,"Early-life exposure to environmental stress disrupts the gut barrier and leads to inflammatory responses and changes in gut microbiota composition. Gallic acid (GA), a natural plant polyphenol, has received significant interest for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties that support the maintenance of intestinal health. To assess whether dietary supplementation of GA alleviates environmental stress, a total of 19 puppies were randomly allocated to the following three dietary treatments for 2 weeks: 1) basal diet (control (CON)); 2) basal diet + transportation (TS); and 3) basal diet with the addition of 500 mg/kg of GA + transportation (TS+GA). After a 1-week supplementation period, puppies in the TS and TS+GA groups were transported from a stressful environment to another livable location, and puppies in the CON group were then left in the stressful environment. Results indicated that GA markedly reduced the diarrhea rate in puppies throughout the trial period and caused a moderate decline of serum cortisol and HSP-70 levels after transportation. Also, GA alleviated the oxidative stress and inflammatory response caused by multiple environmental stressors. Meanwhile, puppies fed GA had a higher abundance of fecal Firmicutes and Lactobacillus and lower Proteobacteria, Escherichia-Shigella, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 after transportation. As a result, the TS+GA group had the highest total short-chain fatty acids and acetic acid. Also, the fecal and serum metabolomics analyses revealed that GA markedly reversed the abnormalities of amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism caused by stresses. Finally, Spearman's correlation analysis was carried out to explore the comprehensive microbiota and metabolite relationships. Overall, dietary supplementation of GA alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory response in stressed puppies by causing beneficial shifts on gut microbiota and metabolites that may support gut and host health.",-1
"La Crosse virus spread within the mosquito population in Knox County, TN","In Appalachia, La Crosse virus (LACV) is a leading pediatric arbovirus and public health concern for children under 16 years. LACV is transmitted via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Thus, it is imperative to understand the dynamics of the local vector population in order to assess risk and transmission. Using entomological data collected from Knox County, Tennessee in 2013, we formulate an environmentally-driven system of ordinary differential equations to model mosquito population dynamics over a single season. Further, we include infected compartments to represent LACV transmission within the mosquito population. Findings suggest that the model, with dependence on degree days and accumulated precipitation, can closely describe field data. This model confirms the need to include these environmental variables when planning control strategies.",-1
MiR-140-5p exerts a protective function in pregnancy-induced hypertension via mediating TGF-Î²/Smad signaling pathway,"Animal experiments showed that PIH rats had increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), but decreased litter size, number of viable fetuses, fetal weight, and placental weight. The higher Flt-1 and lower VEGF was observed in PIH rats with elevated TNF-Î± and IL-6 levels and decreased IL-10 levels. Treatment with agomiR-140-5p improved regarding the above indicators. Cell experiments demonstrated that miR-140-5p mimic increased cell invasion and migration abilities and decreased the activity of TGF-Î²/Smad pathway, while TGFBR1 can reverse the role of miR-140-5p mimic in trophoblasts.",-1
Deacetylated-poly-N-acetylglucosamine-folic Acid as a Nanocarrier for Delivering miR-196a Inhibitor to Anticancer Activity,"Background:                    MiR-196a is particularly noticeable in the development of liver cancer. However, the rapid degradation by ribonuclease (RNase) imposes a limit on the miRNA gene therapy applications.              Aims:                    To design a novel gene-targeting nano system for liver cancer treatment.              Study design:                    Cell culture study and animal experimentation.              Methods:                    Deacetylated (DEAC)-poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG)-folic acid (FA) was prepared via ethyl (dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide reaction, and miR-196a inhibitor (miR-196a I)/DEAC-PNAG-FA was prepared through self-assembly. The characterization and nucleic acid protection of the self-assembly system were also determined. The biological function and related mechanism of the prepared system were studied at cellular and molecular levels. Mice were established as a xenotransplantation model to evaluate the anticancer capacity of miR-196a I/DEAC-PNAG-FA in vivo.              Results:                    The morphology of miR-196a I/DEAC-PNAG-FA was uniform, and its particle size was approximately 70-100 nm. A nanocarrier with an N/P ratio of 200:1 can maximize the nucleic acid carrying capacity of the self-assembly system. The nanosystem can protect miRNA from RNase degradation and could be internalized rapidly within 4 h. The self-assembly system significantly enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of miR-196a I on HepG2 cells (P = 0.003). Molecular biological analyses confirmed that the apoptosis-inducing effect of the nanosystem was due to the inhibition of miR-196a gene expression in HepG2 cells, which upregulate the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins FOXO1 (P < 0.001), Bax (P < 0.001), Ki67 (P < 0.001), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (P < 0.001), and inhibit the expression of apoptosis inhibitory protein Bcl-2 (P < 0.001). Moreover, compared with free miR-196a inhibitor or miR-196a I/DEAC-PNAG, miR-196a I/DEAC-PNAG-FA can more effectively inhibit tumor growth in vivo (P = 0.026).              Conclusion:                    The newly prepared self-assembly targeting system can effectively induce apoptosis and abrogate tumor growth, which may open a new approach for liver cancer treatment.",-1
Emotion Analysis Model of Microblog Comment Text Based on CNN-BiLSTM,"Aiming at the problems of over reliance on labor and low generalization of traditional emotion analysis methods based on dictionary and machine learning, an emotion analysis model of microblog comment text based on deep learning is proposed. Firstly, text is obtained through microblog crawler program. After data preprocessing, including data cleaning, Chinese word segmentation, removal of stop words, and so on, the Skip-gram model is used for word vector training on a large-scale unmarked corpus, and then the trained word vector is used as the text input of CNN-BiLSTM model, which combines Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). Considering the historical context information and the subsequent context information, BiLSTM can better use the temporal relationship of text to learn sentence semantics. CNN can extract hidden features from the text and combine them. Finally, after Adamax optimization training, the emotion type of microblog comment text is output. The proposed model combines the learning advantages of BiLSTM and CNN. The overall accuracy of text emotion analysis has been greatly improved, with an accuracy of 0.94 and an improvement of 8.51% compared with the single CNN model.",-1
Thinking through prior bodies: autonomic uncertainty and interoceptive self-inference,"The Bayesian brain hypothesis, as formalized by the free-energy principle, is ascendant in cognitive science. But, how does the Bayesian brain obtain prior beliefs? VeissiÃ¨re and colleagues argue that sociocultural interaction is one important source. We offer a complementary model in which ""interoceptive self-inference"" guides the estimation of expected uncertainty both in ourselves and in our social conspecifics.",-1
Th17 cell plasticity towards a T-bet-dependent Th1 phenotype is required for bacterial control in Staphylococcus aureus infection,"Staphylococcus aureus is frequently detected in patients with sepsis and thus represents a major health burden worldwide. CD4+ T helper cells are involved in the immune response to S. aureus by supporting antibody production and phagocytosis. In particular, Th1 and Th17 cells secreting IFN-Î³ and IL-17A, are involved in the control of systemic S. aureus infections in humans and mice. To investigate the role of T cells in severe S. aureus infections, we established a mouse sepsis model in which the kidney was identified to be the organ with the highest bacterial load and abundance of Th17 cells. In this model, IL-17A but not IFN-Î³ was required for bacterial control. Using Il17aCre Ã R26YFP mice we could show that Th17 fate cells produce Th17 and Th1 cytokines, indicating a high degree of Th17 cell plasticity. Single cell RNA-sequencing of renal Th17 fate cells uncovered their heterogeneity and identified a cluster with a Th1 expression profile within the Th17 cell population, which was absent in mice with T-bet/Tbx21-deficiency in Th17 cells (Il17aCre x R26eYFP x Tbx21-flox). Blocking Th17 to Th1 transdifferentiation in Th17 fate cells in these mice resulted in increased S. aureus tissue loads. In summary, we highlight the impact of Th17 cells in controlling systemic S. aureus infections and show that T-bet expression by Th17 cells is required for bacterial clearance. While targeting the Th17 cell immune response is an important therapeutic option in autoimmunity, silencing Th17 cells might have detrimental effects in bacterial infections.",-1
Identification of Metabolically Distinct Adipocyte Progenitor Cells in Human Adipose Tissues,"Adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) provide the reservoir of regenerative cells to produce new adipocytes, although their identity in humans remains elusive. Using FACS analysis, gene expression profiling, and metabolic and proteomic analyses, we identified three APC subtypes in human white adipose tissues. The APC subtypes are molecularly distinct but possess similar proliferative and adipogenic capacities. Adipocytes derived from APCs with high CD34 expression exhibit exceedingly high rates of lipid flux compared with APCs with low or no CD34 expression, while adipocytes produced from CD34- APCs display beige-like adipocyte properties and a unique endocrine profile. APCs were more abundant in gluteofemoral compared with abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues, and the distribution of APC subtypes varies between depots and in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the heterogeneity of human white adipose tissue and a potential basis for dysregulated adipocyte function in type 2 diabetes.",-1
A mobile-assisted voice condition analysis system for Parkinson's disease: assessment of usability conditions,"Background and objective:                    Automatic voice condition analysis systems to detect Parkinson's disease (PD) are generally based on speech data recorded under acoustically controlled conditions and professional supervision. The performance of these approaches in a free-living scenario is unknown. The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of uncontrolled conditions (realistic acoustic environment and lack of supervision) on the performance of automatic PD detection systems based on speech.              Methods:                    A mobile-assisted voice condition analysis system is proposed to aid in the detection of PD using speech. The system is based on a server-client architecture. In the server, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms are designed and implemented to discriminate subjects with PD from healthy ones. The Android app allows patients to submit phonations and physicians to check the complete record of every patient. Six different machine learning classifiers are applied to compare their performance on two different speech databases. One of them is an in-house database (UEX database), collected under professional supervision by using the same Android-based smartphone in the same room, whereas the other one is an age, sex and health-status balanced subset of mPower study for PD, which provides real-world data. By applying identical methodology, single-database experiments have been performed on each database, and also cross-database tests. Cross-validation has been applied to assess generalization performance and hypothesis tests have been used to report statistically significant differences.              Results:                    In the single-database experiments, a best accuracy rate of 0.92 (AUC = 0.98) has been obtained on UEX database, while a considerably lower best accuracy rate of 0.71 (AUC = 0.76) has been achieved using the mPower-based database. The cross-database tests provided very degraded accuracy metrics.              Conclusion:                    The results clearly show the potential of the proposed system as an aid for general practitioners to conduct triage or an additional tool for neurologists to perform diagnosis. However, due to the performance degradation observed using data from mPower study, semi-controlled conditions are encouraged, i.e., voices recorded at home by the patients themselves following a strict recording protocol and control of the information about patients by the medical doctor at charge.",-1
Integrating Behavioral Economic and Social Network Influences in Understanding Alcohol Misuse in a Diverse Sample of Emerging Adults,"Background:                    Behavioral economic alcohol demand is a measure of motivation to consume alcohol and a robust risk factor for alcohol misuse. Social networks that are dense with alcohol are also associated with heavy drinking, but the intersection of these risk factors has not been investigated to date. This study examined these interrelationships with structural equation modeling using cross-sectional data from a diverse community sample of heavy-drinking emerging adults (N = 602).              Methods:                    Latent variables for alcohol social network, alcohol demand, and alcohol misuse were constructed. Next, relations between the latent variables were examined, including the indirect effect of alcohol demand in the relation between alcohol social network and alcohol misuse. An alternative modeling testing the indirect effect of alcohol social network on the relation between alcohol demand and misuse was also tested.              Results:                    When alone in the model, social network alcohol density significantly predicted alcohol misuse. When alcohol demand was included in the model, social network alcohol density predicted alcohol demand, alcohol demand predicted alcohol misuse, and an indirect effect on alcohol misuse through alcohol demand was present. In the alternative model, an indirect effect was not present between alcohol demand and alcohol misuse by social network alcohol density. Exploratory analyses revealed significant sex, race, and college status differences.              Conclusions:                    These results suggest that the influence of social network alcohol density on alcohol misuse may be, in part, through variance accounted for by alcohol reinforcing value. Longitudinal testing of this mechanistic pathway is warranted.",-1
Motile mosquito stage malaria parasites: ready for their close-up,"Many stages of the complex Plasmodium parasite life cycle, the eukaryotic pathogen that causes malaria, are extracellular and motile. This motility is essential for life cycle progression, and two studies in this issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine (Hopp et al, 2021; Ripp et al, 2021) examine the motility of two of these life cycle stages. These are the ookinete, which develops in the midgut of an infected mosquito vector, and the sporozoite, which is injected into the skin of an unsuspecting host by an infected mosquito, initiating the parasite life cycle in the human. Therapeutic targeting of the ookinete and sporozoite (Duffy & Patrick Gorres, 2020), which are profound bottlenecks in the life cycle, has recently received a great deal of attention in our battle to prevent the 400,000 deaths from malaria that occur every year (WHO, 2020).",-1

Reduced biliverdin reductase-A levels are associated with early alterations of insulin signaling in obesity,"Biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BVR-A is a substrate of the insulin receptor and regulates IRS1 by avoiding its aberrant activation, and in animal model of obesity the loss of hepatic BVR-A has been associated with glucose/insulin alterations and fatty liver disease. However, no studies exist in humans. Here, we evaluated BVR-A expression levels and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from obese subjects and matched lean controls and we investigated the related molecular alterations of the insulin along with clinical correlates. We showed that BVR-A levels are significantly reduced in obese subjects and associated with a hyper-activation of the IR/IRS1/Akt/GSK-3Î²/AS160/GLUT4 pathway. Low BVR-A levels also associate with the presence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, NASH and visceral adipose tissue inflammation. These data suggest that the reduction of BVR-A may be responsible for early alterations of the insulin signaling pathway in obesity and in this context may represent a novel molecular target to be investigated for the comprehension of the process of insulin resistance development in obesity.",-1
Crosstalk between bile acid-activated receptors and microbiome in entero-hepatic inflammation,"Bile acids are potent signaling molecules exerting diverse actions through bile acid-activated receptors. Among them, the Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5; GPBAR1), modulate the inflammation occurring in chronic/acute hepatitis, cholestasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. A role for other bile acid-responsive receptors in this context is emerging. This review aims to summarize recent advances on the immune-modulatory actions of the bile acid-responsive receptors Shingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor Î³t (RORÎ³t). How microbiota-derived bile acids contribute to intestinal and hepatic inflammation, potentially through these receptors, is also discussed. These concepts pave the way to novel and innovative strategies aiming at modulating the gut microbiota to tackle inflammatory syndromes.",-1
Water extract of Ferula lehmanni Boiss. prevents high-fat diet-induced overweight and liver injury by modulating the intestinal microbiota in mice,"Obesity, often accompanied by hepatic steatosis, has been associated with an increased risk of health complications such as fatty liver disease and certain cancers. Ferula lehmannii Boiss., a food and medicine homologue, has been used for centuries as a seasoning showing anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant effects on digestive discomfort. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether a short-term oral administration of water extract of Ferula lehmanni Boiss. (WEFL) could prevent high-fat diet (HFD)-induced abnormal weight gain and hepatic steatosis in mice and its underlying mechanisms. WEFL reduced HFD-increased body weight, liver injury markers and inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-6 and IL-1Î²), and inhibited the elevation of AMPKÎ±, SREBP-1c and FAS in HFD. Moreover, WEFL reconstructed the gut microbiota composition by increasing the relative abundances of beneficial bacteria, e.g. Akkermansia spp., while decreasing Desulfovibrio spp. and so on, thereby reversing the detrimental effects of HFD in mice. Removal of the gut microbiota with antibiotics partially eliminated the hepatoprotective effects of WEFL. Notably, WEFL substantially promoted the levels of short-chain fatty acids, especially butyric acid. To clarify the functional components at play in WEFL, we used UPLC-MS/MS to comprehensively detect its substance composition and found it to be a collection of polyphenol-rich compounds. Together, our findings demonstrate that WEFL prevented HFD-induced obesity and liver injury through the hepatic-microbiota axis, and such health-promoting value might be explained by the enriched abundant polyphenols.",-1
Identification of hub genes for adult patients with sepsis via RNA sequencing,"To screen out potential prognostic hub genes for adult patients with sepsis via RNA sequencing and construction of a microRNA-mRNA-PPI network and investigate the localization of these hub genes in peripheral blood monocytes. The peripheral blood of 33 subjects was subjected to microRNA and mRNA sequencing using high-throughput sequencing, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) were identified by bioinformatics. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (10 Ã Genomics) was further conducted. Among the samples from 23 adult septic patients and 10 healthy individuals, 20,391 genes and 1633 microRNAs were detected by RNA sequencing. In total, 1114 preliminary DEGs and 76 DEMs were obtained using DESeq2, and 454 DEGs were ultimately distinguished. A microRNA-mRNA-PPI network was constructed based on the DEGs and the top 20 DEMs, which included 10 upregulated and 10 downregulated microRNAs. Furthermore, the hub genes TLR5, FCGR1A, ELANE, GNLY, IL2RB and TGFBR3, which may be associated with the prognosis of sepsis, and their negatively correlated microRNAs, were analysed. The genes TLR5, FCGR1A and ELANE were mainly expressed in macrophages, and the genes GNLY, IL2RB and TGFBR3 were expressed specifically in T cells and natural killer cells. Parallel analysis of mRNAs and microRNAs in patients with sepsis was demonstrated to be feasible using RNA-seq. Potential hub genes and microRNAs that may be related to sepsis prognosis were identified, providing new prospects for sepsis treatment. However, further experiments are needed.",-1
Intraretinal Cysts as a Manifestation of Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography,"Background and Objectives: Intraretinal cysts are common pathology observed inspectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) in patients with neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The aim of the study was to determine if the presence of intraretinal cysts is positively correlated with diagnosis of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Material and Methods: A total of 21 eyes with intraretinal cysts in SDOCT exam (Group1) and 21 eyes with subretinal fluid(Group 2) were enrolled into the study. In each eye, the presence of intraretinal neovascularization (IRN) and chorioretinal anastomosis (CRA) was evaluated in OCTA by two experienced graders. Results: IRN was observed in 20 eyes (95.2%) from Group 1 and 5 eyes (23.8%) from Group 2. Features of CRA were found in 18 eyes (80.95%) and 16 eyes (76.2%) respectively for Group 1 and 2. Patients with cysts are 50 (95% CI: 5.43-460.52) times more likely to have IRN (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The presence of intraretinal cysts on SDOCT retinal sections in eyes with neovascular AMD corresponds to the presence of IRN on OCTA examination. The results indicate that the absence of a cyst does not exclude the presence of IRN and CRA which can be identified on OCTA.",-1
Identification of Novel Circulating miRNAs in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke,"Ischemic strokes are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but currently there are no reliable prognostic or diagnostic blood biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various molecular pathways and may be used as biomarkers. Using RNA-Seq, we conducted comprehensive circulating miRNA profiling in patients with ischemic stroke compared with healthy controls. Samples were collected within 24 h of clinical diagnosis. Stringent analysis criteria of discovery (46 cases and 95 controls) and validation (47 cases and 96 controls) cohorts led to the identification of 10 differentially regulated miRNAs, including 5 novel miRNAs, with potential diagnostic significance. Hsa-miR-451a was the most significantly upregulated miRNA (FC; 4.8, FDR; 3.78 Ã 10-85), while downregulated miRNAs included hsa-miR-574-5p and hsa-miR-142-3p, among others. Importantly, we computed a multivariate classifier based on the identified miRNA panel to differentiate between ischemic stroke patients and healthy controls, which showed remarkably high sensitivity (0.94) and specificity (0.99). The area under the ROC curve was 0.97 and it is superior to other current available biomarkers. Moreover, in samples collected one month following stroke, we found sustained upregulation of hsa-miR-451a and downregulation of another 5 miRNAs. Lastly, we report 3 miRNAs that were significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes of stroke, as defined by the modified Rankin scores. The clinical translation of the identified miRNA panel may be explored further.",-1
Strain-level fitness in the gut microbiome is an emergent property of glycans and a single metabolite,"The human gut microbiota resides within a diverse chemical environment challenging our ability to understand the forces shaping this ecosystem. Here, we reveal that fitness of the Bacteroidales, the dominant order of bacteria in the human gut, is an emergent property of glycans and one specific metabolite, butyrate. Distinct sugars serve as strain-variable fitness switches activating context-dependent inhibitory functions of butyrate. Differential fitness effects of butyrate within the Bacteroides are mediated by species-level variation in Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity and nucleotide polymorphisms regulating an Acyl-CoA transferase. Using in vivo multi-omic profiles, we demonstrate Bacteroides fitness in the human gut is associated together, but not independently, with Acyl-CoA transferase expression and butyrate. Our data reveal that each strain of the Bacteroides exists within a unique fitness landscape based on the interaction of chemical components unpredictable by the effect of each part alone mediated by flexibility in the core genome.",-1
Interventions Aimed at Reducing Fasting Times in Acute Hospital Patients: A Systematic Literature Review,"Despite current guidelines recommending fasting from solids for â? hours and clear fluids for â? hours prior to surgery, outdated practices endure; patients fast for unnecessarily prolonged periods because of beliefs regarding aspiration risk upon anaesthesia induction. This literature review aimed to identify and evaluate current interventions aiming to reduce preoperative fasting times for acutely ill hospital patients, summarizing effective interventional strategies and associated outcomes. EMBASE, MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, and CINAHL were systematically searched. Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane risk-of-bias tools. Studies, of any type, reporting fasting times as a primary or secondary outcome were included. A total of 1918 potential studies were identified; of these, 16 studies were included. Seven studies investigated the effect of changing fasting protocol on gastric fluid volume/residual gastric volume (GFV/RGV) and gastric pH as surrogate measures for aspiration risk. No significant differences in GFV/RGV and gastric pH due to reduced preoperative fasting were reported, thus no change in aspiration risk. Eight studies documented improvements in patient-reported outcomes with shorter fasting times. However, this review identified a paucity of studies that trialled interventions to reduce fasting times as the primary aim. These interventions were multimodal and multidisciplinary in nature, incorporating principles of implementation science to successfully achieve significant reductions in fasting times. This review highlights that reducing the preoperative fasting period is safe while improving patient's physical and psychological well-being. Further high-quality studies that investigate multimodal interventions, and that utilize implementation science principles, are required in this area.",-1
Induced Hatching of Quiescent Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) Eggs by Labile Glutathione-Stabilizable Compounds From Yeast Extract,"Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) is the insect vector that transmits several deadly human diseases. Although the egg stage is an important phase of its life cycle, the biology of mosquito egg remains poorly understood. Here, we report our investigations on the chemical factors that induced hatching of Ae. aegypti eggs. Commercial yeast extracts were able to increase egg hatching rate in a dose-dependent manner, with a hatching rate that ranged from approximately 10% with 1 g/liter to 80% with 20 g/liter of yeast extract. Notably, the addition of glutathione, a reducing agent that showed no significant effect on egg hatching by itself, enhanced and stabilized the activity of yeast extract for at least 70 h. Because dissolved oxygen in different treatments was maintained at high levels in a narrow range (92-95%), we proposed that yeast extract contains hatching inducing compound (HIC) which is able to trigger egg hatching independent of dissolved oxygen level. The HIC in yeast extract could prove to be a potential starting point to design an effective tool to forcefully induce mosquito eggs to hatch under unfavorable conditions, functioning as a novel method for vector control.",-1
Using simple radiologic measurements to anticipate surgical challenge in endometrial cancer: a prospective study,"Objectives:                    To determine if linear measurements of adiposity from pre-operative imaging can improve anticipation of surgical difficulty among endometrial cancer patients.              Methods:                    Eighty patients with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer were enrolled. Routine pre-operative imaging (MRI or CT) was performed. Radiologic linear measurements of the following were obtained: anterior-to-posterior skin distance; anterior skin to anterior edge of L5 distance (total anterior); anterior peritoneum to anterior edge of L5 distance (visceral obesity); and posterior edge of L5 to posterior skin distance (total posterior). Surgeons completed questionnaires quantifying preoperative anticipated operative difficulty and postoperative reported operative difficulty. The primary objective was to assess for a correlation between linear measurements of visceral fat and reported operative difficulty.              Results:                    Seventy-nine patients had questionnaires completed, preoperative imaging obtained, and surgery performed. Univariate analysis showed all four linear measurements, body mass index, weight, and anticipated operative difficulty were associated with increased reported operative difficulty (P< 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that body mass index and linear measurements visceral obesity and total posterior were independently associated with increased reported operative difficulty (P< 0.05). Compared with body mass index, the visceral obesity measurement was more sensitive and specific for predicting increased reported operative difficulty (visceral obesity; sensitivity 54%, specificity 91 %; body mass index; sensitivity 38%, specificity 89%). A difficulty risk model combining body mass index, visceral obesity, and total posterior demonstrated better predictive performance than any individual preoperative variable.              Conclusions:                    Simple linear measurements of visceral fat obtained from preoperative imaging are more predictive than body mass index alone in anticipating surgeon-reported operative difficulty. These easily obtained measurements may assist in preoperative decision making in this challenging patient population.",-1
Circ_ZFR affects FABP7 expression to regulate breast cancer progression by acting as a sponge for miR-223-3p,"Background:                    Breast cancer (BC) is a common malignancy in women. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to play a key role in the development of BC; however, the effect of circular RNA zinc finger RNA binding protein (circ_ZFR) in BC is unknown.              Methods:                    Abundances of circ_ZFR, fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7), and microRNA-223-3p (miR-223-3p) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The circular structure of circ_ZFR was validated by RNase R treatment. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were assessed by colony formation, cell counting kit-8, Transwell, flow cytometry assays, respectively. All protein levels were determined by Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the relationship between miR-223-3p and circ_ZFR or FABP7. A xenograft model was established to understand the effect of circ_ZFR on BC cell growth in vivo.              Results:                    The expression levels of circ_ZFR and FABP7 were higher in BC tissues and cell lines, whereas miR-223-3p expression was lower. Knockdown of circ_ZFR or FABP7 in BC cells reduced proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and induced apoptosis in vitro, whereas the opposite effects were observed in circ_ZFR-overexpressed cells. Furthermore, circ_ZFR might act as a sponge for miR-223-3p to regulate FABP7 expression, thereby promoting the progression of BC cells in vitro and in vivo.              Conclusion:                    Circ_ZFR might act as a miRNA sponge for miR-223-3p to regulate FABP7, thereby promoting proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of BC cells, and inhibiting cell apoptosis.",-1
"Long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 12/microRNA-138-5p/nuclear factor I/B regulates neuronal apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes tremors, gait rigidity, and hypokinesia. We determined the effects of long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (lncRNA SNHG12) on the development of PD. StarBase analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay verified the interaction between lncRNA SNHG12 and microRNA-138-5p (miR-138-5p). The effects of suppressed lncRNA SNHG12 and increased miR-138-5p levels on mRNA were determined using quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) treated SH-SY5Y cells. Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, apoptosis, cleaved-Caspase3/Caspase3 ratio, inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, decreased cell viability, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were observed in MPP+-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Transfection of the lncRNA SNHG12-plasmid reduced neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in MPP+-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells that were rescued by adding the miR-138-5p mimic. These results showed that lncRNA SNHG12 could affect neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in a PD cell model by regulating miR-138-5p expression. TargetScan and dual-luciferase reporter analysis suggested that miR-138-5p targeted nuclear factor I/B (NFIB). Furthermore, the expression level of NFIB was downregulated after MPP+ stimulation in SH-SY5Y cells. After transfecting with the miR-138-5p inhibitor, NFIB-siRNA, and co-transfecting and detecting NFIB mRNA and protein, we found that miR-138-5p negatively regulated NFIB expression. In conclusion, lncRNA SNHG12 could alleviate neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in a PD cell model by regulating the miR-138-5p/NFIB axis, providing new therapeutic targets for patients with PD.",-1
Impact of microRNA Regulated Macrophage Actions on Adipose Tissue Function in Obesity,"Obesity-induced adipose tissue dysfunction is bolstered by chronic, low-grade inflammation and impairs systemic metabolic health. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) perpetuate local inflammation but are crucial to adipose tissue homeostasis, exerting heterogeneous, niche-specific functions. Diversified macrophage actions are shaped through finely regulated factors, including microRNAs, which post-transcriptionally alter macrophage activation. Numerous studies have highlighted microRNAs' importance to immune function and potential as inflammation-modulatory. This review summarizes current knowledge of regulatory networks governed by microRNAs in ATMs in white adipose tissue under obesity stress.",-1
Fusing pre-trained convolutional neural networks features for multi-differentiated subtypes of liver cancer on histopathological images,"Liver cancer is a malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality, which has a tremendous negative impact on human survival. However, it is a challenging task to recognize tens of thousands of histopathological images of liver cancer by naked eye, which poses numerous challenges to inexperienced clinicians. In addition, factors such as long time-consuming, tedious work and huge number of images impose a great burden on clinical diagnosis. Therefore, our study combines convolutional neural networks with histopathology images and adopts a feature fusion approach to help clinicians efficiently discriminate the differentiation types of primary hepatocellular carcinoma histopathology images, thus improving their diagnostic efficiency and relieving their work pressure. In this study, for the first time, 73 patients with different differentiation types of primary liver cancer tumors were classified. We performed an adequate classification evaluation of liver cancer differentiation types using four pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and nine different machine learning (ML) classifiers on a dataset of liver cancer histopathology images with multiple differentiation types. And the test set accuracy, validation set accuracy, running time with different strategies, precision, recall and F1 value were used for adequate comparative evaluation. Proved by experimental results, fusion networks (FuNet) structure is a good choice, which covers both channel attention and spatial attention, and suppresses channel interference with less information. Meanwhile, it can clarify the importance of each spatial location by learning the weights of different locations in space, then apply it to the study of classification of multi-differentiated types of liver cancer. In addition, in most cases, the Stacking-based integrated learning classifier outperforms other ML classifiers in the classification task of multi-differentiation types of liver cancer with the FuNet fusion strategy after dimensionality reduction of the fused features by principle component analysis (PCA) features, and a satisfactory result of 72.46% is achieved in the test set, which has certain practicality.",-1
"Virome Diversity among Mosquito Populations in a Sub-Urban Region of Marseille, France","Some mosquito species have significant public health importance given their ability to transmit major diseases to humans and animals, making them the deadliest animals in the world. Among these, the Aedes (Ae.) genus is a vector of several viruses such as Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika viruses that can cause serious pathologies in humans. Since 2004, Ae. albopictus has been encountered in the South of France, and autochthonous cases of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika diseases have recently been reported, further highlighting the need for a comprehensive survey of the mosquitoes and their associated viruses in this area. Using high throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques, we report an analysis of the DNA and RNA viral communities of three mosquito species Ae. albopictus, Culex (Cx.) pipiens, and Culiseta (Cs.) longiareolata vectors of human infectious diseases in a small sub-urban city in the South of France. Results revealed the presence of a significant diversity of viruses known to infect bacteria, plants, insects, and mammals. Several novel viruses were detected, including novel members of the Rhabdoviridae, Totiviridae, Iflaviviridae, Circoviridae, and Sobemoviridae families. No sequence related to major zoonotic viruses transmitted by mosquitoes was detected. The use of HTS on arthropod vector populations is a promising strategy for monitoring the emergence and circulation of zoonoses and epizooties. This study is a contribution to the knowledge of the mosquito microbiome.",-1
Intermittent caloric restriction with a modified fasting-mimicking diet ameliorates autoimmunity and promotes recovery in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis,"Dietary interventions such as fasting have been proved to be effective in the prevention of metabolic and autoimmune diseases as well as aging-related conditions. The complicated interaction between nutrition and immunity has drawn wide attention in recent years. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of intermittent caloric restriction on autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis, in mice. EAE was induced by immunization of C57BL/6 mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 peptide. After the EAE symptoms became obvious at the 4th week post-immunization, the mice were administered with a modified fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) at 1/3 cal of control for 3 days, followed by ad libitum with normal chow for 4 days. A total of two cycles of FMD was applied. Compared with the mice without receiving caloric restriction, the mice using FMD had significant decreases in EAE severity, immune cell infiltration in spinal cord and CNS demyelination. FMD administration also reversed EAE-mediated CNS accumulation of total CD4+ T cells and in particular, IFN-Î³-producing CD4+ T cells. Moreover, FMD application elevated the cell proliferation rate in CNS and enhanced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and remyelination markers. In conclusion, our results indicate that intermittent caloric restriction using the modified FMD was effective in the treatment of EAE through ameliorating inflammatory response and promoting recovery of the damaged tissue.",-1
GM-Pep: A High Efficiency Strategy to De Novo Design Functional Peptide Sequences,"Although peptides are regarded as ideal therapeutic agents, only a small proportion of the marketed drugs are peptides. In the past decade, pharmacists have paid great attention to the development of peptide therapeutics. Except a few approved chemically/rationally designed peptides, most attempts failed due to unsatisfactory efficacy or safety. Luckily, computation methods, such as artificial intelligence, have been utilized to accelerate the discovery of therapeutic peptides by predicting the activity, toxicity, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of polypeptides. Usually, a specific biological activity of a peptide could be accurately determined by an interest-oriented binary classification constructed of a positive set and another un-experimentally validated negative set regardless of other characteristics, which suggests that it could be challenging to realize the comprehensive evaluation of the research object in the early stage of drug research and development. Herein, we proposed an integrated method (GM-Pep) that contained a conditional variational autoencoder model (CVAE) and a positive sample training multiclassifier (Deep-Multiclassifier) to effectively generate a single bioactive peptide sequence without toxicity and referential side effects. The results showed that our Deep-Multiclassifier model gave a sequence accuracy of up to 96.41% [toxicity (94.48%), antifungal (96.58%), antihypertensive (97.18%), and antibacterial (96.91%), respectively]. The properties of Deep-Multiclassifier and CVAE were validated through 12 first synthesized antibacterial peptides or compared to random peptides.

Distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot ulcer patients with necrotizing fasciitis at a diabetic foot center in China,"Background:                    Diabetic foot ulcer is one of the major complications for patients with diabetes, and has become an important cause of non-traumatic amputation. Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening soft-tissue infection involving the fascia and subcutaneous tissue. When diabetic foot ulcers are complicated by necrotizing fasciitis (DNF), this increases the risk for amputation and mortality, making DNF treatment more complicated, and eventually leading to amputation and mortality. However, studies on pathogenic bacteria's distribution and drug sensitivity in DNF patients remain lacking. This study investigated the distribution and susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria in DNF patients, and provided empirical antibacterial guidance for the clinic.              Methods:                    In a single diabetic foot center, the results from microbial cultures and drug susceptibility tests of patients with DNF from October 2013 to December 2020 were collected and analyzed.              Results:                    A total of 101 DNF patients were included in this study, of whom 94 had positive culture test results. A total of 124 pathogens were cultured, including 76 Gram-positive bacterial strains, 42 Gram-negative bacterial strains, and six fungal strains. Polymicrobial infections accounted for 26.7% and monomicrobial infections accounted for 66.3%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacterium isolated, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis were the most common Gram-negative bacteria. Thirty-five strains of multi-drug resistant bacteria were isolated, representing 28.2% of the total isolates. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, and linezolid, while Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem.              Conclusions:                    Gram-positive bacteria were the main bacteria isolated from DNF patients. The bacterial composition, the proportion of multi-drug resistant bacteria among the pathogens, and the high risk for amputation should be fully considered in the initial empirical medication, and broad-spectrum antibacterials are recommended.",-1
Fat mass changes during menopause: a metaanalysis,"Objective:                    Data: Fat mass has been shown to increase in aging women; however, the extent to which menopausal status mediates these changes remains unclear. The purpose of this review was to determine (1) how fat mass differs in quantity and distribution between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, (2) whether and how age and/or menopausal status moderates any observed differences, and (3) which type of fat mass measure is best suited to the detection of differences in fat mass between groups.              Study:                    This review with metaanalyses is reported according to Metaanalysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.              Study appraisal and synthesis methods:                    Studies (published up to May 2018) were identified via PubMed to provide fat mass measures in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We included 201 cross-sectional studies in the metaanalysis, which provided a combined sample size of 1,049,919 individuals and consisted of 478,734 premenopausal women and 571,185 postmenopausal women. Eleven longitudinal studies were included in the metaanalyses, which provided a combined sample size of 2472 women who were premenopausal at baseline and postmenopausal at follow up.              Results:                    The main findings of this review were that fat mass significantly increased between premenopausal and postmenopausal women across most measures, which included body mass index (1.14 kg/m2; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.32 kg/m2), bodyweight (1 kg; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-1.57 kg), body fat percentage (2.88%; 95% confidence interval, 2.13-3.63%), waist circumference (4.63 cm; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-5.35 cm), hip circumference (2.01 cm; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-2.65 cm), waist-hip ratio (0.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.05), visceral fat (26.90 cm2; 95% confidence interval, 13.12-40.68), and trunk fat percentage (5.49%; 95% confidence interval, 3.91-7.06 cm2). The exception was total leg fat percentage, which significantly decreased (-3.19%; 95% confidence interval, -5.98 to -0.41%). No interactive effects were observed between menopausal status and age across all fat mass measures.              Conclusion:                    The change in fat mass quantity between premenopausal and postmenopausal women was attributable predominantly to increasing age; menopause had no significant additional influence. However, the decrease in total leg fat percentage and increase in measures of central fat are indicative of a possible change in fat mass distribution after menopause. These changes are likely to, at least in part, be due to hormonal shifts that occur during midlife when women have a higher androgen (ie, testosterone) to estradiol ratio after menopause, which has been linked to enhanced central adiposity deposition. Evidently, these findings suggest attention should be paid to the accumulation of central fat after menopause, whereas increases in total fat mass should be monitored consistently across the lifespan.",-1
The Dose-Response Effects of Consuming High Fructose Corn Syrup-Sweetened Beverages on Hepatic Lipid Content and Insulin Sensitivity in Young Adults,"Increased hepatic lipid content and decreased insulin sensitivity have critical roles in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the dose-response effects of consuming high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-sweetened beverages for two weeks on hepatic lipid content and insulin sensitivity in young (18-40 years) adults (BMI 18-35 kg/m2). In a parallel, double-blinded study, participants consumed three beverages/day providing 0% (aspartame: n = 23), 10% (n = 18), 17.5% (n = 16), or 25% (n = 28) daily energy requirements from HFCS. Magnetic resonance imaging for hepatic lipid content and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted during 3.5-day inpatient visits at baseline and again at the end of a 15-day intervention. During the 12 intervening outpatient days participants consumed their usual diets with their assigned beverages. Significant linear dose-response effects were observed for increases of hepatic lipid content (p = 0.015) and glucose and insulin AUCs during OGTT (both p = 0.0004), and for decreases in the Matsuda (p = 0.0087) and Predicted M (p = 0.0027) indices of insulin sensitivity. These dose-response effects strengthen the mechanistic evidence implicating consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages as a contributor to the metabolic dysregulation that increases risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes.",-1
Smell tests can discriminate Parkinson's disease patients from healthy individuals: A meta-analysis,"Background:                    Olfactory impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors aimed to identify the clinical tests used to assess olfactory function and examine their ability to distinguish PD with different disease duration from healthy individuals with physiological aging.              Methods:                    Cross-sectional studies published until May 2020 that assessed the olfaction of individuals with PD using search terms related to PD, olfactory function, and assessment were searched on PubMed, PsycInfo, Cinahl, and Web of Science databases.              Results:                    Twelve smell tests were identified from the reviewed studies (n = 125) that assessed 8776 individuals with PD. Data of 6593 individuals with PD and 8731 healthy individuals were included in the meta-analyses. Individuals with PD presented worse performance than healthy individuals, regardless of the smell test used. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) was used by most studies (n = 2310 individuals with PD) and presented smaller heterogeneity. When the studies were subclassified according to the years of PD duration, there were no significant differences.              Conclusion:                    All smell tests were able to discriminate the olfactory function of PD from that of healthy individuals, although the UPSIT was widely used. The abnormal olfaction was not related to the disease duration. Systematic review protocol registration (PROSPERO/2020-CRD42020160878).",-1
Chronic lead exposure induces fatty liver disease associated with the variations of gut microbiota,"Background:                    Lead (Pb) has been suggested as an endocrine-disrupting chemical. However, few studies have investigated the association between chronic Pb exposure and fatty liver disease.              Objectives:                    We aimed to investigate the association of chronic Pb exposure with fatty liver disease and whether the variations of the gut microbiota involve in the mechanism of the fatty liver disease induced by chronic Pb exposure.              Methods:                    We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3066 rural participants in East China. Blood lead level (BLL) was detected, and abdominal ultrasonography was used to diagnose hepatic steatosis. Both the definition of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) were used. Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups and each group was exposed to 0 or 0.05% w/v Pb through drinking water for 28 weeks. The relevant parameters of hepatic lipid metabolism and gut microbiota were analyzed.              Results:                    In humans, after adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of having NAFLD and MAFLD were significantly increased by 54% and 52% in the participants in the fourth BLL quartile (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.24, 1.91 and OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22, 1.89). In the rats, chronic Pb exposure induced the increased visceral fat, hepatic steatosis, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, including the decrease of richness, diversity, evenness and phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiota and the significant alternations of the gut microbiota composition, particularly, the decrease of the relative abundance of Coprococcus and Oscillospira at the genus level.              Conclusions:                    Chronic Pb exposure could induce fatty liver disease, which may be associated with the variations of the gut microbiota.",-1
Identification of novel rheumatoid arthritis-associated MiRNA-204-5p from plasma exosomes,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by infiltration of immune cells in the synovium. However, the crosstalk of immune cells and synovial fibroblasts is still largely unknown. Here, global miRNA screening in plasma exosomes was carried out with a custom microarray (RA patients vs. healthy controls = 9:9). A total of 14 exosomal miRNAs were abnormally expressed in the RA patients. Then, downregulated expression of exosomal miR-204-5p was confirmed in both the replication (RA patients vs. healthy controls = 30:30) and validation groups (RA patients vs. healthy controls = 56:60). Similar to the findings obtained in humans, a decreased abundance of exosomal miR-204-5p was observed in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis indicated that plasma exosomal miR-204-5p expression was inversely correlated with disease parameters of RA patients, such as rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. In vitro, our data showed that human T lymphocytes released exosomes containing large amounts of miR-204-5p, which can be transferred into synovial fibroblasts, inhibiting cell proliferation. Overexpression of miR-204-5p in synovial fibroblasts suppressed synovial fibroblast activation by targeting genes related to cell proliferation and invasion. In vivo assays found that administration of lentiviruses expressing miR-204-5p markedly alleviated the disease progression of the mice with CIA. Collectively, this study identified a novel RA-associated plasma exosomal miRNA-204-5p that mediates the communication between immune cells and synovial fibroblasts and can be used as a potential biomarker for RA diagnosis and treatment.",-1
Can Low-Dose of Dietary Vitamin E Supplementation Reduce Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage and Oxidative Stress? A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Vitamin E plays an important role in attenuating muscle damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. Despites of beneficial effects from antioxidant supplementation, effects of antioxidants on exercise-induced muscle damage are still unclear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of dietary vitamin E supplementation on exercise-induced muscle damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The literature search was conducted through PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, Scopus, SPORTDiscuss, EBSCO, Google Scholar database up to February 2022. A total of 44 RCTs were selected, quality was assessed according to the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool (CCRBT), and they were analyzed by Revman 5.3. Dietary vitamin E supplementation had a protective effect on muscle damage represented by creatine kinase (CK; SMD -1.00, 95% CI: -1.95, -0.06) and lactate dehydrogenase (SMD -1.80, 95% CI: -3.21, -0.39). Muscle damage was more reduced when CK was measured immediately after exercise (SMD -1.89, 95% CI: -3.39, -0.39) and subjects were athletes (SMD -5.15, 95% CI: -9.92, -0.39). Especially vitamin E supplementation lower than 500 IU had more beneficial effects on exercise-induced muscle damage as measured by CK (SMD -1.94, 95% CI: -2.99, -0.89). In conclusion, dietary vitamin E supplementation lower than 500 IU could prevent exercise-induced muscle damage and had greater impact on athletes.",-1
Down Regulated Expression Levels of miR-27b and miR-451a as a Potential Biomarker for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing TAC Chemotherapy,"Background:                    Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor prognosis, aggressive phenotype(s) of tumours, partial chemotherapy response, and lack of clinically proven therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can target and modulate key genes that are involved in TNBC chemotherapy. Deregulated miRNA expression is highly involved in anti-cancer drug resistance phenotype and thus, miRNAs tend to be promising candidates for prediction of chemotherapy response and recurrence.              Aim:                    This study aimed to investigate the expression levels of selected miRNAs (miR-21, miR-27b, miR-34a, miR-182, miR-200c and miR-451a) in cancerous and normal adjacent tissues of TNBC patients and to correlate with the clinicopathological data.              Methods:                    Forty-one (41) FFPE tissue block of histopathologically confirmed TNBC patients was collected. Total RNA from the cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were isolated, transcribed, and pre-amplified. The relative expression level of miRNAs in tumour and normal adjacent tissues of TNBC patients was analysed using qRT-PCR.              Results:                    Out of six miRNAs studied, the relative expression of miR-27b and miR-451a were found to be significantly lower in cancerous as compared to normal adjacent tissues of TNBC patients. In addition, a significant down regulation of miR-451a was also observed in infiltrating ductal carcinoma subtype, stages I and II, in both grade II and III, premenopausal and postmenopausal as well as in those with positive axillary lymph node metastases.              Conclusion:                    The results suggest the possible utilization of miR-27b and miR-451a expression levels as potential predictive risk markers for TNBC patients undergoing TAC chemotherapy.",-1
Effects of Platelet-Rich Plasma on Fat and Nanofat Survival: An Experimental Study on Mice,"Background:                    Nanofat and fat graft survival is an important clinical problem. The authors of this study investigated whether PRP has an impact on fat and nanofat graft survival and vascularization in a mouse model.              Materials and methods:                    Fat was harvested from a 50-year-old healthy woman by vacuum suction, and nanofat was obtained by emulsification and centrifugation procedures. PRP was collected after two rounds of centrifugation from an autologous blood sample. Twenty male nude mice were divided into four treatment groups: PRP/nanofat, PRP/fat, saline/nanofat and saline/fat. After 1 month and 3 months, the grafts were extracted and weighed. The microstructure of the fat and nanofat was examined with a scanning electron microscope. HE and immunohistochemical staining was applied to observe neovascularization. Western blot analysis was used to analyse the expression of CD31 and VEGF.              Results:                    In fat tissue, fat cells had normal connections; the fat structure was complete and fibre networks were visible. In nanofat, the extracellular matrix vascular components were visible and their structures were intact. At 1 month and 3 months, the graft weights in the PRP/fat group were significantly higher than those in the other groups. Further, a higher degree of neovascularization was observed in the PRP/nanofat group, and the expression of CD31 and VEGF in the PRP/nanofat group was higher than that in the other groups.              Conclusion:                    PRP can promote nanofat and fat graft survival and vascularization.

Measures of mental health and addictions conditions show a U-shaped relationship with self-rated worker performance,"Background:                    Reports of a meaningful relationship between mental health-related conditions and work productivity measures are relatively common. These, however, are frequently examined for their linearity while ignoring untapped, and potentially rich, non-linear associations.              Methods:                    Following a serendipitous finding of a curvilinear relationship between workplace presenteeism (lowered productivity while at work) and depression, an investigation was undertaken of the association between worklife prevalence measures of presenteeism (measured by the W.H.O. Health & Work Performance Questionnaire) and lifetime prevalence of twelve psychosocial vulnerabilities, encompassing mental health, mental health-related, and addictive conditions. Linear and quadratic (U-shaped) functions were calculated across the ""relative"" presenteeism measure (self vs. other workers) for each of the 12 conditions.              Results:                    A visual analysis revealed a U-shaped graphic function in all conditions, and excepting anxiety all were statistically significant. In general, increases beyond the lowest (""poorest"") level of self-reported comparative productivity were associated with increases in psychosocial stability, but only as far as deemed equality. Beyond that, increases in self-confidence resulted in a reversal, thus returning to a higher level of vulnerability for the condition in question. A cursory scan of five relevant journals indicated that non-linear analyses were often possible, but rarely carried out.              Conclusions:                    This has informative value for our conceptualization of overconfidence, and it begs the question of whether an over-reliance on linear measures has caused us to overlook important curvilinear human relationships. The inclusion of analyses of non-linear functions is suggested as a matter of course for future studies.",-1
The association of hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance with incident depressive symptoms over 4 years of follow-up: The Maastricht Study,"Aims/hypothesis:                    Depression is twice as common in individuals with type 2 diabetes as in the general population. However, it remains unclear whether hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance are directly involved in the aetiology of depression. Therefore, we investigated the association of markers of hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance, measured as continuous variables, with incident depressive symptoms over 4 years of follow-up.              Methods:                    We used data from the longitudinal population-based Maastricht Study (n = 2848; mean age 59.9 Â± 8.1 years, 48.8% women, 265 incident depression cases, 10,932 person-years of follow-up). We assessed hyperglycaemia by fasting and 2 h post-load OGTT glucose levels, HbA1c and skin autofluorescence (reflecting AGEs) at baseline. We used the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index and HOMA-IR to calculate insulin resistance at baseline. Depressive symptoms (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire score â?0) were assessed at baseline and annually over 4 years. We used Cox regression analyses, and adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors.              Results:                    Fasting plasma glucose, 2 h post-load glucose and HbA1c levels were associated with an increased risk for incident depressive symptoms after full adjustment (HR 1.20 [95% CI 1.08, 1.33]; HR 1.25 [1.08, 1.44]; and HR 1.22 [1.09, 1.37] per SD, respectively), while skin autofluorescence, insulin sensitivity index and HOMA-IR were not (HR 0.99 [0.86, 1.13]; HR 1.02 [0.85, 1.25]; and HR 0.93 [0.81, 1.08], per SD, respectively).              Conclusions/interpretation:                    The observed temporal association between hyperglycaemia and incident depressive symptoms in this study supports the presence of a mechanistic link between hyperglycaemia and the development of depressive symptoms.

The Impact of Diabetes Status on Presenteeism in Japan,"Objective:                    This study aimed to investigate the impact of diabetes status on presenteeism in companies in Japan.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional study was conducted among workers aged 40 years or older. Using medical examination results and health insurance claims data, participants were classified as normal, borderline, or diabetic. The diabetic group was further classified as untreated or treated. The Quantity and Quality (QQ) method was used as an evaluation index of presenteeism. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict presenteeism loss.              Results:                    Data on 13,292 people were analyzed. Presenteeism loss was significantly higher in the diabetic group versus the normal group. The untreated group did not differ from the normal group, but presenteeism loss was significantly higher in the treated group.              Conclusions:                    Presenteeism loss may occur among diabetic workers in Japan and can be caused by diabetes treatment.",-1
Does non-activated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) enhance fat graft outcome? An assessment with 3D CT-scan in mice,"Background:                    The adjunction of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is emerging as a promising approach to enhance the long-term survival of fat grafting, but there are still insufficient data on its efficacy. The aim of this in vivo study was to assess the effect of the addition of non-activated PRP on fat graft outcome.              Methods:                    Human adipose tissue mixed with 20% of non-activated PRP was injected under the scalp skin of nude Balb/cAnNRj mice and compared to grafted fat mixed with 20% of saline. The fat graft volume was analyzed by a computed tomography scan until day 90 and immunohistochemistry was then performed to assess adipocyte viability and graft revascularization.              Results:                    At day 90, the volume of fat graft was not enhanced by PRP compared to the saline control group. However, immunohistochemistry showed that PRP significantly increased the fat graft area occupied by intact adipocytes compared to the saline group (72.66% vs. 60.78%, respectively; p < 0.05). Vascularity was also significantly higher in the PRP group compared to the control group (6695 vs. 4244 CD31+ cells/Âµm2, respectively; p < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    The adjunction of non-activated-PRP to fat grafts significantly increased adipocyte viability and tissue vascularity. However, in contrast to other studies adding activated-PRP, non-activated-PRP did not increase residual fat graft volume until day 90. Further studies are therefore needed to understand whether PRP has a positive effect on fat graft volume. As 3D computed tomography scan is a reproducible and precise technique, it should be used to analyze fat graft volume changes over time.",-1
High pyrethroid/DDT resistance in major malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii from Niger-Delta of Nigeria is probably driven by metabolic resistance mechanisms,"Entomological surveillance of local malaria vector populations is an important component of vector control and resistance management. In this study, the resistance profile and its possible mechanisms was characterised in a field population of the major malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii from Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers state, in the Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria. Larvae collected in Port-Harcourt, were reared to adulthood and used for WHO bioassays. The population exhibited high resistance to permethrin, deltamethrin and DDT with mortalities of 6.7% Â± 2.4, 37.5% Â± 3.2 and 6.3% Â± 4.1, respectively, but were fully susceptible to bendiocarb and malathion. Synergist bioassays with piperonylbutoxide (PBO) partially recovered susceptibility, with mortalities increasing to 53% Â± 4, indicating probable role of CYP450s in permethrin resistance (Ï2 = 29.48, P < 0.0001). Transcriptional profiling revealed five major resistance-associated genes overexpressed in the field samples compared to the fully susceptible laboratory colony, Ngoussou. Highest fold change (FC) was observed with GSTe2 (FC = 3.3 in permethrin exposed and 6.2 in unexposed) and CYP6Z3 (FC = 1.4 in exposed and 4.6 in unexposed). TaqMan genotyping of 32 F0 females detected the 1014F and 1575Y knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations with frequencies of 0.84 and 0.1, respectively, while 1014S mutation was not detected. Sequencing of a fragment of the voltage-gated sodium channel, spanning exon 20 from 13 deltamethrin-resistant and 9 susceptible females revealed only 2 distinct haplotypes with a low haplotype diversity of 0.33. The findings of high pyrethroid resistance but with a significant degree of recovery after PBO synergist assay suggests the need to move to PBO-based nets. This could be complemented with carbamate- or organophosphate-based indoor residual spraying in this area.",-1
Correlation between Serum Zinc Levels and Levodopa in Parkinson's Disease,"Long-term intake of potential zinc-chelating drugs may cause zinc deficiency. We postulated that zinc deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients was related to the intake of drugs such as levodopa. We investigated the relationship between zinc levels and levodopa administration period, dosage, and symptoms of zinc deficiency in PD patients. We measured serum zinc levels and analyzed correlations between serum zinc levels, the levodopa oral administration period, dosage, dosing frequency, and zinc deficiency symptoms including taste disorders. Data analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The mean serum zinc level was 60.5 Â± 11.6 Î¼g/dL. The mean administration period for levodopa was 8.0 Â± 5.5 years, mean administration frequency 3.4 Â± 0.9 times/d, and mean administration dose 420.6 Â± 237.1 mg/d. Negative correlations between zinc levels and levodopa dosage and dosing frequency were found. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant correlation with the frequency of levodopa (Î² = -0.360, p = 0.007). No significant change in clinical symptoms was observed after zinc administration, but anxiety tended to improve. Our results indicated that frequent levodopa administration strongly influenced serum zinc levels which may have alleviating effects on psychiatric symptoms; therefore, preventing zinc deficiency can be important during PD treatment.",-1
"Comparative Safety, Bioavailability, and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Dexamethasone, 4-mg and 20-mg Tablets, in Healthy Volunteers Under Fasting and Fed Conditions: A Randomized Open-label, 3-way Crossover Study","Background:                    Glucocorticoids, particularly dexamethasone, are often used in combination with novel agents in multiple myeloma. This study compared the safety, rate, and extent of absorption of a single dose of an orally administered 20-mg dexamethasone tablet to five 4-mg tablets (total, 20 mg).              Patients and methods:                    This was a single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover comparative study. Thirty-six volunteers received at least 1 dose of either a single 20-mg dexamethasone tablet, under fasting or fed conditions, or five 4-mg dexamethasone tablets (total, 20 mg). Blood samples were collected before study drug administration and at 21 time points for up to 36 hours after drug administration.              Results:                    Mean area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of last non-zero concentration (AUC0-t), mean area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (extrapolated) (AUC0-â?, and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) were 1314.38 ng Ã h/mL, 1329.24 ng Ã h/mL, and 257.22 ng/mL, respectively for fasting test formulation (single dexamethasone 20-mg tablet), 1339.74 ng Ã h/mL, 1358.07 ng Ã h/mL, and 194.56 ng/mL, respectively, for the fed test formulation (single dexamethasone 20-mg tablet), and 1325.12 ng Ã h/mL, 1342.12 ng Ã h/mL, and 244.12 ng/mL, respectively, for the reference formulation (5 dexamethasone 4-mg tablets). The median time of observed Cmax was 0.997 hours for the fasting and 2.502 hours for the fed test formulation, compared with 1.495 hours for the reference. Mean plasma elimination half-lives (t1/2) were 4.0 hours (test fasting), 4.03 hours (test fed), and 3.96 hours (reference). The point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for AUC0-t, AUC0-â? and Cmax were 99.37% (90% CI, 95.65%-103.24%), 99.24% (90% CI, 95.47%-103.16%), and 106.28% (90% CI, 97.69%-115.62%), respectively, satisfying the bioequivalence criteria of the United States Food and Drug Administration guidelines.              Conclusion:                    The 2 formulations were well-tolerated, and one 20-mg tablet or five 4-mg tablets of dexamethasone are bioequivalent under fasting conditions and thus may be prescribed interchangeably.",-1
Neural correlates and predictors of subjective cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may occur very early in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) before the onset of objective cognitive decline. Data on neural correlates and determinants of SCD in PD are rare.              Objective:                    The aim of the present study was to identify neural correlates as well as sociodemographic, clinical, and neuropsychological predictors of SCD in patients with PD.              Methods:                    We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with PD without cognitive impairment (23% female, 66.90 Â± 7.20 years, UPDRS-III: 19.83 Â± 9.29), of which n = 12 patients were classified as having no SCD (control group, PD-CG) and n = 18 as having SCD (PD-SCD). Neuropsychological testing and 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) were conducted. SCD was assessed using a questionnaire covering multiple cognitive domains.              Results:                    SCD subscores differed significantly between PD-CG and PD-SCD and correlated significantly with other scales measuring related concepts. FDG-PET whole-brain voxel-wise regression analysis revealed hypometabolism in middle frontal, middle temporal, and occipital areas, and the angular gyrus as neural correlates of SCD in PD. Next to this hypometabolism, depressive symptoms were an independent significant determinant of SCD in a stepwise regression analysis (adjusted R2 = 50.3%).              Conclusion:                    This study strengthens the hypothesis of SCD being an early manifestation of future cognitive decline in PD and, more generally, early pathological changes in PD. The early identification of the vulnerability for future cognitive decline constitutes the basis for successful prevention and delay of this non-motor symptom.",-1
"Genome Sequence Analysis of First Ross River Virus Isolate from Papua New Guinea Indicates Long-Term, Local Evolution","Ross River virus (RRV) is the most medically significant mosquito-borne virus of Australia, in terms of human morbidity. RRV cases, characterised by febrile illness and potentially persistent arthralgia, have been reported from all Australian states and territories. RRV was the cause of a large-scale epidemic of multiple Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) from 1979 to 1980, involving at least 50,000 cases. Historical evidence of RRV seropositivity beyond Australia, in populations of Papua New Guinea (PNG), Indonesia and the Solomon Islands, has been documented. We describe the genomic characterisation and timescale analysis of the first isolate of RRV to be sampled from PNG to date. Our analysis indicates that RRV has evolved locally within PNG, independent of Australian lineages, over an approximate 40 year period. The mean time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the unique PNG clade coincides with the initiation of the PICTs epidemic in mid-1979. This may indicate that an ancestral variant of the PNG clade was seeded into the region during the epidemic, a period of high RRV transmission. Further epidemiological and molecular-based surveillance is required in PNG to better understand the molecular epidemiology of RRV in the general Australasian region.",-1
Long non-coding RNA SNHG5 promotes the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells via the miR-212-3p/GDF5/SMAD pathway,"Background:                    The treatment of bone loss has posed a challenge to clinicians for decades. Thus, it is of great significance to identify more effective methods for bone regeneration. However, the role and mechanisms of long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) during osteogenic differentiation remain unclear.              Methods:                    We investigated the function of SNHG5, Yin Yang 1 (YY1), miR-212-3p and growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) in osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Molecular mechanisms were clarified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and dual luciferase reporter assay.              Results:                    We found SNHG5 expression was upregulated during osteogenesis of hBMSCs. Knockdown of SNHG5 in hBMSCs inhibited osteogenic differentiation while overexpression of SNHG5 promoted osteogenesis. Moreover, YY1 transcription factor directly bound to the promoter region of SNHG5 and regulated SNHG5 expression to promote osteogenesis. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that SNHG5 acted as a miR-212-3p sponge and miR-212-3p directly targeted GDF5 and further activated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. miR-212-3p inhibited osteogenic differentiation, while GDF5 promoted osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. In addition, calvarial defect experiments showed knockdown of SNHG5 and GDF5 inhibited new bone formation in vivo.              Conclusion:                    Our results demonstrated that the novel pathway YY1/SNHG5/miR-212-3p/GDF5/Smad regulates osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs and may serve as a potential target for the treatment of bone loss.",-1
Larval habitat diversity and Anopheles mosquito species distribution in different ecological zones in Ghana,"Background:                    Understanding the ecology of larval malaria and lymphatic filariasis mosquitoes in a changing environment is important in developing effective control tools or programmes. This study characterized the breeding habitats of Anopheles mosquitoes in rural communities in different ecological zones in Ghana during the dry and rainy seasons.              Methods:                    The spatio-temporal distribution, species composition, and abundance of larval Anopheles mosquitoes in breeding habitats were studied in five locations in three ecological zones of Ghana. These were Anyakpor (coastal savannah area), Duase (forest area), and Libga, Pagaza, and Kpalsogu (Sahel savannah area). Larvae were collected using standard dippers and were raised in the insectary for identification.              Results:                    Out of a total of 7984 mosquito larvae collected, 2152 (27.26%) were anophelines and were more abundant in the rainy season (70.82%) than in the dry season (29.18%). The anophelines comprised 2128 (98.88%) An. gambiae s.l., 16 (0.74%) An. rufipes, and 8 (0.37%) An. pharoensis. In the coastal savannah and forest zones, dug-out wells were the most productive habitat during the dry (1.59 larvae/dip and 1.47 larvae/dip) and rainy seasons (11.28 larvae/dip and 2.05 larvae/dip). Swamps and furrows were the most productive habitats in the Sahel savannah zone during the dry (0.25 larvae/dip) and rainy (2.14 larvae/dip) seasons, respectively. Anopheles coluzzii was the most abundant sibling species in all the ecological zones. Anopheles melas and An. arabiensis were encountered only in the coastal savannah and the Sahel savannah areas, respectively. Larval habitat types influenced the presence of larvae as well as larval density (p < 0.001). The land-use type affected the presence of Anopheles larvae (p = 0.001), while vegetation cover influenced larval density (p < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    The most productive habitats were dug-out wells in the coastal savannah and forest zones, and furrows from irrigated canals in the Sahel savannah zone. Anopheles coluzzii was the predominant vector species in all the ecological zones. The abundance of Anopheles breeding habitats and larvae were influenced by anthropogenic activities. Encouraging people whose activities create the larval habitats to become involved in larval source management such as habitat manipulation to stop mosquito breeding will be important for malaria and lymphatic filariasis control.",-1
Self-reported behavior of eating quickly is correlated with visceral fat area in Japanese non-obese adults,"Background and objectives:                    This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between eating speed and fat accumulation in Japanese non-obese adults.              Methods and study design:                    In total, 381 non-obese participants aged 35-74 years underwent a health checkup including fat distribution. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging to quantify visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA). Information on eating speed was obtained using a self-administrated questionnaire.              Results:                    The numbers of participants with self-reported behavior of eating slowly, medium, or quickly were 24 (6.3%), 180 (47.2%), and 177 (46.5%), respectively. The prevalence of VFA â?00 cm2 was higher in the eating quickly group than in the eating slowly (p<0.05) or medium groups (p<0.05). On the other hand, no significant differences in SFA â?00 cm2 were observed between groups. In addition, multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that eating quickly was positively correlated with VFA (standard Î²=0.068, p<0.05), but not with SFA.              Conclusions:                    Although eating quickly was positively correlated with bigger VFA in Japanese non-obese adults, no associations were found between eating speed and SFA.",-1
Genome-wide association studies in Samoans give insight into the genetic architecture of fasting serum lipid levels,"The current understanding of the genetic architecture of lipids has largely come from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To date, few GWAS have examined the genetic architecture of lipids in Polynesians, and none have in Samoans, whose unique population history, including many population bottlenecks, may provide insight into the biological foundations of variation in lipid levels. Here we performed a GWAS of four fasting serum lipid levels: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG) in a sample of 2849 Samoans, with validation genotyping for associations in a replication cohort comprising 1798 Samoans and American Samoans. We identified multiple genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 Ã 10-8) previously seen in other populations-APOA1 with TG, CETP with HDL, and APOE with TC and LDL-and several suggestive associations (P < 1 Ã 10-5), including an association of variants downstream of MGAT1 and RAB21 with HDL. However, we observed different association signals for variants near APOE than what has been previously reported in non-Polynesian populations. The association with several known lipid loci combined with the newly identified associations with variants near MGAT1 and RAB21 suggest that while some of the genetic architecture of lipids is shared between Samoans and other populations, part of the genetic architecture may be Polynesian-specific.",-1
"Youth with type 2 diabetes have hepatic, peripheral, and adipose insulin resistance","Adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have severe insulin resistance (IR) secondary to obesity, genetics, and puberty, and IR predicts metabolic comorbidities. Adults with T2D have multitissue IR, which has guided therapeutic developments, but this is not established in youth. We sought to assess adipose, hepatic, and peripheral insulin sensitivity in adolescents with and without T2D. Twenty-seven youth with T2D [age: 15.6 Â± 0.4 yr; female: 78%; body mass index (BMI) percentile: 96.1 (52.6, 95.9), late puberty; hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 7.3% (6.2, 10.1)] and 21 controls of similar BMI, pubertal stage, and habitual activity were enrolled. Insulin action was measured with a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (basal, 10, 16, and 80 mUÂ·m-2Â·min-1 for studying adipose, hepatic, and peripheral IR, respectively) with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers. Total fat mass, fat-free mass, liver fat fraction, and visceral fat were measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and MRI, respectively. Free fatty acids (FFAs), lipid profile, and inflammatory markers were also measured. Adolescents with T2D had higher lipolysis ( P = 0.012), endogenous glucose production ( P < 0.0001), and lower glucose clearance ( P = 0.002) during hyperinsulinemia than controls. In T2D, peripheral IR positively correlated to FFA ( P < 0.001), inflammatory markers, visceral ( P = 0.004) and hepatic fat ( P = 0.007); hepatic IR correlated with central obesity ( P = 0.004) and adipose IR ( P = 0.003). Youth with T2D have profound multitissue IR compared with BMI-equivalent youth without T2D. The development of multitissue interactions appears crucial to the pathogenesis of T2D. Therapeutic targets on multitissue IR may be of benefit, deserving of further research.",-1
Simple method to detect and to isolate entomopathogenic fungi (Hypocreales) from mosquito larvae,"Entomopathogenic fungi are important agents for mosquito vector control. We report on the utility of a simple method to detect fungi on living larvae of Aedes aegypti that had been exposed to a fungal entomopathogen. Four species of the hypocrealean genera Metarhizium, Beauveria, Tolypocladium and Culicinomyces, known for their larvicidal activity against mosquito species, were tested. Living larvae previously exposed to a suspension of different conidial concentrations were set directly into the surface water film on non-nutritive agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, thiabendazole and crystal violet and then incubated. Except for C. clavisporus ARSEF 964 (which developed and produced conidia mostly inside the cadaver rather than on its surface in the present study), this method favored external fungal development and conidiogenesis on larvae of different instars after death. The dead larva on the water agar represents the unique and specific source of nutrition for the fungus that killed it. The technique facilitates the detection and posterior isolation of entomopathogenic fungi, and offers a compact, convenient, and rapid means to survey larval mosquito populations for fungal pathogens at the field.",-1
Dopaminergic Therapy for Motor Symptoms in Early Parkinson Disease Practice Guideline Summary: A Report of the AAN Guideline Subcommittee,"Background and objectives:                    To review the current evidence on the options available for initiating dopaminergic treatment of motor symptoms in early-stage Parkinson disease and provide recommendations to clinicians.              Methods:                    A multidisciplinary panel developed practice recommendations, integrating findings from a systematic review and following an Institute of Medicine-compliant process to ensure transparency and patient engagement. Recommendations were supported by structured rationales, integrating evidence from the systematic review, related evidence, principles of care, and inferences from evidence.              Results:                    Initial treatment with levodopa provides superior motor benefit compared to treatment with dopamine agonists, whereas levodopa is more likely than dopamine agonists to cause dyskinesia. The comparison of different formulations of dopamine agonists yielded little evidence that any one formulation or method of administration is superior. Long-acting forms of levodopa and levodopa with entacapone do not appear to differ in efficacy from immediate-release levodopa for motor symptoms in early disease. There is a higher risk of impulse control disorders associated with the use of dopamine agonists than levodopa. Recommendations on initial therapy for motor symptoms are provided to assist the clinician and patient in choosing between treatment options and to guide counseling, prescribing, and monitoring of efficacy and safety.",-1
Spatially clustered count data provide more efficient search strategies in invasion biology and disease control,"Geographic profiling, a mathematical model originally developed in criminology, is increasingly being used in ecology and epidemiology. Geographic profiling boasts a wide range of applications, such as finding source populations of invasive species or breeding sites of vectors of infectious disease. The model provides a cost-effective approach for prioritizing search strategies for source locations and does so via simple data in the form of the positions of each observation, such as individual sightings of invasive species or cases of a disease. In doing so, however, classic geographic profiling approaches fail to make the distinction between those areas containing observed absences and those areas where no data were recorded. Absence data are generated via spatial sampling protocols but are often discarded during the inference process. Here we construct a geographic profiling model that resolves these issues by making inferences via count data, analyzing a set of discrete sentinel locations at which the number of encounters has been recorded. Crucially, in our model this number can be zero. We verify the ability of this new model to estimate source locations and other parameters of practical interest via a Bayesian power analysis. We also measure model performance via real-world data in which the model infers breeding locations of mosquitoes in bromeliads in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. In both cases, our novel model produces more efficient search strategies by shifting focus from those areas containing observed absences to those with no data, an improvement over existing models that treat these areas equally. Our model makes important improvements upon classic geographic profiling methods, which will significantly enhance real-world efforts to develop conservation management plans and targeted interventions.",-1
"Estimates of the population size and dispersal range of Anopheles arabiensis in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: implications for a planned pilot programme to release sterile male mosquitoes","Background:                    Anopheles arabiensis is a major malaria vector, recently implicated as contributing to ongoing residual malaria transmission in South Africa, which feeds and rests both indoors and outdoors. This species is, therefore, not effectively targeted using core malaria vector control interventions alone. Additionally, increasing resistance to available insecticides necessitates investigations into complementary non-insecticide-based vector control methods for outdoor-resting mosquitoes. The feasibility of the sterile insect technique (SIT) as a complementary vector control intervention is being investigated in South Africa. Successful implementation of an SIT programme largely depends on inundating a target insect population with sterilized laboratory-bred males. Therefore, knowledge of the native population size and dispersal ability of released sterile laboratory-reared males is critical. In this study, we estimated the male An. arabiensis population size and the dispersal of released males in an area targeted for a pilot sterile male release programme.              Methods:                    Three separate releases were performed within a 2-year period. Approximately 5000-15,000 laboratory-reared male An. arabiensis (KWAG) were produced and marked for mark-release-recapture experiments. To recapture released mosquitoes, cloth tubes were deployed in widening concentric circles. The average dispersal distance of released males was calculated and the wild male An. arabiensis population size was estimated using two Lincoln index formulae. The natural population was sampled concurrently and Anopheles species diversity examined.              Results:                    The Anopheles gambiae complex and An. funestus group species made up the majority of wild collections along with other anophelines. The An. arabiensis population size was estimated to be between 550 and 9500 males per hectare depending on time of year, weather conditions and method used. Average dispersal distance of marked males ranged from 58 to 86 m. Marked males were found in swarms with wild males, indicating that laboratory-reared males are able to locate and participate in mating swarms.              Conclusions:                    It was logistically feasible to conduct mark-release-recapture studies at the current scale. The population size estimates obtained may provide a guideline for the initial number of males to use for a pending SIT pilot trial. It is promising for future SIT trials that laboratory-reared marked males participated in natural swarms, appearing at the right place at the right time.",-1
Mosquito Identification From Bulk Samples Using DNA Metabarcoding: a Protocol to Support Mosquito-Borne Disease Surveillance in Canada,"Approximately 80 species of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) have been documented in Canada. Exotic species such as Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) are becoming established. Recently occurring endemic mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in Canada including West-Nile virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) are having significant public health impacts. Here we explore the use of DNA metabarcoding to identify mosquitoes from CDC light-trap collections from two locations in eastern Canada. Two primer pairs (BF2-BR2 and F230) were used to amplify regions of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO1) gene. High throughput sequencing was conducted using an Illumina MiSeq platform and GenBank-based species identification was applied using a QIIME 1.9 bioinformatics pipeline. From a site in southeastern Ontario, Canada, 26 CDC light trap collections of 72 to >300 individual mosquitoes were used to explore the capacity of DNA metabarcoding to identify and quantify captured mosquitoes. The DNA metabarcoding method identified 33 species overall while 24 species were identified by key. Using replicates from each trap, the dried biomass needed to identify the majority of species was determined to be 76 mg (equivalent to approximately 72 mosquitoes), and at least two replicates from the dried biomass would be needed to reliably detect the majority of species in collections of 144-215 mosquitoes and three replicates would be advised for collections with >215 mosquitoes. This study supports the use of DNA metabarcoding as a mosquito surveillance tool in Canada which can help identify the emergence of new mosquito-borne disease potential threats.",-1
Deep learning for improving the spatial resolution of magnetic particle imaging,"Objective.Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a new medical, non-destructive, imaging method for visualizing the spatial distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. In MPI, spatial resolution is an important indicator of efficiency; traditional techniques for improving the spatial resolution may result in higher costs, lower sensitivity, or reduced contrast.Approach.Therefore, we propose a deep-learning approach to improve the spatial resolution of MPI by fusing a dual-sampling convolutional neural network (FDS-MPI). An end-to-end model is established to generate high-spatial-resolution images from low-spatial-resolution images, avoiding the aforementioned shortcomings.Main results.We evaluate the performance of the proposed FDS-MPI model through simulation and phantom experiments. The results demonstrate that the FDS-MPI model can improve the spatial resolution by a factor of two.Significance.This significant improvement in MPI could facilitate the preclinical application of medical imaging modalities in the future.",-1
Dietary S. maltophilia induces supersized lipid droplets by enhancing lipogenesis and ER-LD contacts in C. elegans,"Dietary and symbiotic bacteria can exert powerful influence on metazoan lipid metabolism. Recent studies have emerged that microbiota have a role in animal obesity and related health disorders, but the mechanisms by which bacteria influence lipid storage in their host are unknown. To reduce the complexity of the relationship between gut microbiota and the host, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has been chosen as a model organism to study interspecies interaction. Here, we demonstrate that feeding C. elegans with an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) retards growth and promotes excessive neutral lipid storage. Gene expression analysis reveals that dietary S. maltophilia induces a lipogenic transcriptional response that includes the SREBP ortholog SBP-1, and fatty acid desaturases FAT-6 and FAT-7. Live imaging and ultrastructural analysis suggest that excess neutral lipid is stored in greatly expanded lipid droplets (LDs), as a result of enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-LD interaction. We also report that loss of function mutations in dpy-9 in C. elegans confers resistance to S. maltophilia. Dietary S. maltophilia induces supersized LDs by enhancing lipogenesis and ER-LD contacts in C. elegans. This work delineates a new model for understanding microbial regulation of metazoan physiology.",-1
Study on the effect of koumiss on the intestinal microbiota of mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii,"Toxoplasma gondii is a worldwide food-borne parasite that can infect almost all warm-blooded animals, including humans. To date, there are no effective drugs to prevent or eradicate T. gondii infection. Recent studies have shown that probiotics could influence the relationship between the microbiota and parasites in the host. Koumiss has been used to treat many diseases based on its probiotic diversity. Therefore, we explored the effect of koumiss on T. gondii infection via its effect on the host intestinal microbiota. BALB/c mice were infected with T. gondii and treated with PBS, koumiss and mares' milk. Brain cysts were counted, and long-term changes in the microbiota and the effect of koumiss on gut microbiota were investigated with high-throughput sequencing technology. The results suggested that koumiss treatment significantly decreased the cyst counts in the brain (P < 0.05). Moreover, T. gondii infection changed the microbiota composition, and koumiss treatment increased the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Akkermansia muciniphila, which were associated with preventing T. gondii infection. Moreover, koumiss could inhibit or ameliorate T. gondii infection by increasing the abundance of certain bacteria that control unique metabolic pathways. The study not only established a close interaction among the host, intracellular pathogens and intestinal microbiota but also provided a novel focus for drug development to prevent and eradicate T. gondii infection.",-1
A Prussian blue nanoparticles-based fluorescent nanoprobe for monitoring microRNA-92a and microRNA-21,"Since microRNA-92a (miR-92a) and microRNA-21 (miR-21) are crucial biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC), monitoring miR-92a and miR-21 in serum is very significant for the early diagnosis of CRC. In this work, we developed a simple and sensitive fluorescent biosensor for the detection of miR-92a and miR-21 based on the quenching ability of Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) to fluorophores. Carboxyl fluorescein (FAM)-modified ssDNA (P-92a) and Cyanine 5 (Cy5)-modified ssDNA (P-21) were completely complementary to miR-92a and miR-21 separately. They were adsorbed on PBNPs surface by the binding of PO43- in DNA and Fe3+ in PBNPs to fabricate the P-92a + P-21@PBNPs sensing system. The fluorescence responses from P-92a + P-21@PBNPs show good selection to miR-92a and a great linear process with the miR-92a concentration ranging from 1 to 30 nM (ÎF = 10.978 cmiR-92a + 71.457). Meanwhile, the fluorescence responses from P-92a + P-21@PBNPs is linearly relative to miR-21 from 3 to 30 nM; the linear equation is ÎF = 5.7560 cmiR-21 + 48.729. Furthermore, the detections of miR-92a and miR-21 added in serum samples were achieved. In summary, this method is sensitive, highly specific, time-saving, cost-effective and applicable for the detection of miR-92a and miR-21. Therefore, this present sensor was expected to be used in clinical applications, which lays a potential foundation for an early diagnosis of cancer.",-1
Metabolic Syndrome is Associated with Ceramide Accumulation in Visceral Adipose Tissue of Women with Morbid Obesity,"Objective:                    Accelerated transmembrane transport of long-chain fatty acids dependent on fatty acid transporters is responsible for lipid accumulation and, eventually, the development of metabolic syndrome. This study determined the content of lipids (ceramide [CER], diacylglycerol [DAG], triacylglycerol, and free fatty acid [FFA]) and the expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) and plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue of women with morbid obesity without metabolic syndrome (MetSx-) or with metabolic syndrome (MetSx+) and compared the results with those of lean controls without metabolic syndrome.              Methods:                    Lipid content and fatty acid composition in each lipid subclass were estimated by gas liquid chromatography. For total, plasma membrane, and mitochondrial expression of fatty acid transporters, subfractionation with subsequent Western blot technique was used.              Results:                    A greater content of triacylglycerol in VAT of participants with obesity (MetSx-) was found. However, only the MetSx+ subjects had increased content of CER in VAT in relation to subcutaneous adipose tissue in MetSx+ and lean individuals. This was accompanied by increased total and membrane expression of FAT/CD36 in VAT in MetSx+ subjects. Accordingly, mitochondrial expression of FAT/CD36 and plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein was decreased in both groups of subjects with obesity.              Conclusions:                    Metabolic syndrome is associated with the accumulation of CER in VAT, possibly related to increased FAT/CD36 protein expression.",-1
Abdominal Ectopic Thyroid Tissue: The Man From Istanbul,"Thyroid ectopia is a rare finding below the diaphragm. It is characterized by normal thyroid parenchyma in unusual locations with preserved thyroid marker immunoreactivity. In this article, we present the first known case of thyroid tissue in the periappendiceal fat and discuss possible ethiopathogenic theories.",-1
Children Expressing Mixed Emotion in a Nonsocial Context,"Efforts to demonstrate children's ability to report experiencing mixed emotions have typically used an allocentric approach, asking children to report on emotions of other individuals in response to stories or movie clips demonstrating social themes. In contrast, literature examining children's personal experiencing and understanding of their own mixed emotions, typified as an egocentric approach, in nonsocial situations remains underdeveloped. The current study examined the development of children's reported understanding and experience of mixed emotions egocentrically. By examining a nonsocial context, this investigation extends existing gender- and age-related research on expressing egocentric mixed emotion. Using a computerized game with a disappointing wins paradigm, egocentric mixed emotional experience was elicited in 142 children (80 boys, 62 girls) aged 6 to 12 years. Results revealed that age, but not gender, was a statistically significant predictor of expressing egocentric mixed emotion experience and understanding. When studying mixed emotion development in a nonsocial context, gender did not contribute to differences in child reports. A significant positive relationship between egocentric mixed emotion experiencing and understanding also emerged. These findings contribute to our understanding of children's emotion development and offer future directions for examining the broad domain of nonsocial contexts in youth expression of mixed emotions.",-1
The effect and safety of ropinirole in the treatment of Parkinson disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:                    It is necessary to conduct a meta-analysis of the clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ropinirole in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD), to explore the effects and safety of ropinirole, and to provide a theoretical basis for clinically safe and rational drug use.              Methods:                    RCTs on the effectiveness and safety of ropinirole in the treatment of PD were searched. We searched Dutch medical literature database, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Knowledge Service Platform up to December 15, 2020. The Cochrane risk bias assessment tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included literature, and the RevMan5.3 software was used for meta-analysis.              Results:                    A total of 12 RCTs with 3341 patients were included. The changes of Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part II score (mean difference = -2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.82 to -1.64) and Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III scores (mean difference = -4.93, 95%CI -5.25 to -4.61) in the ropinirole group was significantly lower than that in the control group. The incidence of dizziness (odd risk [OR] = 1.85, 95%CI 1.50-2.28), nausea (OR = 2.17, 95%CI 1.81-2.59), vomiting (OR = 2.73, 95%CI 1.47-5.09), and lethargy (OR = 2.19, 95%CI 1.39-3.44) in the ropinirole group was significantly higher than that in the control group (all P < .05), and there were no significant differences in the incidence of headache (OR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.79-1.65) and insomnia (OR = 1.06, 95%CI 0.72-1.55) were found between 2 groups (all P > .05).              Conclusions:                    Ropinirole can help improve the ability of daily living and exercise function of PD patients, but it will increase the incidence of related adverse reactions, which needs to be further confirmed by subsequent large-scale, high-quality RCTs.",-1
Effect of Teriparatide on Bone Mineral Density and Trabecular Bone Score in Type 2 Diabetic Patients with Osteoporosis: A Retrospective Cohort Study,"The BMDs of the lumbar spine, whole femur, and femoral neck and TBS were measured. Change in BMD or TBS was defined as the BMD or TBS at follow-up, performed 1 year after baseline, minus baseline BMD or TBS. Results: This retrospective cohort study included 93 patients, of whom 52 received no medication, 26 received bisphosphonates, and 15 received weekly teriparatide. BMD of the lumbar spine increased in all three groups. There was no change in BMD of the whole femur and femoral neck in the no medication and bisphosphonates groups, whereas the BMD of the whole femur (from 0.73 (0.15) to 0.74 (0.15) g/cm2, p = 0.011) and femoral neck (from 0.59 (0.16) to 0.60 (0.16) g/cm2, p = 0.011) in the teriparatide group increased. The change in BMD of the femoral neck (no medication; -0.002 (0.034) g/cm2, bisphosphonates; -0.0001 (0.024) g/cm2, and teriparatide; 0.017 (0.022) g/cm2, p = 0.091) or TBS (no medication; -0.007 (0.051), bisphosphonates; -0.058 (0.258), and teriparatide; 0.021 (0.044), p = 0.191) in the teriparatide group tended to be higher than that in the other groups, although there was no statistically significant difference. Conclusions: Teriparatide increased the BMD of the femoral neck and TBS in osteoporosis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, compared to bisphosphonates and no medication.",-1
The Role of Metalloproteinases and Their Tissue Inhibitors on Ocular Diseases: Focusing on Potential Mechanisms,"Eye diseases are associated with visual impairment, reduced quality of life, and may even lead to vision loss. The efficacy of available treatment of eye diseases is not satisfactory. The unique environment of the eye related to anatomical and physiological barriers and constraints limits the bioavailability of existing agents. In turn, complex ethiopathogenesis of ocular disorders that used drugs generally are non-disease specific and do not act causally. Therefore, there is a need for the development of a new therapeutic and preventive approach. It seems that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have a significant role in the development and progression of eye diseases and could be used in the therapy of these disorders as pharmacological targets. MMPs and TIMPs play an important role in the angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell invasion, and migration, which occur in ocular diseases. In this review, we aim to describe the participation of MMPs and TIMPs in the eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, and ocular cancers, posterior capsule opacification focusing on potential mechanisms.",-1
Prebiotic Supplementation During Gestation Induces a Tolerogenic Environment and a Protective Microbiota in Offspring Mitigating Food Allergy,"Food allergy is associated with alterations in the gut microbiota, epithelial barrier, and immune tolerance. These dysfunctions are observed within the first months of life, indicating that early intervention is crucial for disease prevention. Preventive nutritional strategies with prebiotics are an attractive option, as prebiotics such as galacto-oligosaccharides and inulin can promote tolerance, epithelial barrier reinforcement, and gut microbiota modulation. Nonetheless, the ideal period for intervention remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether galacto-oligosaccharide/inulin supplementation during gestation could protect offspring from wheat allergy development in BALB/cJRj mice. We demonstrated that gestational prebiotic supplementation promoted the presence of beneficial strains in the fecal microbiota of dams during gestation and partially during mid-lactation. This specific microbiota was transferred to their offspring and maintained to adulthood. The presence of B and T regulatory immune cell subsets was also increased in the lymph nodes of offspring born from supplemented mothers, suggestive of a more tolerogenic immune environment. Indeed, antenatal prebiotic supplementation reduced the development of wheat allergy symptoms in offspring. Our study thus demonstrates that prebiotic supplementation during pregnancy induces, in the offspring, a tolerogenic environment and a microbial imprint that mitigates food allergy development.",-1
"Crassolide Induces G2/M Cell Cycle Arrest, Apoptosis, and Autophagy in Human Lung Cancer Cells via ROS-Mediated ER Stress Pathways","Crassolide, a cembranoid diterpene extracted from the soft coral Lobophytum crissum, has been proven to possess antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties. In the present study, we assessed the anticancer effects of crassolide on human H460 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We found that crassolide exerted cytotoxic effects on H460 cancer cells in vitro, inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. In addition, in H460 cells exposed to crassolide, the expression of the autophagy-related proteins LC3-II and beclin was increased, while the expression of p62 was decreased. Moreover, inhibiting autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) suppressed the crassolide-induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis of H460 cells. Moreover, we also found that crassolide induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in lung cancer cells by increasing the expression of ER stress marker proteins and that the crassolide-induced G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy were markedly attenuated by the ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA). Furthermore, we found that crassolide promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by H460 cells and that the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased the crassolide-induced ER stress, G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. In conclusion, our findings show that crassolide inhibits NSCLC cell malignant biological behaviors for the first time, suggesting that this effect may be mechanistically achieved by inducing G2/M arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy through ROS accumulation, which activates the ER stress pathway. As a result of our findings, we now have a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the anticancer effect of crassolide, and we believe crassolide might be a candidate for targeted cancer therapy.",-1
Machine Learning-Based Prediction Models for Different Clinical Risks in Different Hospitals: Evaluation of Live Performance,"Background:                    Machine learning algorithms are currently used in a wide array of clinical domains to produce models that can predict clinical risk events. Most models are developed and evaluated with retrospective data, very few are evaluated in a clinical workflow, and even fewer report performances in different hospitals. In this study, we provide detailed evaluations of clinical risk prediction models in live clinical workflows for three different use cases in three different hospitals.              Objective:                    The main objective of this study was to evaluate clinical risk prediction models in live clinical workflows and compare their performance in these setting with their performance when using retrospective data. We also aimed at generalizing the results by applying our investigation to three different use cases in three different hospitals.              Methods:                    We trained clinical risk prediction models for three use cases (ie, delirium, sepsis, and acute kidney injury) in three different hospitals with retrospective data. We used machine learning and, specifically, deep learning to train models that were based on the Transformer model. The models were trained using a calibration tool that is common for all hospitals and use cases. The models had a common design but were calibrated using each hospital's specific data. The models were deployed in these three hospitals and used in daily clinical practice. The predictions made by these models were logged and correlated with the diagnosis at discharge. We compared their performance with evaluations on retrospective data and conducted cross-hospital evaluations.              Results:                    The performance of the prediction models with data from live clinical workflows was similar to the performance with retrospective data. The average value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) decreased slightly by 0.6 percentage points (from 94.8% to 94.2% at discharge). The cross-hospital evaluations exhibited severely reduced performance: the average AUROC decreased by 8 percentage points (from 94.2% to 86.3% at discharge), which indicates the importance of model calibration with data from the deployment hospital.              Conclusions:                    Calibrating the prediction model with data from different deployment hospitals led to good performance in live settings. The performance degradation in the cross-hospital evaluation identified limitations in developing a generic model for different hospitals. Designing a generic process for model development to generate specialized prediction models for each hospital guarantees model performance in different hospitals.",-1
Influence of inter-electrode distance on subthalamic nucleus local field potential recordings in Parkinson's disease,"Objectives:                    To evaluate spectra and their correlations with clinical symptoms of local field potentials (LFP) acquired from wide- and close-spaced contacts (i.e. between contacts 0-3 or LFP03, and contacts 1-2 or LFP12 respectively) on the same DBS electrode within the subthalamus (STN) in Parkinson's disease (PD), before and after levodopa administration.              Methods:                    LFP12 and LFP03 were recorded from 20 PD patients. We evaluated oscillatory power, local and switched phase-amplitude coupling (l- and Sw-PAC) and correlation with motor symptoms (UPDRSIII).              Results:                    Before levodopa, both LFP03 and LFP12 power in the Î± band inversely correlated with UPDRSIII. Differences between contacts were found in the low-frequency bands power. After levodopa, differences in UPDRSIII were associated to changes in LFP03 low-Î² and LFP12 HFO (high frequency oscillations, 250-350 Hz) power, while a modulation of the low-Î² power and an increased Î²-LFO (low frequency oscillations, 15-45 Hz) PAC was found only for LFP12.              Conclusion:                    This study reveals differences in spectral pattern between LFP12 and LFP03 before and after levodopa administration, as well as different correlations with PD motor symptoms.              Significance:                    Differences between LFP12 and LFP03 may offer an opportunity for optimizing adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) protocols for PD. LFP12 can be used to detect Î²-HFO coupling and Î² power (i.e. bradykinesia), while LFP03 are optimal for low frequency oscillations (dyskinesias).",-1
On-site multi-component intervention to improve productivity and reduce the economic and personal burden of neck pain in Swiss office-workers (NEXpro): protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Background:                    Non-specific neck pain and headache are major economic and individual burden in office-workers. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a multi-component intervention combining workstation ergonomics, health promotion information group workshops, neck exercises, and an app to enhance intervention adherence to assess possible reductions in the economic and individual burden of prevalent and incident neck pain and headache in office workers.              Methods/design:                    This study is a stepped wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants will be any office-worker aged 18-65 years from two Swiss organisations in the Cantons of Zurich and Aargau, working more than 25 h a week in predominantly sedentary office work and without serious health conditions of the neck. One hundred twenty voluntary participants will be assigned to 15 clusters which, at randomly selected time steps, switch from the control to the intervention group. The intervention will last 12 weeks and comprises workstation ergonomics, health promotion information group workshops, neck exercises and an adherence app. The primary outcome will be health-related productivity losses (presenteeism, absenteeism) using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are neck disability and pain (measured by the Neck Disability Index, and muscle strength and endurance measures), headache (measured by the short-form headache impact test), psychosocial outcomes (e.g. job-stress index, Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire), workplace outcomes (e.g. workstation ergonomics), adherence to intervention, and additional measures (e.g. care-seeking). Measurements will take place at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months after commencement. Data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis and per protocol. Primary and secondary outcomes will be examined using linear mixed-effects models.              Discussion:                    To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first that investigates the impact of a multi-component intervention combining current evidence of effective interventions with an adherence app to assess the potential benefits on productivity, prevalent and incident neck pain, and headache. The outcomes will impact the individual, their workplace, as well as private and public policy by offering evidence for treatment and prevention of neck pain and headache in office-workers.

"Association of Genetic Variants Related to Gluteofemoral vs Abdominal Fat Distribution With Type 2 Diabetes, Coronary Disease, and Cardiovascular Risk Factors","Importance:                    Body fat distribution, usually measured using waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), is an important contributor to cardiometabolic disease independent of body mass index (BMI). Whether mechanisms that increase WHR via lower gluteofemoral (hip) or via higher abdominal (waist) fat distribution affect cardiometabolic risk is unknown.              Objective:                    To identify genetic variants associated with higher WHR specifically via lower gluteofemoral or higher abdominal fat distribution and estimate their association with cardiometabolic risk.              Design, setting, and participants:                    Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for WHR combined data from the UK Biobank cohort and summary statistics from previous GWAS (data collection: 2006-2018). Specific polygenic scores for higher WHR via lower gluteofemoral or via higher abdominal fat distribution were derived using WHR-associated genetic variants showing specific association with hip or waist circumference. Associations of polygenic scores with outcomes were estimated in 3 population-based cohorts, a case-cohort study, and summary statistics from 6 GWAS (data collection: 1991-2018).              Exposures:                    More than 2.4 million common genetic variants (GWAS); polygenic scores for higher WHR (follow-up analyses).              Main outcomes and measures:                    BMI-adjusted WHR and unadjusted WHR (GWAS); compartmental fat mass measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, and coronary disease risk (follow-up analyses).              Results:                    Among 452 302 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, the mean (SD) age was 57 (8) years and the mean (SD) WHR was 0.87 (0.09). In genome-wide analyses, 202 independent genetic variants were associated with higher BMI-adjusted WHR (n = 660 648) and unadjusted WHR (n = 663 598). In dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry analyses (n = 18 330), the hip- and waist-specific polygenic scores for higher WHR were specifically associated with lower gluteofemoral and higher abdominal fat, respectively. In follow-up analyses (n = 636 607), both polygenic scores were associated with higher blood pressure and triglyceride levels and higher risk of diabetes (waist-specific score: odds ratio [OR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.34-1.83], absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years [ARI], 4.4 [95% CI, 2.7-6.5], P < .001; hip-specific score: OR, 2.54 [95% CI, 2.17-2.96], ARI, 12.0 [95% CI, 9.1-15.3], P < .001) and coronary disease (waist-specific score: OR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.39-1.84], ARI, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.5-3.3], P < .001; hip-specific score: OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.53-2.02], ARI, 3.0 [95% CI, 2.1-4.0], P < .001), per 1-SD increase in BMI-adjusted WHR.              Conclusions and relevance:                    Distinct genetic mechanisms may be linked to gluteofemoral and abdominal fat distribution that are the basis for the calculation of the WHR. These findings may improve risk assessment and treatment of diabetes and coronary disease.",-1
Bispecific Antibody-Based Immune-Cell Engagers and Their Emerging Therapeutic Targets in Cancer Immunotherapy,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide after cardiovascular diseases. Harnessing the power of immune cells is a promising strategy to improve the antitumor effect of cancer immunotherapy. Recent progress in recombinant DNA technology and antibody engineering has ushered in a new era of bispecific antibody (bsAb)-based immune-cell engagers (ICEs), including T- and natural-killer-cell engagers. Since the first approval of blinatumomab by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), various bsAb-based ICEs have been developed for the effective treatment of patients with cancer. Simultaneously, several potential therapeutic targets of bsAb-based ICEs have been identified in various cancers. Therefore, this review focused on not only highlighting the action mechanism, design and structure, and status of bsAb-based ICEs in clinical development and their approval by the US FDA for human malignancy treatment, but also on summarizing the currently known and emerging therapeutic targets in cancer. This review provides insights into practical considerations for developing next-generation ICEs.",-1
Identifying the oncogenic potential of gene fusions exploiting miRNAs,"It is estimated that oncogenic gene fusions cause about 20% of human cancer morbidity. Identifying potentially oncogenic gene fusions may improve affected patients' diagnosis and treatment. Previous approaches to this issue included exploiting specific gene-related information, such as gene function and regulation. Here we propose a model that profits from the previous findings and includes the microRNAs in the oncogenic assessment. We present ChimerDriver, a tool to classify gene fusions as oncogenic or not oncogenic. ChimerDriver is based on a specifically designed neural network and trained on genetic and post-transcriptional information to obtain a reliable classification. The designed neural network integrates information related to transcription factors, gene ontologies, microRNAs and other detailed information related to the functions of the genes involved in the fusion and the gene fusion structure. As a result, the performances on the test set reached 0.83 f1-score and 96% recall. The comparison with state-of-the-art tools returned comparable or higher results. Moreover, ChimerDriver performed well in a real-world case where 21 out of 24 validated gene fusion samples were detected by the gene fusion detection tool Starfusion. ChimerDriver integrates transcriptional and post-transcriptional information in an ad-hoc designed neural network to effectively discriminate oncogenic gene fusions from passenger ones. ChimerDriver source code is freely available at https://github.com/martalovino/ChimerDriver.",-1
Interleukin-17 programs liver progenitor cell transformation into cancer stem cells through miR-122 downregulation with increased risk of primary liver cancer initiation,"Chronic inflammation is a key component in the development of virtually all types of primary liver cancers. However, how chronic inflammation potentiates or even may initiate liver parenchymal cell transformation remains unclear. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent an exciting target for novel anticancer therapeutic strategies in several types of cancers and were also described in primary liver cancers as tumor initiating cells. Recently, we reported a key role of Interleukin (IL)-17 in Liver Progenitor Cell (LPC) accumulation in preneoplastic cirrhotic livers. In this study, we evidenced in vitro, that long-term stimulation of LPCs with IL-17 led to their transformation into CSCs. Indeed, they acquired CSC-marker expression, and self-renewal properties, showed by their increased capacity to form spheroids. The miRNome analysis revealed that long-term IL-17 treatment of LPCs led to a 90% decrease in miR-122 expression. In a model using immunodeficient mice, ectopic engraftment of LPCs in an IL-17-enriched environment led to tumor occurrence with an aggressive phenotype. Contrastingly, in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma induced by a unique injection of diethyl-nitrosamine associated with chronic administration of carbon tetrachloride, IL-17-deficiency or anti-IL-17 therapy protected mice from liver tumor growth. In conclusion, we showed that a chronic exposure of LPCs to IL-17 cytokine promotes their transformation into CSCs. In addition, we demonstrated that IL-17-neutralizing strategies limit CSC occurrence and liver tumor progression through miR-122 restored-expression.",-1
[How do children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak?],"Objectives:                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government has decided a general lockdown. This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France.              Methods:                    We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) ""How is your child doing since the lockdown?"" 2) ""How is life at home since the lockdown?"" 3) ""If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us"" 4) ""Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation"". This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey.              Results:                    Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71 % (95 % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33 % (95 % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96 % (95 % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions.              Conclusions:                    According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being. An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions.",-1
"""Maskandi experience"": exploring the use of a cultural song for community engagement in preparation for a pilot Sterile Insect Technique release programme for malaria vector control in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa 2019","Background:                    An assessment of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) as a complementary malaria vector control tool, is at an advanced stage in South Africa. The technique involves the release of laboratory-reared sterilized male mosquitoes of the major malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis, raising social, ethical and regulatory concerns. Therefore, its implementation largely depends on community participation and acceptance. Against this background, it is critical that robust and effective community strategies are developed. This study describes the development of a cultural song to engage the community and increase awareness on SIT and malaria control in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.              Methods:                    An exploratory concurrent mixed-methods study was conducted to get opinions about the effectiveness of a cultural song developed to engage communities and increase acceptability of the SIT technology. Two self-administered surveys (expert and community) were conducted. Additionally, more in depth opinions of the song and its effectiveness in conveying the intended information were investigated through three community dialogue sessions with community members in the study area.              Results:                    A total of 40 experts and 54 community members participated in the survey. Four themes were identified in relation to the appropriateness and effectiveness of the song, with a fifth theme focused on recommendations for adaptations. Overall, the song was well received with the audience finding it entertaining and informative. Responses to unstructured questions posed after the song showed an increase in the knowledge on malaria transmission and SIT technology. In particular, the explanation that male mosquitoes do not bite allayed anxiety and fears about the SIT technology.              Conclusion:                    The song was deemed both culturally appropriate and informative in engaging community members about the SIT technology. It proved useful in promoting health messages and conveying SIT technology as a complementary malaria vector control tool. With minor adaptations, the song has potential as an area-wide community engagement tool in areas targeted for sterile male releases.",-1
How expertise and language familiarity influence perception of speech of people with Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by several motor and non-motor manifestations. PD frequently leads to hypokinetic dysarthria, which affects speech production and often has a detrimental impact on everyday communication. Among the typical manifestations of hypokinetic dysarthria, speech and language therapists (SLTs) identify prosody as the most affected cluster of speech characteristics. However, less is known about how untrained listeners perceive PD speech and how affected prosody influences their assessments of speech. This study explores the perception of sentence type intonation and healthiness of PD speech by listeners with different levels of familiarity with speech disorders in Dutch. We investigated assessments and classification accuracy differences between Dutch-speaking SLTs (n = 18) and Dutch/non-Dutch speaking untrained listeners (n = 27 and n = 124, respectively). We collected speech data from 30 Dutch speakers diagnosed with PD and 30 Dutch healthy controls. The stimuli set consisted of short phrases from spontaneous and read speech and of phrases produced with different sentence type intonation. Listeners participated in an online experiment targeting classification of sentence type intonation and perceived healthiness of speech. Results indicate that both familiarity with speech disorders and with speakers' language are significant and have different effects depending on the task type, as different listener groups demonstrate different classification accuracy. There is evidence that untrained Dutch listeners classify PD speech as unhealthy more accurately than both trained Dutch and untrained non-Dutch listeners, while trained Dutch listeners outperform the other two groups in sentence type classification.",-1
Insects and SARS-CoV-2: Analysis of the Potential Role of Vectors in European Countries,"SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus responsible for the pandemic that developed in China in late 2019. Transmission of the virus is predominantly direct, through exposure to infected respiratory secretions. As far as we know, arthropods play a key role in the transmission and spread of several viruses, and thus their role in the spread of COVID-19 deserves to be studied. The biological transmission of viral agents through insects is very complex. While mechanical transmission is more likely to happen, biological transmission is possible via blood-sucking arthropods, but this requires a high grade of compatibility between the vector and the pathogen. If the biological and mechanical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blood-sucking arthropods is excluded, a mechanical transmission by urban pests could take place. This risk is very low but it could be important in isolated environmental conditions, where other means of transmission are not possible. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in non-blood-sucking arthropods in infected buildings, like hospitals and retirement homes, should be investigated.",-1
Clinical Trials of Microsurgery for Cerebral Aneurysms: Past and Future,"Background:                    New findings and research regarding the microsurgical treatment of intracerebral aneurysms (IAs) continue to advance even in the era of endovascular therapies. Research in the past 2 decades has continued to revolve around the question of whether open surgery or endovascular treatment is preferable. The answer remains both complex and in flux.              Objective:                    This review focuses on microsurgery, reflects on the research decisions of previous landmark studies, and proposes future study designs that may further our understanding of IAs and how best to treat them.              Results:                    The future of IA research may include a combination of pragmatic trials, artificial intelligence integrated tools, and mining of large data sets, in addition to the publication of high-quality single-center studies.              Conclusions:                    The future will likely emphasize testing innovative techniques, looking at granular patient data, and considering every patient encounter as a potential source of knowledge, creating a system in which data are updated daily because each patient interaction contributes to answering important research questions.",-1
Continuous-time probabilistic models for longitudinal electronic health records,"Analysis of longitudinal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is an important goal for precision medicine. Difficulty in applying Machine Learning (ML) methods, either predictive or unsupervised, stems in part from the heterogeneity and irregular sampling of EHR data. We present an unsupervised probabilistic model that captures nonlinear relationships between variables over continuous-time. This method works with arbitrary sampling patterns and captures the joint probability distribution between variable measurements and the time intervals between them. Inference algorithms are derived that can be used to evaluate the likelihood of future using under a trained model. As an example, we consider data from the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in the areas of diabetes and depression. Likelihood ratio maps are produced showing the likelihood of risk for moderate-severe vs minimal depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).",-1
Cost-Effectiveness and Return-on-Investment of the Dynamic Work Intervention Compared With Usual Practice to Reduce Sedentary Behavior,"Objective:                    To assess the cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment (ROI) of the Dynamic Work (DW) Intervention, a worksite intervention aimed at reducing sitting time among office workers.              Methods:                    In total, 244 workers were randomized to the intervention or control group. Overall sitting time, standing time, step counts, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs were measured over 12 months. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective and the ROI analysis from the employers' perspective.              Results:                    No significant differences in effects and societal costs were observed between groups. Presenteeism costs were significantly lower in the intervention group. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.90 at a willingness-to-pay of 20,000&OV0556;/QALY. The probability of financial savings was 0.86.              Conclusion:                    The intervention may be considered cost-effective from the societal perspective depending on the willingness-to-pay. From the employer perspective, the intervention seems cost-beneficial.",-1
Comparing prognostic value of preoperative platelet indexes in patients with resectable gastric cancer,"The ratio of mean platelet volume (MPV) to count (PC) (MPV/PC) has been applied in the diagnosis and prognosis of various malignancies. However, the prognostic value of MPV/PC in gastric cancer has not been studied yet. This study aims to explore the prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), combined neutrophil-platelet score (CNPS), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and MPV/PC in patients with resectable gastric cancer. In this study, the medical records of patients with gastric cancer in two centers were retrospectively analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank were tests applied to analyze the survival differences of patients with various inflammation indexes. A nomogram prognostic model was established to predict the 3- and 5-year survival rate of patients with resectable gastric cancer. In the two cohorts, Kaplan-Meier analysis that the postoperative survival time of gastric cancer patients with low MPV/PC, high NLR, high PLR and high SII was significantly shorter than that of patients with high MPV/PC, low NLR, low PLR or low SII. Compared with NLR, PLR, SII and CNPS, MPV/PC was more accurate in determining the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer than other indexes, and multivariate analysis confirmed that MPV/PC was an independent prognostic factor for patients with resectable gastric cancer. The nomogram model established based on tumor size, TNM stage and MPV/PC was more accurate than TNM stage in predicting the 3- and 5-year survival rate of patients with resectable gastric cancer. Preoperative MPV/PC is a new independent prognostic index and a potential marker for treatment response monitoring in patients with resectable gastric cancer. The nomogram model for postoperative prognosis of gastric cancer established based on MPV/PC, tumor size and TNM stage is helpful for developing more accurate and timely individualized therapeutic regimens.",-1
Temporal Relation Extraction with Joint Semantic and Syntactic Attention,"Determining the temporal relationship between events has always been a challenging natural language understanding task. Previous research mainly relies on neural networks to learn effective features or artificial language features to extract temporal relationships, which usually fails when the context between two events is complex or extensive. In this paper, we propose our JSSA (Joint Semantic and Syntactic Attention) model, a method that combines both coarse-grained information from semantic level and fine-grained information from syntactic level. We utilize neighbor triples of events on syntactic dependency trees and events triple to construct syntactic attention served as clue information and prior guidance for analyzing the context information. The experiment results on TB-Dense and MATRES datasets have proved the effectiveness of our ideas.",-1
Performance of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry to Determine the Sex of Mosquitoes and Identify Specific Colonies from French Polynesia,"Mosquitoes are the main arthropod vectors of human pathogens. The current methods for mosquito identification include morphological and molecular methods. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), now routinely used for bacterial identification, has recently emerged in the field of entomology. The aim of this study was to use MALDI-TOF MS to identify mosquito colonies from French Polynesia. Five hundred specimens from French Polynesia belonging to three species, Aedes aegypti, Aedes polynesiensis, and Culex quinquefasciatus, were included in the study. Testing the legs of these mosquitoes by MALDI-TOF MS revealed a 100% correct identification of all specimens at the species level. The MALDI-TOF MS profiles obtained allowed differentiation of male from female mosquitoes and the specific identification of female mosquito colonies of the same species but different geographic origin.",-1
Postural and gait symptoms in de novo Parkinson's disease patients correlate with cholinergic white matter pathology,"Introduction:                    The postural instability gait difficulty motor subtype of patients with Parkinson's disease (PIGD-PD) has been associated with more severe cognitive pathology and a higher risk on dementia compared to the tremor-dominant subtype (TD-PD). Here, we investigated whether the microstructural integrity of the cholinergic projections from the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) was different between these clinical subtypes.              Methods:                    Diffusion-weighted imaging data of 98 newly-diagnosed unmedicated PD patients (44 TD-PD and 54 PIGD-PD subjects) and 10 healthy controls, were analysed using diffusion tensor imaging, focusing on the white matter tracts associated with cholinergic projections from the NBM (NBM-WM) as the tract-of-interest. Quantitative tract-based and voxel-based analyses were performed using FA and MD as the estimates of white matter integrity.              Results:                    Voxel-based analyses indicated significantly lower FA in the frontal part of the medial and lateral NBM-WM tract of both hemispheres of PIGD-PD compared to TD-PD. Relative to healthy control, several clusters with significantly lower FA were observed in the frontolateral NBM-WM tract of both disease groups. Furthermore, significant correlations between the severity of the axial and gait impairment and NBM-WM FA and MD were found, which were partially mediated by NBM-WM state on subjects' attentional performance.              Conclusions:                    The PIGD-PD subtype shows a loss of microstructural integrity of the NBM-WM tract, which suggests that a loss of cholinergic projections in this PD subtype already presents in de novo PD patients.",-1
Non-coding RNAs in Kawasaki disease: Molecular mechanisms and clinical implications,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limiting vasculitis with coronary complications, usually occurring in children. The incidence of KD in children is increasing year by year, mainly in East Asian countries, but relatively stably in Europe and America. Although studies on KD have been reported, the pathogenesis of KD is unknown. With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, growing number of regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) including microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA) have been identified to involved in KD. However, the role of ncRNAs in KD has not been comprehensively elucidated. Therefore, it is significative to study the regulatory role of ncRNA in KD, which might help to uncover new and effective therapeutic strategies for KD. In this review, we summarize recent studies on ncRNA in KD from the perspectives of immune disorders, inflammatory disorders, and endothelial dysfunction, and highlight the potential of ncRNAs as therapeutic targets for KD.",-1
Dietary Acid Load Modulation of Asthma-Related miRNAs in the Exhaled Breath Condensate of Children,"Individual nutrients and bioactive compounds have been implicated in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are related to inflammation and asthma. However, evidence about the impact of diet is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to assess the association between dietary acid load and asthma-related miRNA in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of school-aged children. This cross-sectional analysis included 150 participants aged 7 to 12 years (52% girls) from a nested case-control study, which randomly selected 186 children attending 71 classrooms from 20 public schools located in city of Porto, Portugal. Dietary data were collected by one 24 h-recall questionnaire. Dietary acid load was assessed using the potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) scores. Based on previous studies, eleven asthma-related miRNAs were chosen and analyzed in EBC by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR. PRAL, NEAP and miRNAs were categorized as high or low according to the median. Logistic regression models were performed to assess the association between dietary acid load scores and miRNAs. Children in high dietary acid load groups (PRAL â?14.43 and NEAP â?55.79 mEq/day) have significantly increased odds of having high miR-133a-3p levels. In conclusion, higher dietary acid loads possibly modulate asthma-related miRNAs of school-aged children.",-1
The Gut Microbial Signature of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and the Association With Diet Intervention,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a high-risk pregnancy complication that is associated with metabolic disorder phenotypes, such as abnormal blood glucose and obesity. The link between microbiota and diet management contributes to metabolic homeostasis in GDM. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the structure of the gut microbiota in GDM and to explore the effect of dietary management on the microbiota structure. In this study, we analyzed the composition of the gut microbiota between 27 GDM and 30 healthy subjects at two time points using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The taxonomy analyses suggested that the overall bacteria clustered by diabetes status, rather than diet intervention. Of particular interest, the phylum Acidobacteria in GDM was significantly increased, and positively correlated with blood glucose levels. Moreover, Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that certain genera in the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Lentisphaerae characterized the GDM gut microbiota. Correlation analysis indicated that blood glucose levels and BMI index were correlated with the relative abundance of SCFAS-producing genera. Through the comparison between the GDM and healthy samples with or without diet intervention, we discovered that the role of short-term diet management in GDM processes is associated with the change in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and some specific taxa, rather than an alternative gut microbial pattern. Our study have important implications for understanding the beneficial effects of diet intervention on the specific gut microbiota and thus possibly their metabolism in pregnant women with GDM.",-1
The new Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 diagnostic tool clarifies the taxonomic position and geographic distribution of the North American malaria vector Anopheles punctipennis,"Background:                    The malaria mosquito Anopheles punctipennis, a widely distributed species in North America, is capable of transmitting human malaria and is actively involved in the transmission of the ungulate malaria parasite Plasmodium odocoilei. However, molecular diagnostic tools based on Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA are lacking for this species. Anopheles punctipennis is a former member of the Anopheles maculipennis complex but its systematic position remains unclear.              Methods:                    In this study, ITS2 sequences were obtained from 276 An. punctipennis specimens collected in the eastern and midwestern United States and a simple and robust Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism approach for species identification was developed. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed based on ITS2 sequences available through this study and from GenBank for 20 species of Anopheles.              Results:                    The analysis demonstrated a consistent ITS2 sequence length and showed no indications of intragenomic variation among the samples based on ITS2, suggesting that An. punctipennis represents a single species in the studied geographic locations. In this study, An. punctipennis was found in urban, rural, and forest settings, suggesting its potential broad role in pathogen transmission. Phylogeny based on ITS2 sequence comparison demonstrated the close relationship of this species with other members of the Maculipennis group.              Conclusions:                    This study developed molecular tools based on ITS2 sequences for the malaria vector An. punctipennis and clarified the phylogenetic position of the species within the Maculipennis group.",-1
Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals,"Background:                    The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients.              Challenges:                    The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management.              Purpose:                    This commentary aims to summarise some of the potential mental health and psychosocial challenges that may arise in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.",-1
County-Level Records for Culex stigmatosoma and Culex thriambus in Texas,"Populations of Culex stigmatosoma and Cx. thriambus have been documented in the southwestern USA with a southward range extension to northern South America and Central America, respectively. Studies conducted in California indicate both species are potential vectors of West Nile virus. However, vector competence studies are lacking for other parts of the USA. During a multicounty regional surveillance study west of San Antonio, Texas, multiple errors were observed in the Texas distributional literature of these species. These errors involved incorrect distributional information in Texas and US publications. Evidence to correct these errant records was found upon further analysis of Texas literature and curated specimens. Therefore, the aims of this study were to present that evidence and then combine the corrected records with additional records from the Texas Department of State Health Services and from larval collections made during other Texas surveillance studies.",-1
SARS-CoV-2 triggering autoimmune diseases,"Autoimmunity, hyperstimulation of the immune system, can be caused by a variety of reasons. Viruses are thought to be important environmental elements that contribute to the development of autoimmune antibodies. It seems that viruses cause autoimmunity with mechanisms such as molecular mimicry, bystander activation of T cells, transient immunosuppression, and inflammation, which has also been seen in post-Covid-19 autoimmunity. Infection of respiratory epithelium by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dysregulates the immune response, triggers both innate and acquired immunity that led to the immune system's hyperactivation, excessive cytokine secretion known as ""cytokine storm,"" and finally acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with high mortality. Any factor in the body that triggers chronic inflammation can contribute to autoimmune disease, which has been documented during the Covid-19 pandemic. It has been observed that some patients produce autoantibody and autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, leading to the loss of self-tolerance. However, there is a scarcity of evidence defining the precise molecular interaction between the virus and the immune system to elicit autoreactivity. Here, we present a review of the relevant immunological findings in Covid-19 and the current reports of autoimmune disease associated with the disease.",-1
miRNA signatures associated with vulnerability to food addiction in mice and humans,"Food addiction is characterized by a loss of behavioral control over food intake and is associated with obesity and other eating disorders. The mechanisms underlying this behavioral disorder are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the changes in miRNA expression promoted by food addiction in animals and humans and their involvement in the mechanisms underlying the behavioral hallmarks of this disorder. We found sharp similitudes between miRNA signatures in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of our animal cohort and circulating miRNA levels in our human cohort, which allowed us to identify several miRNAs of potential interest in the development of this disorder. Tough decoy (TuD) inhibition of miRNA-29c-3p in the mouse mPFC promoted persistence of the response and enhanced vulnerability to developing food addiction, whereas miRNA-665-3p inhibition promoted compulsion-like behavior and also enhanced food addiction vulnerability. In contrast, we found that miRNA-137-3p inhibition in the mPFC did not lead to the development of food addiction. Therefore, miRNA-29c-3p and miRNA-665-3p could be acting as protective factors with regard to food addiction. We believe the elucidation of these epigenetic mechanisms will lead to advances toward identifying innovative biomarkers and possible future interventions for food addiction and related disorders based on the strategies now available to modify miRNA activity and expression.",-1
MiR-183-5p Induced by Saturated Fatty Acids Hinders Insulin Signaling by Downregulating IRS-1 in Hepatocytes,"Excessive saturated fatty acids (SFA) uptake is known to be a primary cause of obesity, a widely acknowledged risk factor of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Although specific microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting insulin signaling intermediates are dysregulated by SFA, their effects on insulin signaling and sensitivity are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of SFA-induced miR-183-5p in the regulation of proximal insulin signaling molecules and the development of hepatic insulin resistance. HepG2 hepatocytes treated with palmitate and the livers of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice exhibited impaired insulin signaling resulting from dramatic reductions in the protein expressions of insulin receptor (INSR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Differential expression analysis showed the level of miR-183-5p, which tentatively targets the 3'UTR of IRS-1, was significantly elevated in palmitate-treated HepG2 hepatocytes and the livers of HFD-fed mice. Dual-luciferase analysis showed miR-183-5p bound directly to the 3'UTR of IRS-1 and reduced IRS-1 expression at the post-transcriptional stage. Moreover, transfection of HepG2 hepatocytes with miR-183-5p mimic significantly inhibited IRS-1 expression and hindered insulin signaling, consequently inhibiting insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. Collectively, this study reveals a novel mechanism whereby miR-183-5p induction by SFA impairs insulin signaling and suggests miR-183-5p plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance in the background of obesity.",-1
"Testing for gestational diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. An evaluation of proposed protocols for the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia","Aims:                    We assessed how altered diagnostic processes and criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) recommended by the United Kingdom (UK), Canada and Australia for use during the COVID-19 pandemic would affect both GDM frequency and related adverse outcomes.              Methods:                    Secondary analysis of 5974 HAPO study women with singleton pregnancies who underwent 75 g OGTTs and HbA1c assays between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation and who received no treatment for GDM.              Results:                    All post COVID-19 modified pathways reduced GDM frequency - UK (81%), Canada (82%) and Australia (25%). Canadian women whose GDM would remain undetected post COVID-19 (missed GDMs) displayed similar rates of pregnancy complications to those with post COVID-19 GDM. Using UK modifications, the missed GDM group were at slightly lower risk whilst the women missed using the Australian modifications were at substantially lower risk.              Conclusions:                    The modifications in GDM diagnosis proposed for the UK, Canada and Australia result in differing reductions of GDM frequency. Each has both potential benefits in terms of reduction in potential exposure to COVID-19 and costs in terms of missed opportunities to influence pregnancy and postpartum outcomes. These factors should be considered when deciding which protocol is most appropriate for a particular context.",-1
[Role of adipose tissue in the development and progression of colorectal cancer],"The paper gives the current data available in the literature on the relationship and pathogenetic mechanisms of influence of adipose tissue on colorectal carcinogenesis. It considers the aspects of changes in adipose tissue and microenvironment of the tumor itself, including those under the influence of biologically active substances secreted by adipocytes; differences in subcutaneous and visceral fat and their importance in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), as well as the role of adipose tissue-derived stem cells. Understanding these mechanisms for adipose tissue influence on CRC will assist not only in preventing this disease, but also in searching for new therapeutic targets.",-1
Genome-Wide Transcriptional Analysis and Functional Validation Linked a Cluster of Epsilon Glutathione S-Transferases with Insecticide Resistance in the Major Malaria Vector Anopheles funestus across Africa,"Resistance is threatening the effectiveness of insecticide-based interventions in use for malaria control. Pinpointing genes associated with resistance is crucial for evidence-based resistance management targeting the major malaria vectors. Here, a combination of RNA-seq based genome-wide transcriptional analysis and RNA-silencing in vivo functional validation were used to identify key insecticide resistance genes associated with DDT and DDT/permethrin cross-resistance across Africa. A cluster of glutathione-S-transferase from epsilon group were found to be overexpressed in resistant populations of Anopheles funestus across Africa including GSTe1 [Cameroon (fold change, FC: 2.54), Ghana (4.20), Malawi (2.51)], GSTe2 [Cameroon (4.47), Ghana (7.52), Malawi (2.13)], GSTe3 [Cameroon (2.49), Uganda (2.60)], GSTe4 in Ghana (3.47), GSTe5 [Ghana (2.94), Malawi (2.26)], GSTe6 [Cameroun (3.0), Ghana (3.11), Malawi (3.07), Uganda (3.78)] and GSTe7 (2.39) in Ghana. Validation of GSTe genes expression profiles by qPCR confirmed that the genes are differentially expressed across Africa with a greater overexpression in DDT-resistant mosquitoes. RNAi-based knock-down analyses supported that five GSTe genes are playing a major role in resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) and DDT in An. funestus, with a significant recovery of susceptibility observed when GSTe2, 3, 4, 5 and GSTe6 were silenced. These findings established that GSTe3, 4, 5 and 6 contribute to DDT resistance and should be further characterized to identify their specific genetic variants, to help design DNA-based diagnostic assays, as previously done for the 119F-GSTe2 mutation. This study highlights the role of GSTes in the development of resistance to insecticides in malaria vectors and calls for actions to mitigate this resistance.",-1
PINK1 kinase dysfunction triggers neurodegeneration in the primate brain without impacting mitochondrial homeostasis,"In vitro studies have established the prevalent theory that the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 protects neurodegeneration by removing damaged mitochondria in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, difficulty in detecting endogenous PINK1 protein in rodent brains and cell lines has prevented the rigorous investigation of the in vivo role of PINK1. Here we report that PINK1 kinase form is selectively expressed in the human and monkey brains. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deficiency of PINK1 causes similar neurodegeneration in the brains of fetal and adult monkeys as well as cultured monkey neurons without affecting mitochondrial protein expression and morphology. Importantly, PINK1 mutations in the primate brain and human cells reduce protein phosphorylation that is important for neuronal function and survival. Our findings suggest that PINK1 kinase activity rather than its mitochondrial function is essential for the neuronal survival in the primate brains and that its kinase dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of PD.",-1
Decoding Pixel-Level Image Features From Two-Photon Calcium Signals of Macaque Visual Cortex,"Images of visual scenes comprise essential features important for visual cognition of the brain. The complexity of visual features lies at different levels, from simple artificial patterns to natural images with different scenes. It has been a focus of using stimulus images to predict neural responses. However, it remains unclear how to extract features from neuronal responses. Here we address this question by leveraging two-photon calcium neural data recorded from the visual cortex of awake macaque monkeys. With stimuli including various categories of artificial patterns and diverse scenes of natural images, we employed a deep neural network decoder inspired by image segmentation technique. Consistent with the notation of sparse coding for natural images, a few neurons with stronger responses dominated the decoding performance, whereas decoding of ar tificial patterns needs a large number of neurons. When natural images using the model pretrained on artificial patterns are decoded, salient features of natural scenes can be extracted, as well as the conventional category information. Altogether, our results give a new perspective on studying neural encoding principles using reverse-engineering decoding strategies.",-1
Effects of autophagy modulators tamoxifen and chloroquine on the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs in MIAMI cells exposed to IFNÎ³,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can be utilized clinically for treatment of conditions that result from excessive inflammation. In a pro-inflammatory environment, MSCs adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype resulting in immunomodulation. A sub-type of MSCs referred to as ""marrow-isolated adult multilineage inducible"" (MIAMI) cells, which were isolated from bone marrow, were utilized to show that the addition of autophagy modulators, tamoxifen (TX) or chloroquine (CQ), can alter how MIAMI cells respond to IFNÎ³ exposure in vitro resulting in an increased immunoregulatory capacity of the MIAMI cells. Molecularly, it was also shown that TX and CQ each alter both the levels of immunomodulatory genes and microRNAs which target such genes. However, the role of other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating the response of MSCs to inflammation has been poorly studied. Here, we utilized transcriptomics and data mining to analyze the putative roles of various differentially regulated lncRNAs in MIAMI cells exposed to IFNÎ³ with (or without) TX or CQ. The aim of this study was to investigate how the addition of TX and CQ alters lncRNA levels and evaluate how such changes could alter previously observed TX- and CQ-driven changes to the immunomodulatory properties of MIAMI cells. Data analysis revealed 693 long intergenic non-coding RNAS (lincRNAs), 480 pseudogenes, and 642 antisense RNAs that were differentially regulated with IFNÎ³, IFNÎ³+TX and IFNÎ³+CQ treatments. Further analysis of these RNA species based on the existing literature data revealed 6 antisense RNAs, 2 pseudogenes, and 5 lincRNAs that have the potential to modulate MIAMI cell's response to IFNÎ³ treatment. Functional analysis of these genomic species based on current literature linking inflammatory response and ncRNAs indicated their potential for regulation of several key pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, including NFÎºB signaling, cytokine secretion and auto-immune responses. Overall, this work found potential involvement of multiple pro-and anti-inflammatory pathways and molecules in modulating MIAMI cells' response to inflammation.",-1
Neuroinflammation associated with ultrasound-mediated permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) continues to represent one of the most significant challenges for successful drug-based treatments of neurological disease. Mechanical modulation of the BBB using focused ultrasound (FUS) and microbubbles (MBs) has shown considerable promise in enhancing the delivery of therapeutics to the brain, but questions remain regarding possible long-term effects of such forced disruption. This review examines the evidence for inflammation associated with ultrasound-induced BBB disruption and potential strategies for managing such inflammatory effects to improve both the efficacy and safety of therapeutic ultrasound in neurological applications.",-1
"Effects of Dietary Phospholipids on Growth Performance, Digestive Enzymes Activity and Intestinal Health of Largemouth Bass ( Micropterus salmoides) Larvae","While the beneficial roles of dietary phospholipids on health status and overall performances of fish larvae have been well demonstrated, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To address this gap, the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary phospholipids on growth performance, intestinal development, immune response and microbiota of larval largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Five isonitrogenous and isolipidic micro-diets were formulated to contain graded inclusion levels of phospholipids (1.69, 3.11, 5.23, 7.43 and 9.29%). Results showed that the supplementation of dietary phospholipids linearly improved the growth performance of largemouth bass larvae. The inclusion of dietary phospholipids increased the activity of digestive enzymes, such as lipase, trypsin and alkaline phosphatase, and promoted the expression of tight junction proteins including ZO-1, claudin-4 and claudin-5. Additionally, dietary phospholipids inclusion alleviated the accumulation of intestinal triacylglycerols, and further elevated the activity of lysozyme. Dietary phospholipids inhibited the transcription of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, including il-1Î², and tnf-Î±, but promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines tgf-Î², with these modifications being suggested to be mediated by the p38MAPK/Nf-ÎºB pathway. The analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA V3-4 region indicated that the intestinal microbiota profile was significantly altered at the genus level with dietary phospholipids inclusion, including a decreased richness of pathogenic bacteria genera Klebsiella in larval intestine. In summary, it was showed that largemouth bass larvae have a specific requirement for dietary phospholipids, and this study provided novel insights on how dietary phospholipids supplementation contributes to improving the growth performance, digestive tract development and intestinal health.",-1
Design of the Advancing Care for Type 1 Diabetes and Obesity Network energy metabolism and sequential multiple assignment randomized trial nutrition pilot studies: An integrated approach to develop weight management solutions for individuals with type 1 diabetes,"Young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often have difficulty co-managing weight and glycemia. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among individuals with T1D now parallels that of the general population and contributes to dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and risk for cardiovascular disease. There is a compelling need to develop a program of research designed to optimize two key outcomes-weight management and glycemia-and to address the underlying metabolic processes and behavioral challenges unique to people with T1D. For an intervention addressing these dual outcomes to be effective, it must be appropriate to the unique metabolic phenotype of T1D, and to biological and behavioral responses to glycemia (including hypoglycemia) that relate to weight management. The intervention must also be safe, feasible, and accepted by young adults with T1D. In 2015, we established a consortium called ACT1ON: Advancing Care for Type 1 Diabetes and Obesity Network, a transdisciplinary team of scientists at multiple institutions. The ACT1ON consortium designed a multi-phase study which, in parallel, evaluated the mechanistic aspects of the unique metabolism and energy requirements of individuals with T1D, alongside a rigorous adaptive behavioral intervention to simultaneously facilitate weight management while optimizing glycemia. This manuscript describes the design of our integrative study-comprised of an inpatient mechanistic phase and an outpatient behavioral phase-to generate metabolic, behavioral, feasibility, and acceptability data to support a future, fully powered sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial to evaluate the best approaches to prevent and treat obesity while co-managing glycemia in people with T1D.

Body Composition and Acquired Functional Impairment in Survivors of Pediatric Critical Illness,"Objectives:                    To identify whether body mass and composition is associated with acquired functional impairment in PICU survivors.              Design:                    Retrospective dual-cohort study.              Setting:                    Single multidisciplinary PICU.              Patients:                    Two distinct PICU survivor cohorts: 432 unselected admissions from April 2015 to March 2016, and separately 92 patients with abdominal CT imaging at admission from January 2010 to December 2016.              Interventions:                    None.              Measurements and main results:                    Admission body mass index and Functional Status Scale scores at admission, PICU discharge, and hospital discharge were obtained for all patients. Acquired functional impairment was defined as increase greater than or equal to 3 in Functional Status Scale from baseline. Patients were classified as having: ""temporary acquired impairment"" (acquired impairment at PICU discharge recovering by hospital discharge), ""persistent acquired impairment"" (acquired impairment at PICU discharge persisting to hospital discharge), and ""no acquired impairment."" CT scans were analyzed for skeletal muscle and fat area using National Institute of Health ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify associations between body mass index, muscle and fat indices, and acquired functional impairment. High baseline body mass index was consistently predictive of persistent acquired impairment in both cohorts. In the second cohort, when body mass index was replaced with radiologic anthropometric measurements, greater skeletal muscle, and visceral adipose tissue indices were independently associated with persistent acquired impairment at hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.61; p = 0.024 and adjusted odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28; p = 0.042, respectively). However, this relationship was no longer significant in children with PICU stay greater than 2 days.              Conclusions:                    In PICU survivors, baseline body mass and composition may play a role in the persistence of acquired functional impairment at hospital discharge. Characterization and quantification of skeletal muscle and fat deserves further study in larger cohorts of PICU children.",-1
Robust host source tracking building on the divergent and non-stochastic assembly of gut microbiomes in wild and farmed large yellow croaker,"Background:                    Given the lack of genetic background, the source tracking unknown individuals of fish species with both farmed and wild populations often cannot be robustly achieved. The gut microbiome, which is shaped by both deterministic and stochastic processes, can serve as a molecular marker of fish host source tracking, particularly as an alternative to the yet-to-be-established host genetic marker. A candidate for testing the feasibility is the large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea, which is carnivorous and ranks the top mariculture fish in China. Wild resource of this fish was depleted decades ago and might have potential problematic estimation because of escaping of farmed individuals.              Results:                    The rectums of wild (n = 212) and farmed (n = 79) croakers from multiple batches were collected for the profiling of their gut bacterial communities. The farmed individuals had a higher alpha diversity and lower bacterial load than the wild individuals. The gut microbiota of the two sources exhibited divergence and high inter-batch variation, as featured by the dominance of Psychrobacter spp. in the wild group. Predicted functional capacity of the gut microbiome and representative isolates showed differences in terms of host source. This difference can be linked to the potential diet divergence between farmed and wild fishes. The non-stochastic distribution pattern of the core gut microbiota of the wild and farmed individuals supports the feasibility of microbiota-based host source tracking via the machine learning algorithm. A random forest classifier based on the divergence and non-stochastic assembly of the gut microbiome was robust in terms of host source tracking the individuals from all batches of croaker, including a newly introduced batch.              Conclusions:                    Our study revealed the divergence of gut microbiota and related functional profiles between wild and farmed croakers. For the first time, with representative datasets and non-stochastic patterns, we have verified that gut microbiota can be robustly applied to the tracking of host source even in carnivorous fish.

Gender Differences Between the Phenotype of Short Stature and the Risk of Diabetes Mellitus in Chinese Adults: A Population-Based Cohort Study,"Objective:                    Previous studies have shown that there are significant regional and gender differences in the association between the phenotype of short stature and diabetes mellitus (DM). The purpose of this study was to investigate the gender difference between the phenotype of short stature and the risk of DM in the Chinese population.              Methods:                    The sample included 116,661 adults from 32 locations of 11 cities in China, of which the average height of men and women was 171.65 and 160.06 cm, respectively. Investigators retrospectively reviewed annual physical examination results for follow-up observations and set confirmed DM events as the outcome of interest. Multivariate Cox regression, restricted cubic spline, and piecewise regression models were used to check the association between height and DM risk.              Results:                    During an average observation period of 3.1 years, there were 2,681 of 116,661 participants who developed new-onset DM, with a male to female ratio of 2.4 to 1. After full adjustment for confounders, we confirmed that there was a significant negative correlation between height and DM risk in Chinese women (HR per 10 cm increase: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.98), but not in men (HR per 10 cm increase: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.98-1.14). Additionally, through restricted cubic spline and piecewise regression analysis, we determined that the height of 157-158 cm may be the critical point for short stature used to assess the risk of DM in Chinese women.              Conclusions:                    In the Chinese population, female short stature phenotype is related to increased DM risk, among which 157-158 cm may be the saturation effect point of female short stature for predicting DM risk.",-1
Methotrexate-induced Leukoencephalopathy: A Rare but Life-threatening Toxicity,"Methotrexate (MTX), an anti-metabolite, is part of various chemotherapy regimens to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and certain non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). It is the major drug used in central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Besides, its common hepatic, pulmonary, and hematologic toxicities, it has been implicated in the development of toxic leukoencephalopathy. Here, we present a case of a 19-year female, diagnosed with T-ALL. She was managed with UK ALL 2011 regimen B induction as a standard of care and intrathecal MTX as CNS prophylaxis. She tolerated induction well; however, during the second block of consolidation, she started developing lower limb weakness, inability to stand, unilateral weakness and aphasia. Her condition worsened rapidly over the next 24 hours leading to paraplegia and ultimately quadriplegia. Within 48 hours from onset of symptoms, she had lost all her motor functions, potentially leading to impending apnoea. We placed her on mechanical ventilation. MRI brain showed drug (MTX)-induced leukoencephalopathy (LE). In most cases, recovery starts within 5-7 days and by the 3rd week, majority have usually recovered. However, cases of irreversible neurologic damage and late-onset chronic toxicities have been reported. Key Words: Methotrexate, Leukoencephalopathy, Chemotherapy, Leukemias.",-1
Gut microbe-targeted choline trimethylamine lyase inhibition improves obesity via rewiring of host circadian rhythms,"Obesity has repeatedly been linked to reorganization of the gut microbiome, yet to this point obesity therapeutics have been targeted exclusively toward the human host. Here, we show that gut microbe-targeted inhibition of the trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway protects mice against the metabolic disturbances associated with diet-induced obesity (DIO) or leptin deficiency (Lepob/ob). Small molecule inhibition of the gut microbial enzyme choline TMA-lyase (CutC) does not reduce food intake but is instead associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, improvement in glucose tolerance, and enhanced energy expenditure. We also show that gut microbial CutC inhibition is associated with reorganization of host circadian control of both phosphatidylcholine and energy metabolism. This study underscores the relationship between microbe and host metabolism and provides evidence that gut microbe-derived trimethylamine (TMA) is a key regulator of the host circadian clock. This work also demonstrates that gut microbe-targeted enzyme inhibitors have potential as anti-obesity therapeutics.",-1
Therapeutic Role of Fat Injection in the Treatment of Recalcitrant Migraine Headaches,"Background:                    This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of site-specific fat injection for the treatment of refractory migraine headaches following medical or surgical treatment.              Methods:                    A prospective cohort study was performed on consecutive patients who had migraine headaches with persistent symptoms after surgical decompression and were given therapeutic fat injections from September of 2012 to January of 2015 with 12 months' minimum follow-up. Clinical outcomes assessment included migraine frequency, intensity, duration, migraine headache index, and complications. A 50 percent or greater decrease in frequency, intensity, or duration was considered therapeutic success, whereas 10 percent or greater increase in migraine headache index was considered worsening of symptoms. Pairwise t tests were used to assess statistical significance (p < 0.05).              Results:                    Twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. All were female, with a mean age of 49.0 years (range, 21.5 to 72.5 years), and mean follow-up was 29.4 months (range, 12.3 to 49.5 months). Twenty patients (69.0 percent) experienced successful improvement; 12 (41.4 percent) experienced complete resolution. Five patients (17.2 percent) experienced subtherapeutic improvement, and four (13.8 percent) experienced worsening of symptoms. Mean improvement per patient at their last follow-up was 5.1 (39.3 percent) fewer attacks per month (p = 0.035); 3.1 (42.0 percent) lower intensity on a scale of 1 to 10 (p = 0.001); 31.8 (74.4 percent) fewer hours of duration (p = 0.219); and 52.8 percent lower migraine headache index (p = 0.012). There were no complications for any patient.              Conclusions:                    Migraine headache symptoms were successfully reduced in the majority of cases with fat injection. A comprehensive surgical treatment algorithm including this novel procedure is presented.              Clinical question/level of evidence:                    Therapeutic, IV.",-1
Transcriptional Changes Involved in Atrophying Muscles during Prolonged Fasting in Rats,"Food deprivation resulting in muscle atrophy may be detrimental to health. To better understand how muscle mass is regulated during such a nutritional challenge, the current study deciphered muscle responses during phase 2 (P2, protein sparing) and phase 3 (P3, protein mobilization) of prolonged fasting in rats. This was done using transcriptomics analysis and a series of biochemistry measurements. The main findings highlight changes for plasma catabolic and anabolic stimuli, as well as for muscle transcriptome, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. Changes were generally consistent with the intense use of lipids as fuels during P2. They also reflected increased muscle protein degradation and repressed synthesis, in a more marked manner during P3 than P2 compared to the fed state. Nevertheless, several unexpected changes appeared to be in favor of muscle protein synthesis during fasting, notably at the level of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, transcription and translation processes, and the response to oxidative stress. Such mechanisms might promote protein sparing during P2 and prepare the restoration of the protein compartment during P3 in anticipation of food intake for optimizing the effects of an upcoming refeeding, thereby promoting body maintenance and survival. Future studies should examine relevance of such targets for improving nitrogen balance during catabolic diseases.",-1
Uterine Adenosarcoma in a Teen Ager,"Uterine adenosarcoma is a rare tumor composed of benign epithelium in combination with malignant mesenchymal components. Misdiagnosis is common due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations and the rarity of such tumors in young age groups. The mean age at diagnosis is 58.6 years, and <10% of patients are younger than 40 years. Herein, we describe a case of a 19-year girl who presented with worsening menorrhagia. Her ultrasound revealed multiple heterogeneous masses in the uterine cavity. Intraoperatively, a small piece of grayish-white tumor tissue was sent for the frozen section, but the results did not confirm malignancy. She underwent hysteroscopy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathologic examination finally confirmed uterine adenosarcoma. The patient had no evidence of residual tumor or recurrence during six months of follow-up. Key Words: Uterus, Adenosarcoma, Mixed tumor.",-1
Deciphering the blackbox of omics approaches and artificial intelligence in food waste transformation and mitigation,"It is necessary to stop the wastage of food during any stage of food chain to resolve the challenge of starvation, hunger and malnutrition in the world. Inception of modern techniques like omics (metagenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, wasteomics, diseaseomics etc), enzymatic treatments, and artificial intelligence in food waste reduction and management can bring a sustainable solution for food loss management, starvation and environmental challenges. Acceptance of modern techniques while policies formulation by government bodies can substantially strengthen the idea of waste reduction, food security and can easily save the life of around 25,000 children and adults dying of starvation every day. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can bestead current agriculture and food supply chain system to overcome the challenges of nutrition demand, resource depletion, climate change, population growth, and pollution. This communication provides a thorough examination of the concept of food waste management with omics approaches linkages. In addition, the notion of artificial intelligence in food waste transformation and mitigation, as well as present challenges and future prospects have been covered. Overall, this communication would assist decision-makers in identifying economically and environmentally appropriate biorefinery solutions ahead of time.",-1
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice of Adolescent Girls towards Reducing Malnutrition in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council, Borno State, Nigeria: Cross-Sectional Study","Addressing the gap in knowledge, attitude, and practice among adolescent girls are important as malnutrition has a negative effect on their future generation. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of adolescent girls towards reducing malnutrition in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council, Borno State, Nigeria. This was a school-based cross-sectional study conducted among 612 adolescent girls (10 to 19 years old). KoBo collect toolbox was used for the data collection between 3 June and 31 July 2019. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards reducing malnutrition. The majority of respondents (451, 80.2%; 322, 57.3%) had poor knowledge and attitude towards reducing malnutrition respectively, 278 (49.5%) had poor practice towards reducing malnutrition. Schooling (GGSS; p = 0.022; Shehu Garbai; p = 0.003) was a significant predictor of knowledge. Religion (p = 0.023), information (p < 0.001) and motivation (p < 0.001) were significant predictors of attitude. School (GGSS; p < 0.001; GGC; p < 0.001; Shehu garbai; p < 0.001; Bulabulin; p = 0.030; Zajeri day; p = 0.049), education of father (p = 0.001), information (p = 0.026) and behavioral skill (p = 0.019) were significant predictors of practice. There is a need to focus on both school-based and community-based health education intervention to address the poor knowledge, attitude, and practice among adolescent girls for a healthier future.",-1
Contribution of DECT in detecting serosal invasion of gastric cancer,"Background/aim:                    This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the iodine concentration (IC) of perigastric fat tissue as assessed by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and serosal invasion of gastric cancer.              Materials and methods:                    A total of 41 patients underwent preoperative staging evaluation for gastric cancer using DECT between July 2015 and March 2018. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on pathology results: serosal invasion (stage T4a) and intact serosa (stages T1âT3). Cutoff values, the diagnostic efficacy of IC in the perigastric fat tissue, and the perigastric fat tissue/tumor (P/T) ratio were determined.              Results:                    Among the 41 patients, 22 had stage T4a gastric cancer and 19 patients had gastric cancer with a stage lower than T4a. The mean IC of perigastric fat tissue and the P/T ratio were significantly higher in patients with serosal invasion than in those with intact serosa (P < 0.001). During the arterial phase, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.915 and 0.854 for the IC of perigastric fat tissue and the P/T ratio, respectively. During the venous phase, the AUC was 0.890 and 0.876 for the IC of perigastric fat tissue and the P/T ratio, respectively.              Conclusion:                    The IC in the perigastric fat tissue seems to be a reliable indicator for serosal invasion of gastric cancer.",-1
"Interplay between oxidative damage, the redox status, and metabolic biomarkers during long-term fasting","Obesity and its related metabolic disorders, as well as infectious diseases like covid-19, are important health risks nowadays. It was recently documented that long-term fasting improves metabolic health and enhanced the total antioxidant capacity. The present study investigated the influence of a 10-day fasting on markers of the redox status in 109 subjects. Reducing power, 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt radical cation(ABTS) radical scavenging capacity, and hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity increased significantly, and indicated an increase of circulating antioxidant levels. No differences were detected in superoxide scavenging capacity, protein carbonyls, and superoxide dismutase when measured at baseline and after 10 days of fasting. These findings were concomitant to a decrease in blood glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides as well as an increase in total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. In addition, the well-being index as well as the subjective energy levels increased, documenting a good tolerability. There was an interplay between redox and metabolic parameters since lipid peroxidation baseline levels (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]) affected the ability of long-term fasting to normalize lipid levels. A machine learning model showed that a combination of antioxidant parameters measured at baseline predicted the efficiency of the fasting regimen to decrease LDL levels. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that long-term fasting enhanced the endogenous production of antioxidant molecules, that act protectively against free radicals, and in parallel improved the metabolic health status. Our results suggest that the outcome of long-term fasting strategies could be depending on the baseline values of the antioxidative and metabolic status of subjects.",-1
A 3D in vitro model of the device-tissue interface: functional and structural symptoms of innate neuroinflammation are mitigated by antioxidant ceria nanoparticles,"Objective.The recording instability of neural implants due to neuroinflammation at the device-tissue interface is a primary roadblock to broad adoption of brain-machine interfaces. While a multiphasic immune response, marked by glial scaring, oxidative stress (OS), and neurodegeneration, is well-characterized, the independent contributions of systemic and local 'innate' immune responses are not well-understood. We aimed to understand and mitigate the isolated the innate neuroinflammatory response to devices.Approach.Three-dimensional primary neural cultures provide a unique environment for studying the drivers of neuroinflammation by decoupling the innate and systemic immune systems, while conserving an endogenous extracellular matrix and structural and functional network complexity. We created a three-dimensionalin vitromodel of the device-tissue interface by seeding primary cortical cells around microwires. Live imaging of both dye and Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) - mediated functional, structural, and lipid peroxidation fluorescence was employed to characterize the neuroinflammatory response.Main results.Live imaging of microtissues over time revealed independent innate neuroinflammation, marked by increased OS, decreased neuronal density, and increased functional connectivity. We demonstrated the use of this model for therapeutic screening by directly applying drugs to neural tissue, bypassing low bioavailability through thein vivoblood brain barrier. As there is growing interest in long-acting antioxidant therapies, we tested efficacy of 'perpetual' antioxidant ceria nanoparticles, which reduced OS, increased neuronal density, and protected functional connectivity.Significance.Our three-dimensionalin vitromodel of the device-tissue interface exhibited symptoms of OS-mediated innate neuroinflammation, indicating a significant local immune response to devices. The dysregulation of functional connectivity of microcircuits surround implants suggests the presence of an observer effect, in which the process of recording neural activity may fundamentally change the neural signal. Finally, the demonstration of antioxidant ceria nanoparticle treatment exhibited substantial promise as a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory treatment strategy.",-1
Artificial Intelligence for Screening of Multiple Retinal and Optic Nerve Diseases,"Importance:                    The lack of experienced ophthalmologists limits the early diagnosis of retinal diseases. Artificial intelligence can be an efficient real-time way for screening retinal diseases.              Objective:                    To develop and prospectively validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm that, based on ocular fundus images, recognizes numerous retinal diseases simultaneously in clinical practice.              Design, setting, and participants:                    This multicenter, diagnostic study at 65 public medical screening centers and hospitals in 19 Chinese provinces included individuals attending annual routine medical examinations and participants of population-based and community-based studies.              Exposures:                    Based on 120 002 ocular fundus photographs, the Retinal Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis System (RAIDS) was developed to identify 10 retinal diseases. RAIDS was validated in a prospective collected data set, and the performance between RAIDS and ophthalmologists was compared in the data sets of the population-based Beijing Eye Study and the community-based Kailuan Eye Study.              Main outcomes and measures:                    The performance of each classifier included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, and Cohen Îº score.              Results:                    In the prospective validation data set of 208 758 images collected from 110 784 individuals (median [range] age, 42 [8-87] years; 115 443 [55.3%] female), RAIDS achieved a sensitivity of 89.8% (95% CI, 89.5%-90.1%) to detect any of 10 retinal diseases. RAIDS differentiated 10 retinal diseases with accuracies ranging from 95.3% to 99.9%, without marked differences between medical screening centers and geographical regions in China. Compared with retinal specialists, RAIDS achieved a higher sensitivity for detection of any retinal abnormality (RAIDS, 91.7% [95% CI, 90.6%-92.8%]; certified ophthalmologists, 83.7% [95% CI, 82.1%-85.1%]; junior retinal specialists, 86.4% [95% CI, 84.9%-87.7%]; and senior retinal specialists, 88.5% [95% CI, 87.1%-89.8%]). RAIDS reached a superior or similar diagnostic sensitivity compared with senior retinal specialists in the detection of 7 of 10 retinal diseases (ie, referral diabetic retinopathy, referral possible glaucoma, macular hole, epiretinal macular membrane, hypertensive retinopathy, myelinated fibers, and retinitis pigmentosa). It achieved a performance comparable with the performance by certified ophthalmologists in 2 diseases (ie, age-related macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion). Compared with ophthalmologists, RAIDS needed 96% to 97% less time for the image assessment.              Conclusions and relevance:                    In this diagnostic study, the DL system was associated with accurately distinguishing 10 retinal diseases in real time. This technology may help overcome the lack of experienced ophthalmologists in underdeveloped areas.",-1
Machine learning-based heart disease diagnosis: A systematic literature review,"Heart disease is one of the significant challenges in today's world and one of the leading causes of many deaths worldwide. Recent advancement of machine learning (ML) application demonstrates that using electrocardiogram (ECG) and patients' data, detecting heart disease during the early stage is feasible. However, both ECG and patients' data are often imbalanced, which ultimately raises a challenge for the traditional ML to perform unbiasedly. Over the years, several data level and algorithm level solutions have been exposed by many researchers and practitioners. To provide a broader view of the existing literature, this study takes a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to uncover the challenges associated with imbalanced data in heart diseases predictions. Before that, we conducted a meta-analysis using 451 reference literature acquired from the reputed journals between 2012 and November 15, 2021. For in-depth analysis, 49 referenced literature has been considered and studied, taking into account the following factors: heart disease type, algorithms, applications, and solutions. Our SLR study revealed that the current approaches encounter various open problems/issues when dealing with imbalanced data, eventually hindering their practical applicability and functionality. In the diagnosis of heart disease, machine learning approaches help to improve data-driven decision-making.

The role of cardiovascular autonomic failure in the differential diagnosis of Î±-synucleinopathies,"The Î±-synucleinopathies comprise a group of adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB,) and - as a restricted non-motor form - pure autonomic failure (PAF). Neuropathologically, the Î±-synucleinopathies are characterized by aggregates of misfolded Î±-synuclein in the central and peripheral nervous system. Cardiovascular autonomic failure is a common non-motor symptom in people with PD, a key diagnostic criterion in MSA, a supportive feature for the diagnosis of DLB and disease-defining in PAF. The site of autonomic nervous system lesion differs between the Î±-synucleinopathies, with a predominantly central lesion pattern in MSA versus a peripheral one in PD, DLB, and PAF. In clinical practice, overlapping autonomic features often challenge the differential diagnosis among the Î±-synucleinopathies, but also distinguish them from related disorders, such as the tauopathies or other neurodegenerative ataxias. In this review, we discuss the differential diagnostic yield of cardiovascular autonomic failure in individuals presenting with isolated autonomic failure, parkinsonism, cognitive impairment, or cerebellar ataxia.",-1
Gender- and Age-Specific Associations between Visceral Obesity and Renal Function Impairment,"Objective:                    Although obesity is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, this trend becomes nonsignificant following adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. The present study aims to investigate whether visceral obesity is independently associated with renal function impairment.              Method:                    The medical records of 14,529 male and 10,561 female Chinese adults undergoing health check-ups during 2013-2015 were retrospectively collected. The baseline characteristics, including the degree of visceral fat and the percentage of body fat, were compared. The association between study groups and renal function impairment was investigated using regression models adjusted for confounding factors.              Results:                    All variables differed significantly among non-obese, peripheral, and central type obese subjects, both younger and older, and of both genders, except for hsCRP in older male subjects (p = 0.053) and eGFR in older female subjects (p = 0.098). Unadjusted univariate analysis showed that central obesity contributed significantly to renal function impairment in all age groups and in both genders. After adjusting for possible confounding factors, only central obesity was found to be an independent factor of renal function impairment in all groups, except for men under 45 years of age.              Conclusion:                    Visceral obesity is independently associated with renal function impairment in all ages and both genders, except for males younger than 45 years.",-1
Studies on the Mechanism of the Volatile Oils from Caoguo-4 Decoction in Regulating Spleen Deficiency Diarrhea by Adjusting Intestinal Microbiota,"Background:                    The Caoguo-4 decoction, a classical Mongolian medicine formula, is widely used to treat spleen deficiency diarrhea (SDD) in Mongolian for decades. Previously, the Caoguo-4 decoction volatile oil has been confirmed to be effective in ameliorating symptoms of spleen deficiency diarrhea in an animal model. However, the underlying mechanism of the Caoguo-4 decoction volatile oil is yet to be established. The aim of the current study was to investigate the antidiarrheal effects and mechanism of the Caoguo-4 decoction volatile oil.              Method:                    Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups of 10 animals including control, model, positive, Caoguo-4 decoction, and Caoguo-4 decoction volatile oil groups (10 rats in each group). All the rats, besides those in the control group, were induced to develop SDD by a bitter-cold purgation method with Xiaochengqi decoction. The antidiarrheal effect of Caoguo-4 decoction volatile oil was evaluated by pathological section, serum D-xylose and AMS content, plasma MTL content, and gut microbiota analysis via 16S rRNA sequencing.              Results:                    The results showed that the developed SDD rat model (model group) had decreased food intake, increased weight loss, soft stool, and bad hair color. When compared with the control group, serum was significantly reduced serum D-xylose and AML but increased MTL levels in the model group (p < 0.05). However, after treatment with either the Caoguo-4 decoction (the decoction group) or Smecta (the positive group) or volatile oil from the Caoguo-4 decoction (the volatile oil group), a significant increase in the serum D-xylose levels was observed. Additionally, AML levels significantly increased in the positive and volatile oil groups, and MTL levels significantly decreased in the decoction and volatile oil groups, when compared with the model group (p < 0.05). The pathological changes of the intestinal mucosa showed that the structure of the epithelium in the villi of the small intestine was affected, deformed, and incomplete in the model group when compared with the control group. However, either the decoction group or the volatile oil group recovered the villous morphology. The results of OTU analysis and alpha diversity analysis of intestinal bacteria showed that the intestinal microbiota of the SDD model rats showed an obvious decrease in richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota. But the intervention treatment of decoction and volatile oil could significantly recover the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota.              Conclusion:                    The intestinal microbiota destroyed in SDD modelling could be significantly improved by the Caoguo-4 decoction volatile oils, which provides reference for clinical medication.",-1
"Evaluation of a Novel User-Friendly Arthropod Repellent Gel, Verdegen","Hand sanitizers are developed as alcohol-based liquid gel formulations, generally used to decrease the amount of infectious agents on human hands. Verdegen, LLC proposed to prepare an arthropod repellent gel for public use when the recent outbreaks of Zika infection vectored through Aedes mosquitoes in the American continents prompted multi-faceted emergency measures. Four different gel formulations were developed, comprising two of the most efficacious commercial arthropod repellent active ingredients, N,N-diethyl-3-methyl benzamide (deet) and 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1-methylpropyl ester (picaridin), each at different concentrations (20 and 33% deet, or 20 and 33% picaridin). Compliance with the use of topical arthropod repellents remains an issue among military personnel. One of the most common complaints by Soldiers is that they do not like how the repellents applied on their skin leave behind an oily or greasy residue. These new gel formulations offer a user-friendly alternative for commonly used arthropod repellents formulations for the military and civilian personnel. We tested the efficacy and protection time of these new gel formulations in comparison with the commercially available cream formulations of deet and picaridin at similar concentrations. Our data show that gel formulations have better topical attributes, and offer equal or better biting protection for up to 48 h against host-seeking Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) female mosquitoes.",-1
"Single mosquito metatranscriptomics identifies vectors, emerging pathogens and reservoirs in one assay","Mosquitoes are major infectious disease-carrying vectors. Assessment of current and future risks associated with the mosquito population requires knowledge of the full repertoire of pathogens they carry, including novel viruses, as well as their blood meal sources. Unbiased metatranscriptomic sequencing of individual mosquitoes offers a straightforward, rapid, and quantitative means to acquire this information. Here, we profile 148 diverse wild-caught mosquitoes collected in California and detect sequences from eukaryotes, prokaryotes, 24 known and 46 novel viral species. Importantly, sequencing individuals greatly enhanced the value of the biological information obtained. It allowed us to (a) speciate host mosquito, (b) compute the prevalence of each microbe and recognize a high frequency of viral co-infections, (c) associate animal pathogens with specific blood meal sources, and (d) apply simple co-occurrence methods to recover previously undetected components of highly prevalent segmented viruses. In the context of emerging diseases, where knowledge about vectors, pathogens, and reservoirs is lacking, the approaches described here can provide actionable information for public health surveillance and intervention decisions.",-1
Psychological care in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in a real-world setting and associations with metabolic control,"Background:                    International guidelines recommend psychosocial care for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.              Objective:                    To assess psychological care in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in a real-world setting and to evaluate associations with metabolic outcome.              Methods:                    Delivery of psychological care, HbA1c, and rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes from 199 diabetes care centers participating in the German diabetes survey (DPV) were analyzed.              Results:                    Overall, 12 326 out of 31 861 children with type 1 diabetes were supported by short-term or continued psychological care (CPC). Children with psychological care had higher HbA1c (8.0% vs 7.7%, P<.001) and higher rates of DKA (0.032 vs 0.021 per patient-year, P<.001) compared with children without psychological care. In age-, sex-, diabetes duration-, and migratory background-matched children, HbA1c stayed stable in children supported by CPC during follow-up (HbA1c 8.5% one year before psychological care started vs 8.4% after two years, P = 1.0), whereas HbA1c was lower but increased significantly by 0.3% in children without psychological care (HbA1c 7.5% vs 7.8% after two years, P <.001). Additional HbA1c-matching showed that the change in HbA1c during follow-up was not different between the groups, but the percentage of children with severe hypoglycemia decreased from 16.3% to 10.7% in children receiving CPC compared with children without psychological care (5.5% to 5.8%, P =.009).              Conclusions:                    In this real-world setting, psychological care was provided to children with higher HbA1c levels. CPC was associated with stable glycemic control and less frequent severe hypoglycemia during follow-up.",-1
Targeting Mitochondria by Plant Secondary Metabolites: A Promising Strategy in Combating Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating neurodegenerative conditions, and is currently on the rise. Several dysregulated pathways are behind the pathogenesis of PD; however, the critical targets remain unclear. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to reveal the key dysregulated pathways in PD. Prevailing reports have highlighted the importance of mitochondrial and cross-talked mediators in neurological disorders, genetic changes, and related complications of PD. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms of PD, as well as the low efficacy and side effects of conventional neuroprotective therapies, drive the need for finding novel alternative agents. Recently, much attention has been paid to using plant secondary metabolites (e.g., flavonoids/phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and terpenoids) in the modulation of PD-associated manifestations by targeting mitochondria. In this line, plant secondary metabolites have shown promising potential for the simultaneous modulation of mitochondrial apoptosis and reactive oxygen species. This review aimed to address mitochondria and multiple dysregulated pathways in PD by plant-derived secondary metabolites.",-1
Virtual and Augmented Reality in Neurosurgery: The Evolution of its Application and Study Designs,"Background:                    As the art of neurosurgery evolves in the 21st century, more emphasis is placed on minimally invasive techniques, which require technical precision. Simultaneously, the reduction on training hours continues, and teachers of neurosurgery faces ""double jeopardy""-with harder skills to teach and less time to teach them. Mixed reality appears as the neurosurgical educators' natural ally: Virtual reality facilitates the learning of spatial relationships and permits rehearsal of skills, while augmented reality can make procedures safer and more efficient. Little wonder then, that the body of literature on mixed reality in neurosurgery has grown exponentially.              Methods:                    Publications involving virtual and augmented reality in neurosurgery were examined. A total of 414 papers were included, and they were categorized according to study design and analyzed.              Results:                    Half of the papers were published within the last 3 years alone. Whereas in the earlier half, most of the publications involved experiments in virtual reality simulation and the efficacy of skills acquisition, many of the more recent publication are proof-of-concept studies. This attests to the evolution of mixed reality in neurosurgery. As the technology advances, neurosurgeons are finding more applications, both in training and clinical practice.              Conclusions:                    With parallel advancement in Internet speed and artificial intelligence, the utilization of mixed reality will permeate neurosurgery. From solving staff problems in global neurosurgery, to mitigating the deleterious effect of duty-hour reductions, to improving individual operations, mixed reality will have a positive effect in many aspects of neurosurgery.",-1
J-shaped association between fasting blood glucose levels and COVID-19 severity in patients without diabetes,"Aims:                    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a recognized worldwide pandemic. Researchers now know that mortality from COVID-19 can be reduced through early prevention measures. This retrospective, multi-centered study of 293 COVID-19 patients without diabetes explores the association between fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels and the risk of COVID-19 disease progression, with the goal of providing clinical evidence for glycemic targets in patients.              Methods:                    The multivariate stepwise binary logistic regression analysis was used to test the dose-response effects of FBG levels on the risk of severe and critical condition in COVID-19 patients.              Results:                    FBG levels were plotted in quintiles with set at <4.74, 4.74-5.21, 5.21-5.78, 5.78-7.05, and â?.05 mmol/L. The constituent ratio of severe or critical cases in each FBG quintile was 20.7%, 1.7%, 13.8%, 27.1%, and 67.2%, respectively (P < 0.0001). When the second quintile was used as the reference, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) (95%CI) for the risk of severe/critical condition in COVID-19 was 25.33 (2.77, 231.64), 1.00 (Reference), 3.13 (0.33, 29.67), 10.59 (1.23, 91.24), 38.93 (4.36, 347.48) per FBG quintile respectively (P < 0.001).              Conclusions:                    We provide evidence of J-shaped associations between FBG and risk of severe and critical condition in non-diabetes patients with COVID-19, with nadir at 4.74-5.78 mmol/L.",-1
Fasting Plasma Glucose Variability and Gastric Cancer Risk in Individuals Without Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study,"Introduction:                    Long-term glycemic variability is associated with various adverse health outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the relationship between glycemic variability and gastric cancer remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between glycemic variability and gastric cancer incidence in individuals without DM.              Methods:                    We used the Korean National Health Insurance Service data sets of claims and health checkups and included 202,562 individuals without DM. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) variability was measured using the variability independent of the mean (VIM), coefficient of variation, SD, and average successive variability. The association between FPG variability and gastric cancer incidence was analyzed using Cox regression adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, income level, family history of cancer, mean FPG level, and number/mean interval of FPG measurements.              Results:                    In total, 1,920 patients developed gastric cancer (0.95%) within a median follow-up of 5.6 (5.3, 6.4) years. The fully adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for gastric cancer were 1.26 and 1.18-1.34, respectively, in the highest quartile of FPG variability assessed by VIM compared with that in the lowest quartile. Similar results were obtained in the normal and impaired fasting glucose groups and when using the variability indexes, including coefficient of variation, SD, and average successive variability. There was a sequential increase in the incidence of gastric cancer according to the increase in the deciles of FPG variability (P for linear trend <0.001). A 1-SD increase in FPG variability assessed by VIM was significantly associated with a 10.0% increase in gastric cancer risk in the fully adjusted model.              Discussion:                    In a DM-free population, high variability in visit-to-visit FPG levels was independently associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer.",-1
"Natural malaria infection in anophelines vectors and their incrimination in local malaria transmission in DariÃ©n, Panama","Background:                    More than 85% of the malaria cases in Panama occur in poor, rural and indigenous regions like Darien Province. Vector diversity, infection rate and spatial distribution are important entomological parameters of malaria transmission dynamics. Their understanding is crucial for the development of effective disease control strategies. The objective of this study was to determine the composition of Anopheles species, their natural infection rate and their geographic distribution to better understand the malaria transmission dynamics in DariÃ©n, Panama.              Methods:                    Anophelines mosquitoes were captured during the rainy and dry season of 2016. We selected five communities where adult anophelines were collected using CDC light-traps, and through protective human-baited traps. Detection of natural infection and Plasmodium genotype were detected via nested PCR through the amplification of ssrRNA and the circumsporozoite protein gene (csp), respectively.              Results:                    A total of 1,063 mosquitoes were collected mosquitoes were collected for the detection of natural infection with Plasmodium spp. Nine Anophelines species were identified, with the predominant species being: An. (Nys.) darlingi (45.0%) and An. (Nys.) albimanus (42.6%). Natural infection in An. (Nys.) albimanus with P. vivax was detected in one mosquito pool from the community Pueblo Tortuga (0.6%), three from Marraganti (1.7%), two from Bajo Chiquito (1.1%) and three pools from Alto Playona 3 (1.7%). For An. (Nys.) darlingi mosquitoes, we detected seven positive pools from the community Bajo Chiquito (4.0%), two pools from Marraganti (1.1%) and two pools from Alto Playona (1.1%). The P. vivax allelic variant VK210 was detected in infected mosquitoes.              Conclusion:                    The results from this study provide new information on the transmission dynamics associated with anophelines vectors in the DariÃ©n region. This is the first report of natural P. vivax infection in An. (Nys.) darlingi and its incrimination as a potential malaria vector in this region of Panama. Additional studies are necessary to expand our knowledge and determine crucial parameters in malaria transmission in DariÃ©n, which in turn will aid the National Malaria Program in attaining an adequate malaria control strategy towards malaria elimination.",-1
Mortality prediction of patients in intensive care units using machine learning algorithms based on electronic health records,"Improving predictive models for intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients requires a new strategy that periodically includes the latest clinical data and can be updated to reflect local characteristics. We extracted data from all adult patients admitted to the ICUs of two university hospitals with different characteristics from 2006 to 2020, and a total of 85,146 patients were included in this study. Machine learning algorithms were trained to predict in-hospital mortality. The predictive performance of conventional scoring models and machine learning algorithms was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The conventional scoring models had various predictive powers, with the SAPS III (AUROC 0.773 [0.766-0.779] for hospital S) and APACHE III (AUROC 0.803 [0.795-0.810] for hospital G) showing the highest AUROC among them. The best performing machine learning models achieved an AUROC of 0.977 (0.973-0.980) in hospital S and 0.955 (0.950-0.961) in hospital G. The use of ML models in conjunction with conventional scoring systems can provide more useful information for predicting the prognosis of critically ill patients. In this study, we suggest that the predictive model can be made more robust by training with the individual data of each hospital.",-1
Glucose-mediated proliferation of a gut commensal bacterium promotes Plasmodium infection by increasing mosquito midgut pH,"Plant-nectar-derived sugar is the major energy source for mosquitoes, but its influence on vector competence for malaria parasites remains unclear. Here, we show that Plasmodium berghei infection of Anopheles stephensi results in global metabolome changes, with the most significant impact on glucose metabolism. Feeding on glucose or trehalose (the main hemolymph sugars) renders the mosquito more susceptible to Plasmodium infection by alkalizing the mosquito midgut. The glucose/trehalose diets promote proliferation of a commensal bacterium, Asaia bogorensis, that remodels glucose metabolism in a way that increases midgut pH, thereby promoting Plasmodium gametogenesis. We also demonstrate that the sugar composition from different natural plant nectars influences A. bogorensis growth, resulting in a greater permissiveness to Plasmodium. Altogether, our results demonstrate that dietary glucose is an important determinant of mosquito vector competency for Plasmodium, further highlighting a key role for mosquito-microbiota interactions in regulating the development of the malaria parasite.",-1
CTCF-activated SNHG16 facilitates gastrointestinal stromal tumor by targeting miR-128-3p/CASC3 axis,"In this study, it was ascertained that SNHG16 was up-regulated in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) tissues and cells, and was responsible for the aggravated malignant behaviors of GIST cells. CTCF served as a transcription activator responsible for the overexpression of SNHG16 in GIST cells. MiR-128-3p was negatively regulated by SNHG16 and exerted anti-tumor effects. Moreover, CASC3 was the direct target mRNA of miR-128-3p, through which miR-128-3p exerted function influence on GIST cell malignant behaviors. SNHG16 competitively bound with miR-128-3p against CASC3, thus positively regulating CASC3 expression. Finally, functional assays carried out in vitro proved SNHG16 could modulate GIST cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis via miR-128-3p/CASC3 axis. Animal experiments were also designed and implemented in a rescue way and evidenced that up-regulation of CASC3 countervailed the inhibitory impacts of SNHG16 silence on the progression of GIST. In summary, SNHG16 up-regulated by CTCF facilitated the progression of GIST through miR-128-3p/CASC3.",-1
Minor lipids profiling in subcutaneous and epicardial fat tissue using LC/MS with an optimized preanalytical phase,"Analysis of bioactive lipids in adipose tissue could lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity and its complications. However, current MS methods are limited by a high content of triacylglycerols (TAGs), which markedly surpasses the amount of other lipids and suppresses their ionization. The aim of our study was thus to optimize the preanalytical phase of lipid analysis in adipose tissue, focusing in particular on less-abundant lipids. Next, the optimized method was used to describe the differences between epicardial and subcutaneous adipose tissues obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Lipids were extracted using a modified Folch method with subsequent detachment of TAGs by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The extracts with/without TAGs were analyzed by tandem LC/MS. The repeatability of the presented method expressed by the median of the coefficients of variation was 12/5% for analysis with/without TAGs separation, respectively. The difference in the relative abundance of TAGs gained with/without TLC was, on average, 19% and did not reach significance (p value > 0.05) for any identified TAG. The novel preanalytical step allowed us to detect 37 lipids, which could not have been detected without TAG separation, because their signal to noise ratio is <5 in current methods of untargeted lipidomics. These lipids belong predominately to ceramides, glycerophosphatidylserines, glycerophosphatidylinsitols, sphingomyelins, glycerophosphatidylcholines, glycerophosphatidylethanolamines, diacylglycerols. The two adipose tissue depots differed mainly in the following lipid classes: glycerophosphatidylcholines, glycerophosphatidylinositols, glycerophosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelins. Moreover, other major lipids showed distinctly different distributions between the two adipose tissues. Among these, the changes in TAGs were the most striking, which correspond to previously published data describing the differences between omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Implementation of the TLC step for the elimination of TAGs was crucial for enhancing the MS detection limit of minor lipids in adipose tissue. The differences between the overall lipid profiles of subcutaneous and epicardial tissue reflect their different functions arising from their location.",-1
Ugandan stakeholder hopes and concerns about gene drive mosquitoes for malaria control: new directions for gene drive risk governance,"Background:                    The African Union's High-Level Panel on Emerging Technologies identified gene drive mosquitoes as a priority technology for malaria elimination. The first field trials are expected in 5-10 years in Uganda, Mali or Burkina Faso. In preparation, regional and international actors are developing risk governance guidelines which will delineate the framework for identifying and evaluating risks. Scientists and bioethicists have called for African stakeholder involvement in these developments, arguing the knowledge and perspectives of those people living in malaria-afflicted countries is currently missing. However, few African stakeholders have been involved to date, leaving a knowledge gap about the local social-cultural as well as ecological context in which gene drive mosquitoes will be tested and deployed. This study investigates and analyses Ugandan stakeholders' hopes and concerns about gene drive mosquitoes for malaria control and explores the new directions needed for risk governance.              Methods:                    This qualitative study draws on 19 in-depth semi-structured interviews with Ugandan stakeholders in 2019. It explores their hopes for the technology and the risks they believed pertinent. Coding began at a workshop and continued through thematic analysis.              Results:                    Participants' hopes and concerns for gene drive mosquitoes to address malaria fell into three themes: (1) ability of gene drive mosquitoes to prevent malaria infection; (2) impacts of gene drive testing and deployment; and, (3) governance. Stakeholder hopes fell almost exclusively into the first theme while concerns were spread across all three. The study demonstrates that local stakeholders are able and willing to contribute relevant and important knowledge to the development of risk frameworks.              Conclusions:                    International processes can provide high-level guidelines, but risk decision-making must be grounded in the local context if it is to be robust, meaningful and legitimate. Decisions about whether or not to release gene drive mosquitoes as part of a malaria control programme will need to consider the assessment of both the risks and the benefits of gene drive mosquitoes within a particular social, political, ecological, and technological context. Just as with risks, benefits-and importantly, the conditions that are necessary to realize them-must be identified and debated in Uganda and its neighbouring countries.",-1
Gut microbiota dysbiosis in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis,"Introduction and aim:                    Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a global epidemic disease that results from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and may progress to liver cirrhosis. The relationship between hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV-RC) and gut microbiota dysbiosis is still unclear. The aim of this study is to elucidate the compositional and functional characteristics of the gut microbiota in the patients with liver cirrhosis and healthy individuals.              Materials and methods:                    We analyzed the gut microbiome in patients with HBV-RC and healthy individuals by 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples. A total of 113 genera, 85 families, 57 orders, 44 classes and 21 phyla were performed.              Results:                    Our results suggests that the composition of the gut microbiota had changed in the early stages of cirrhosis. We further identified more than 17 genera with different richness in compensated and decompensated cirrhosis groups. PICRUSt analysis showed that changes in bacterial composition can lead to significant changes in gene function, which may be one of the causes of liver cirrhosis.              Conclusion:                    Our study demonstrated that the composition of gut microbiota changed at different phases of HBV-RC. Gut microbiome transformation may be a biological factor in the progression of cirrhosis.",-1
The Association Between Six Surrogate Insulin Resistance Indexes and Hypertension: A Population-Based Study,"Background: The relationship between insulin resistance and hypertension is well established, but the association of different surrogate insulin resistance indexes with the presence of hypertension is still under debate. The aim of this study was to compare the strength of the association between the presence of hypertension and six indexes: triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C), Triglyceride Glucose (TyG) Index, Visceral adiposity index (VAI), Lipid accumulation product (LAP), TyG-Body mass index (TyG-BMI), and TyG-Waist circumference (TyG-WC). Methods: Data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study enrolling a sample representative for the Romanian population aged 18-80 years, excluding those with diabetes or requiring treatment for hypertriglyceridemia, were used to calculate the six indexes. The association with the presence of hypertension was examined with binomial and multinomial logistic regression. Results: In multinomial logistic models, which included age, gender, smoking, drinking, sedentary lifestyle, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary sodium, urinary albumin creatinine ratio, and use of medications known to influence insulin resistance as covariates, all individual components and surrogate insulin resistance indexes were independently associated with the presence of hypertension. Values of pseudo R square ranged from 0.342 for the multivariate model including TG/HDL-C to 0.357 for the model including TyG-WC, but with no clear superiority of any of the tested indexes over all others. Models including BMI and WC had a similar ability to predict the presence of hypertension as most of the surrogate indexes and they were slightly superior to TG/HDL-C and TyG. Conclusions: Although TG/HDL-C, VAI, LAP, TyG, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WC were independently associated with the presence of hypertension, no superiority could be demonstrated over the use of BMI and WC as predictors of hypertension in this cross-sectional study.",-1
Clinical utility of ultrasonography-measured visceral adipose tissue depth as a tool in early pregnancy screening for gestational diabetes: a proof-of-concept study,"Aim:                    To examine, in a proof-of-concept study, the ability of visceral adipose tissue depth and subcutaneous fat depth measured in early pregnancy to predict subsequent gestational diabetes, and to assess the performance of these measures as screening tests for gestational diabetes compared with use of the current UK criteria.              Methods:                    A total of 100 women in early pregnancy were recruited from a maternity hospital in Belfast, UK. Visceral adipose tissue depth and subcutaneous fat depth were measured, and each participant underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks' gestation for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes using WHO 2013 criteria.              Results:                    Eighty women completed the study, of whom 15 (19%) developed gestational diabetes. Increasing visceral adipose tissue depth, but not subcutaneous fat depth, was associated with greater gestational diabetes risk after adjusting for confounding factors (odds ratio for a 1-sd rise 2.09, 95% CI 1.06-4.12; P=0.03). Visceral adipose tissue depth â?.27 cm had greater sensitivity compared with current National Institute of Health and Care Excellence criteria (87% vs 40%, respectively; P=0.02) and similar specificity (62% vs 74%, respectively; P=0.15) for identifying gestational diabetes.              Conclusions:                    Ultrasonography-measured visceral adipose tissue in early pregnancy is a potential clinical tool for improving sensitivity of selective screening for gestational diabetes, which, compared with universal oral glucose tolerance testing, is likely to reduce by half the numbers requiring this test. Further larger studies are now required for confirmation, including investigation into impact on clinical outcomes.",-1

Assessment of Psychosocial Functioning in a Large Cohort of Patients with Schizophrenia,"Background:                    This study addresses the question of whether psychosocial functioning measured by the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale is related to various psychopathological measures in a cohort of patients with schizophrenia.              Methods:                    The 'Neuroleptic Strategy Study' (NeSSy) performed at 14 German hospitals between 2010 and 2013 compared two treatment strategies instead of individual drugs. Secondary end-points were the two PSP scales as well as measures of quality of life (SF-36) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).              Results:                    149 patients were randomised. There was no difference between the two treatment strategies (first-generation versus second-generation antipsychotics) with regard to the PSP. There were differences in doctors' assessments regarding psychosocial functioning compared with patients' own assessments. Furthermore, there were relationships between the PSP and quality of life, level of skills (ICF), and severity of disease (PANSS), level of sexual activities and poor well-being under antipsychotic medication but not with cognitive changes.              Conclusions:                    The findings on psychosocial functioning of patients with schizophrenia related to severity and skill level could be confirmed. Further findings were the correlation between psychosocial functioning and quality of life, well-being under treatment, and sexuality what emphasizes the substantial importance of a reduced psychosocial functioning.",-1
"Impacts of ivermectin mass drug administration for onchocerciasis on mosquito populations of Ogun state, Nigeria","Background:                    The impact of single-dose mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin for onchocerciasis on mosquito populations was investigated in Ogun State, Nigeria.              Methods:                    Indoor and outdoor collection of mosquitoes was carried out in two intervention (IC) and two control communities (CC) at three different periods: pre-MDA (baseline), 2-3 days after MDA and 13-14 days after MDA. The density and parity rate of female Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes were determined and compared. Environmental and climatic data of study locations were obtained to perform generalized linear model analysis.              Results:                    A total of 1399 female mosquitoes were collected, including 1227 Anopheles and 172 Culex mosquitoes. There was a similar magnitude of reduction in the indoor density of Anopheles by 29% in the IC and CC 2-3 days post-MDA but the reduction in indoor parity rate was significantly higher (p = 0.021) in the IC, reducing by more than 50%. In the IC, observation of a significant reduction at 2-3 days post-MDA was consistent for both the indoor density (1.43 to 1.02) and indoor parity rate (95.35% to 44.26%) of Anopheles mosquitoes. The indoor parity rate of Anopheles remained significantly reduced (75.86%) 13-14 post-MDA. On the other hand, the indoor density of Culex increased from 0.07 to 0.10 at 2-3 days post-MDA while the indoor parity rate of Culex did not change. The outdoor density of Anopheles in the IC increased (p = 0.394) from 0.58 to 0.90 at 2-3 days post-MDA; a similar observation was consistent for the outdoor density (2.83 to 3.90) and outdoor parity rate (70.59% to 97.44%) of Culex, while the outdoor parity rate of Anopheles reduced from 85.71 to 66.67% at 2-3 days post-MDA. A generalized linear model showed that ivermectin MDA significantly caused a reduction in both the indoor density (p < 0.001) and indoor parity rate (p = 0.003) of Anopheles in the IC.              Conclusion:                    Ivermectin MDA resulted in the reduction of both the survival and density of Anopheles mosquitoes. This has strong implications for malaria transmission, which depends strongly on vector survival.",-1
Multi-kingdom microbiota analyses identify bacterial-fungal interactions and biomarkers of colorectal cancer across cohorts,"Despite recent progress in our understanding of the association between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), multi-kingdom gut microbiome dysbiosis in CRC across cohorts is unexplored. We investigated four-kingdom microbiota alterations using CRC metagenomic datasets of 1,368 samples from 8 distinct geographical cohorts. Integrated analysis identified 20 archaeal, 27 bacterial, 20 fungal and 21 viral species for each single-kingdom diagnostic model. However, our data revealed superior diagnostic accuracy for models constructed with multi-kingdom markers, in particular the addition of fungal species. Specifically, 16 multi-kingdom markers including 11 bacterial, 4 fungal and 1 archaeal feature, achieved good performance in diagnosing patients with CRC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.83) and maintained accuracy across 3 independent cohorts. Coabundance analysis of the ecological network revealed associations between bacterial and fungal species, such as Talaromyces islandicus and Clostridium saccharobutylicum. Using metagenome shotgun sequencing data, the predictive power of the microbial functional potential was explored and elevated D-amino acid metabolism and butanoate metabolism were observed in CRC. Interestingly, the diagnostic model based on functional EggNOG genes achieved high accuracy (AUROC = 0.86). Collectively, our findings uncovered CRC-associated microbiota common across cohorts and demonstrate the applicability of multi-kingdom and functional markers as CRC diagnostic tools and, potentially, as therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRC.",-1
Faeces from malnourished colorectal cancer patients accelerate cancer progression,"Backgroud:                    Malnutrition has been confirmed to play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression via the gut microenvironment. However, the characteristics of the gut microbiota or its potential biological mechanism in CRC remain inconclusive.              Methods:                    In this work, Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool and 16sRNA sequencing were prepared to detect the variation in gut microbiota and the association between nutrition status and gut microbiota. RDA/CCA analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between faecal microbiota from malnourished CRC and clinical nutrition indicators. To investigate the mechanism of the gut microbiota in CRC, faecal samples from malnourished CRC patients were transplanted into C57BL/6J and DSS/AOM mouse models. Moreover, FACS and IHC were prepared to detect the infiltration of B cells and macrophages. qPCR and Elisa assays were performed to explore the expression of cytokines.              Result:                    We found dramatic variation in the faecal microbiota among patients with different nutritional statuses, discovering that specific microbiota species, namely, Atopobium vaginae, Selenomonas sputigena and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, may be considered diagnostic biomarkers in malnutrition and indicate poor prognosis. High expression level of A. vaginae in CRC tissues revealed the poorer overall survival compared with low expression level (Mean survival: 23.0 months vs 29.0 months). Faecal from malnourished colorectal cancer were found to be protumorigenic. More importantly, our evidence suggests that after faecal microbiota transplantation, B cells and macrophages are recruited to activate specific tumour immunity in CRC. Depletion of B cells significantly suppressed faecal microbiota-induced M2b polarization as well as the protumorigenic activity of tumour-associated macrophages in vivo.              Conclusion:                    Faecal microbiota in CRC under malnutrition conditions exhibits specific characteristics that accelerate CRC progression and regulate B cells and macrophages. The use of specific faecal microbial species could be a feasible approach for identifying the malnutrition status of patients and demonstrating the poor prognosis of CRC.",-1
Automated and accurate quantification of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from magnetic resonance imaging based on machine learning,"Accurate measuring of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is vital for the research of many diseases. The localization and quantification of SAT and VAT by computed tomography (CT) expose patients to harmful ionizing radiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe and painless test. The aim of this paper is to explore a practical method for the segmentation of SAT and VAT based on the iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least square estimationâiron quantification (IDEAL-IQ) technology and machine learning. The approach involves two main steps. First, a deep network is designed to segment the inner and outer boundaries of SAT in fat images and the peritoneal cavity contour in water images. Second, after mapping the peritoneal cavity contour onto the fat images, the assumption-free K-means++ with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (AFK-MC2) clustering method is used to obtain the VAT content. An MRI data set from 75 subjects is utilized to construct and evaluate the new strategy. The Dice coefficients for the SAT and VAT content obtained from the proposed method and the manual measurements performed by experts are 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method and the manual measurements exhibit high reliability.",-1
Gene-Environment Interaction on Type 2 Diabetes Risk among Chinese Adults Born in Early 1960s,"Background:                    Gene-environment interactions on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk are studied little among Chinese adults.              Aim:                    This study aimed to explore the interactions among Chinese adults born in early 1960s.              Methods:                    The interaction of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental factors on T2D risk were analyzed by multiple linear or logistic regression models, and in total 2216 subjects were included with the age of 49.7 Â± 1.5 years.              Results:                    High dietary intake increased the effects of rs340874 on impaired fasting glucose (IFG), rs5015480, rs7612463 on T2D (OR = 2.27, 2.37, 11.37, respectively), and reduced the effects of rs7172432 on IFG, rs459193 on impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (OR = 0.08, 0.28, respectively). The associations between rs4607517 and T2D, rs10906115 and IGT, rs4607103, rs5015480 and IFG could be modified by drinking/smoking (OR = 2.28, 0.20, 3.27, 2.58, respectively). Physical activity (PA) interacted with rs12970134, rs2191349, rs4607517 on T2D (OR = 0.39, 3.50, 2.35, respectively), rs2796441 and rs4607517 on IGT (OR = 0.42, 0.33, respectively), and rs4430796, rs5215, and rs972283 on IFG (OR = 0.39, 3.05, 7.96, respectively). Significant interactions were identified between socioeconomic status and rs10830963, rs13266634 on T2D (OR = 0.41, 0.44, respectively), rs1470579 and rs2796441 on IGT (OR = 2.13, 2.37, respectively), and rs7202877 and rs7612463 on IFG (OR = 5.64, 9.18, respectively).              Conclusion:                    There indeed existed interactions between environmental factors and genetic variants on T2D risk among Chinese adults.",-1
The Effectiveness of a Time Management Workshop on Job Stress of Nurses Working in Emergency Departments: An Experimental Study,"Introduction:                    One of the main risk factors for poor health is a high level of job stress. Time management skills can greatly reduce job stress. The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a one-time management training workshop on job stress among nurses working in emergency departments.              Methods:                    This randomized experimental study was carried out with 80 nurses working in emergency departments affiliated with a university of medical sciences. The intervention was an 8-hour workshop on time management. Pre- and posttest data were collected by demographic questionnaire and an occupational stress inventory before and 1 month after intervention. Data were analyzed using descriptive, chi-square, t test, Fisher exact, and analysis of covariance statistics.              Results:                    The mean of job stress in the intervention group increased after the intervention (186.22, SD = 22.97) from baseline (182.52, SD = 34.39) compared with the mean of job stress in the control group (204.42, SD = 22.42) and (204.35, SD = 22.45). The control group had a significantly higher job stress score before the intervention (t = -3.37, P = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control group in job stress scores after intervention (t = -3.56, P = 0.77).              Discussion:                    The time management skills training program did not reduce the moderate-high levels of job stress of nurses in emergency departments. Addressing other sources of job stress, besides time management, is needed.",-1
Trends and Characteristics of Hospitalizations in Patients With Heart Transplant,"There is limited data regarding the leading causes of hospitalization among heart transplant (HT) recipients and the characteristics of these hospitalizations. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample weighted data between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2018, which included hospitalized adults â?8 years with a history of HT. Primary outcomes were the 10 most common primary causes of hospitalizations, clinical characteristics, inpatient mortality, length of stay, and inflation-adjusted care costs. We divided the study population in two period (2004-2014 and 2016-2018) to report the most common causes of hospitalizations. We identified a total of 209,771 weighted hospitalizations with a history of HT between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2018. Between 2004 and 2014, pneumonia (6.21%), acute or unspecified renal failure (4.94%), complication of device, implant or graft (4.66%), sepsis (4.56%), and congestive heart failure (2.94%) were the most common causes of hospitalizations for HT recipient. Between 2016 and 2018, sepsis (9.03%), acute or unspecific renal failure (6.27%), complication of device, implant or graft (5.16%), pneumonia (4.92%), and complications of surgical procedure or medical device (3.86%) were the most common causes of hospitalizations for HT recipient. Sepsis had the highest inpatient mortality accounting for 11.32% of inpatient mortality in the 2004-2014 period and 6% in the 2016-2018 period. In summary, infections, acute renal failure, and other transplant complications are the leading causes of hospitalization among HT recipients. Sepsis carries the highest inpatient mortality.",-1
Effects of Green and Ripe Coffee in the Metabolic Profile and Muscle Enzymes in Animals Practicing Physical Exercise,"Many studies have shown that plants can be therapeutic alternatives in the prevention or treatment of various diseases. Among these, green coffee may present different pharmacological effects related to the regulation of glycemia and lipid metabolism and is related to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of using green and ripe coffee on the metabolic profile and muscular enzymes after the practice of physical exercises in Wistar rats. We included six groups: G1 (control group), G2 (group submitted to swimming), G3 (group that consumed green coffee), G4 (group that consumed green coffee and was submitted to swimming), G5 (group that consumed ripe coffee), and G6 (group that consumed ripe coffee and was submitted to swimming). Our results showed that there was a significant reduction in the percentage of visceral fat in G3, G5, and G6. We did not observe significant modifications in glycemia, lipids, lactate dehydrogenase, ferric reducing ability of plasma, and ferric-xylenol orange. The levels of creatine phosphokinase showed a reduction in the groups G2 and G4. No significant differences were found in the atherogenic indices. There is a global demand for natural compounds that can be safe, cheap, related to minimum side effects, and provide health benefits. Our results show that the use of green or ripe coffee may contribute to reduce the percentage of visceral fat and consequently may protect against further complications once this tissue produces proatherogenic hormones. Furthermore, green coffee may play a role in protecting muscle injury after the practice of physical exercises.",-1
Quantification of salt stress in wheat leaves by Raman spectroscopy and machine learning,"The salinity level of the growing medium has diverse effects on the development of plants, including both physical and biochemical changes. To determine the salt stress level of a plant endures, one can measure these structural and chemical changes. Raman spectroscopy and biochemical analysis are some of the most common techniques in the literature. Here, we present a combination of machine learning and Raman spectroscopy with which we can both find out the biochemical change that occurs while the medium salt concentration changes and predict the level of salt stress a wheat sample experiences accurately using our trained regression models. In addition, by applying different machine learning algorithms, we compare the level of success for different algorithms and determine the best method to use in this application. Production units can take actions based on the quantitative information they get from the trained machine learning models related to salt stress, which can potentially increase efficiency and avoid the loss of crops.",-1
"Efficiency of the CO 2 -baited omni-directional Fay-Prince trap under semi-field conditions and characterizing response behaviours for the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti","Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a vector of several serious disease-causing viruses including Dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. Effective and efficient trapping methods are essential for meaningful mosquito population and disease-presence surveillance and ultimately, vector control. The Fay-Prince trap (FPT) was developed in the late 1960s as a daytime visual trap for male Ae. aegypti. Since then, its use has been expanded into the trapping of female Ae. aegypti, Aedes albopictus Skuse, other Ae. spp., and Culex spp. The efficiency of the FPT alone and with CO2 was tested under semi-field conditions and the behaviour of responding female Ae. aegypti was characterized. The mean capture efficiency of the FPT with CO2 per 30 min in the greenhouse was 3.07% and the capture rate from the total number of mosquitoes in our semi-field setup was slightly higher at 4.45%. Understanding the behaviours that mosquitoes exhibit during their encounter with particularly a visual trap may recommend trap improvements and contributes to our understanding of host-seeking behaviour and how it might be exploited.",-1
Astrocytic Changes in Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation Protein Levels in Parkinson's Disease,"Background:                    Mitochondrial dysfunction within neurons, particularly those of the substantia nigra, has been well characterized in Parkinson's disease and is considered to be related to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Dysfunction within this important organelle has been suggested to impair neuronal communication and survival; however, the reliance of astrocytes on mitochondria and the impact of their dysfunction on this essential cell type are less well characterized.              Objective:                    This study aimed to uncover whether astrocytes harbor oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiencies in Parkinson's disease and whether these deficiencies are more likely to occur in astrocytes closely associated with neurons or those more distant from them.              Methods:                    Postmortem human brain sections from patients with Parkinson's disease were subjected to imaging mass cytometry for individual astrocyte analysis of key OXPHOS proteins across all five complexes.              Results:                    We show the variability in the astrocytic expression of mitochondrial proteins between individuals. In addition, we found that there is evidence of deficiencies in respiratory chain subunit expression within these important glia and changes, particularly in mitochondrial mass, associated with Parkinson's disease and that are not simply a consequence of advancing age.              Conclusion:                    Our data show that astrocytes, like neurons, are susceptible to mitochondrial defects and that these could have an impact on their reactivity and ability to support neurons in Parkinson's disease.",-1
Curcumin Alleviates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colitis in Mice Through Regulating Gut Microbiota,"Scope:                    Curcumin is a natural polyphenol compound with multiple pharmacologic activities. The present study aims to explore the potential therapeutic properties of curcumin on intestinal inflammatory diseases, including its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties, as well as their associations with altered intestinal microbiome.              Methods and results:                    DSS, i.e., Dextran Sulfate Sodium, (3%) is administered to C57BL/6J mice in the drinking water daily for 6 days in DSS and curcumin groups. Then, mice in curcumin groups are orally administered with 50 or 150 mg kg-1 curcumin for 7 days. On day 13, mice are sacrificed. Results show that oral administration with curcumin relieves macroscopic pathological manifestations, e.g., colon length and histological change. Moreover, it enhances intestinal barrier via increasing expression of tight junction proteins, e.g., occludin, ZO-1, claudin-3; alleviates DSS-induced intestinal apoptosis via suppressing caspase-3 pathway; mitigates intestinal inflammation via inhibiting the MAPK/NFÎºB/STAT3 pathway. It is also noticed that curcumin is beneficial for modulating abundance of some specific bacteria, including Akkermansia, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Turicibacter, as well as families such as F16, Enterococcaceae, and Aerococcaceae. Most of the altered bacteria by curcumin are highly correlated with colitis-associated parameters.              Conclusion:                    Curcumin shows therapeutic potential against colitis. It may be served as an alternative medicine or adjuvant therapy in the treatment of colitis.",-1
CircFOXK2 enhances tumorigenesis and immune evasion in non-small cell lung cancer by miR-485-5p/PD-L1 axis,"Background:                    Circular RNAs (circRNAs) serve a key role in lots of cancers. The outcomes of upregulated circular RNA forkhead box K2 (circFOXK2) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) persisted uncertainly. In this study, the role of circFOXK2 in NSCLC was inspected.              Methods:                    The abundances of circFOXK2, microRNA-485-5p (miR-485-5p) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and clonogenic assay were accomplished to conclude the proliferation of NSCLC cells. Wound healing and transwell assays were implemented to evaluate cell migration and invasion. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay was enforced to quantify the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. Flow cytometry assay was employed to detect apoptosis. Besides, the mice experiments were utilized for in vivo tumorigenesis analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was carried out to reveal the associations between miR-485-5p and circFOXK2 or PD-L1.              Results:                    CircFOXK2 and PD-L1 levels were augmented in NSCLC. CircFOXK2 targeted miR-485-5p, which could bind to PD-L1. CircFOXK2 served a key role in NSCLC tumorigenesis and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells. MiR-485-5p inhibition or PD-L1 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effects of circFOXK2 lack on NSCLC tumorigenesis and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells.              Conclusion:                    CircFOXK2 sponged miR-485-5p to stimulate PD-L1 and expedited NSCLC development.",-1
The effect of hydration status on plasma FGF21 concentrations in humans: A subanalysis of a randomised crossover trial,"Aim:                    Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has recently been implicated in thirst in rodent models. The mechanisms for this are currently uncertain, and it is unclear whether hydration status can alter FGF21 concentrations, potentially providing an additional mechanism by which hypohydration induces thirst. The aim of this study is therefore to understand whether hydration status can alter circulating FGF21 in humans.              Methods:                    Using a heat tent and fluid restriction, we induced hypohydration (1.9% body mass loss) in 16 healthy participants (n = 8 men), and compared their glycaemic regulation to a rehydration protocol (heat tent and fluid replacement) in a randomised crossover design.              Results:                    After the hypohydration procedure, urine specific gravity, urine and serum osmolality, and plasma copeptin (as a marker for arginine vasopressin) increased as expected, with no change after the rehydration protocol. In the fasted state, the median paired difference in plasma FGF21 concentrations from the rehydrated to hypohydrated trial arm was -37 (interquartile range -125, 10) pgâmL-1(P = 0.278), with average concentrations being 458 Â± 462 pgâmL-1 after hypohydration and 467 Â± 438 pgâmL-1 after rehydration; mean difference -9 Â± 173 pgâmL-1.              Conclusion:                    To our knowledge, these are the first causal data in humans investigating hydration and FGF21, demonstrating that an acute bout of hypohydration does not impact fasted plasma FGF21 concentrations. These data may suggest that whilst previous research has found FGF21 administration can induce thirst and drinking behaviours, a physiological state implicated in increased thirst (hypohydration) does not appear to impact plasma FGF21 concentrations in humans.",-1
Infants' use of motion cues in object individuation processes,"We investigated 10-month-old infants' and adults' numerical expectations in scenarios where information on self-motion and static object features may give rise to numerically incongruent representations. A red circle or a blue box with yellow stripes appeared on the left side of a screen, moved autonomously sideways and then moved back behind the screen. Next, on the opposite side, an identical object was first brought in view by a hand and then pushed back behind the screen (Experiments 1 and 2). The screen was finally removed, revealing either one or two objects. Infants looked longer at one-object test events, suggesting that they expected to find two objects. Adults were also shown these animations and were asked for their numerical expectations. Contrary to infants, they expected one single object (Experiment 3). Whereas preverbal infants' numerical expectations appeared to be dominated by information on object autonomous and induced motion, adults' expectations were mainly guided by information about object shape, size, and color. These findings were discussed in relation to current models on the development of object individuation processes.",-1
Molecular adaptations in human subcutaneous adipose tissue after ten weeks of endurance exercise training in healthy males,"Endurance exercise training induces adaptations in metabolically active organs, but adaptations in human subcutaneous adipose tissue (scAT) remains incompletely understood. On the basis of animal studies, we hypothesized that endurance exercise training would increase the expression of proteins involved in lipolysis and glucose uptake in scAT. To test these hypotheses, 19 young and healthy males were randomized to either endurance exercise training (TR; age 18-24 yr; BMI 19.0-25.4 kg/m2) or a nonexercising control group (CON; age 21-35 yr; BMI 20.5-28.8 kg/m2). Abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsies and blood were obtained at rest before and after intervention. By using Western blotting and PCR, we determined expression of lipid droplet-associated proteins, various proteins involved in substrate metabolism, and mRNA abundance of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Adipose tissue insulin sensitivity was determined from fasting plasma insulin and nonesterified fatty acids (adipose tissue insulin resistance index; Adipo-IR). Adipo-IR improved in TR compared with CON ( P = 0.03). This was accompanied by increased insulin receptor (IR) protein expression in scAT with a 1.54-fold (SD 0.79) change from baseline in TR vs. 0.85 (SD 0.30) in CON ( P = 0.007). Additionally, hexokinase II (HKII) and succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA) protein increased in TR compared with CON ( P = 0.006 and P = 0.04, respectively). We did not observe changes in lipid droplet-associated proteins or mRNA abundance of GPCRs. Collectively, 10 weeks of endurance exercise training improved adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, which was accompanied by increased IR, HKII, and SDHA protein expression in scAT. We suggest that these adaptations contribute to an improved metabolic flexibility. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to investigate the molecular adaptations in human subcutaneous adipose tissue (scAT) after endurance exercise training compared with a nonexercising control group. We show that endurance exercise training improves insulin sensitivity in human scAT, and this is accompanied by increased expression of insulin receptor, hexokinase II, and succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A. Collectively, our data suggest that endurance exercise training induces molecular adaptations in human scAT, which may contribute to an improved metabolic flexibility.",-1
Longitudinal White Matter Damage Evolution in Parkinson's Disease,"Background:                    White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have a role in cognitive impairment in normal brain aging, while the effect on Parkinson's disease (PD) progression is still controversial.              Objective:                    To investigate the longitudinal evolution of micro- and macrostructural damage of cerebral white matter (WM) and its relationship with the clinical picture in PD.              Methods:                    A total of 154 PD patients underwent clinical, cognitive, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment once a year for up to 4 years. Sixty healthy controls underwent the same protocol at baseline. WMHs were identified and total WMH volume was measured. WMHs were also used as exclusion masks to define normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Using tract-based spatial statistics, diffusion tensor (DT) MRI metrics of whole-brain WM and NAWM were obtained. Linear mixed-effects models defined the longitudinal evolution and association between variables. WM alterations were tested as risk factors of disease progression using linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models.              Results:                    At baseline, PD patients showed alterations of all DT MRI measures compared to controls. Longitudinally, DT MRI measures did not vary significantly and no association with clinical variables was found. WMH volume changed over time and was associated with impairment in global cognition, executive functions, and language. Baseline WMH volume was a moderate risk factor for progression to mild cognitive impairment.              Conclusions:                    Our study suggests an association between WMHs and cognitive deterioration in PD, whereas WM microstructural damage is a negligible contributor to clinical deterioration. WMHs assessed by MRI can provide an important tool for monitoring the development of cognitive impairment in PD patients. Â© 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",-1
"Long-chain glucomannan supplementation modulates immune responsiveness, as well as intestinal microbiota, and impacts infection of broiler chickens with Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis","The zoonotic pathogen Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (SE) causes severe disease in young chickens. Restriction on antibiotic use requires alternative SE control strategies such as nutritional solutions to improve the resistance of chickens. In this study, chickens were fed long-chain glucomannan (GM) or standard diet and challenged with SE at seven days of age. During 21 days post-infection (dpi), we determined numbers and responsiveness of natural killer (NK) and T cells in ileum and spleen, and SE-specific antibody titers in serum. Microbiota compositions in ileum and caeca were determined, as well as correlations of these with numbers and function of immune cells. Some of the samples in the control group had numerically higher CFUs than the GM-treated group. In addition, the relative abundance of SE based on DNA assessment was significantly lower at 21 dpi upon GM supplementation. At 3 dpi, numbers of intraepithelial NK cells were significantly higher, while activation of intraepithelial NK cells (7 dpi), numbers of intraepithelial cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (14 dpi) and SE-specific antibodies (14 dpi) were numerically higher. Furthermore, relative abundance of the commensal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) significantly increased with GM supplementation post-infection. Higher relative abundance of streptococci was associated with reduced SE in ileal and caecal contents at 21 dpi. Relative abundance of streptococci negatively correlated with SE counts and positively correlated with NK cell activation and SE-specific antibodies, which suggests involvement of the commensal LAB in NK cell responsiveness. These results indicate that GM supplementation modulates the immune system, intestinal microbiota and impacts SE infection of young chickens.",-1

Distinct immunocyte-promoting and adipocyte-generating stromal components coordinate adipose tissue immune and metabolic tenors,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key brakes on the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation that regulates local and systemic metabolic tenor. Breakdown of this regulation promotes type 2 diabetes. The cytokine IL-33 expands and sustains the unique Treg population residing within VAT. Here, relying on single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified the major IL-33 producers in VAT to be particular mesenchymal stromal cell subtypes, related to but distinct from adipocyte progenitor cells. We explored modulation of the VAT stromal cell landscape with physiologic variables such as age and sex, as well as its remodeling in pathogenic states like obesity. Last, we uncovered a VAT Treg:stromal cell negative regulatory loop that keeps the potent effect of IL-33 under rein.",-1
Establishment of Economic Forecasting Model of High-tech Industry Based on Genetic Optimization Neural Network,"Scientific and accurate prediction of high-tech industries is of great practical significance for government departments to grasp the future economic operation and formulate development strategies. In this paper, aiming at some shortcomings of neural network (NN) applied in economic forecasting, GANN was introduced to construct the economic forecasting model of high-tech industry. Genetic algorithm (GA) has simple calculation and strong robustness and can generally ensure convergence to the global optimum, which effectively overcomes the shortcomings of NN using gradient descent method. In order to verify the feasibility of the economic forecasting model in this paper, the comparative experiments of different models are carried out in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has faster convergence speed and greater generalization ability, and the average error rate is reduced to about 1%. The prediction accuracy of this model reached 95.14%, which was about 11.93% higher than the previous model. Applying the economic forecasting model in this paper to the economic forecasting of high-tech industries can provide the means and reference value for the government to formulate regional future economic development plans, forecast, and control the economic growth and development direction.",-1
Protective Effects of Companilactobacillus crustorum MN047 against Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis: A Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Study,"Gut microbiota dysbiosis could aggravate the development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Companilactobacillus crustorum MN047 (CCMN) is a potential gut microbiota-regulating probiotic that could produce multiple novel bacteriocins. In this study, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to verify whether CCMN could alleviate dextran sulfate sodium-induced UC by regulating gut microbiota. Results showed that both CCMN and FMT ameliorated the symptoms of UC, including attenuating the increased disease activity index, shortened colon length, gut barrier damage, and inflammation. Briefly, CCMN and FMT upregulated the expressions of MUCs and tight junctions, downregulated the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, increased fecal short-chain fatty acids, and lowered serum lipopolysaccharides, which were associated with the regulation of gut microbiota (e.g., increased Akkermansia, Blautia, and Ruminococcus levels). These results demonstrated that CCMN could ameliorate UC by modulating gut microbiota and inhibiting the TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway. Therefore, CCMN could be considered as a potential probiotic supplement for ameliorating UC.",-1
Co-Application of Statin and Flavonoids as an Effective Strategy to Reduce the Activity of Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels Kv1.3 and Induce Apoptosis in Human Leukemic T Cell Line Jurkat,"Voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1.3 type are considered a potential new molecular target in several pathologies, including some cancer disorders and COVID-19. Lipophilic non-toxic organic inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels, such as statins and flavonoids, may have clinical applications in supporting the therapy of some cancer diseases, such as breast, pancreas, and lung cancer; melanoma; or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study focuses on the influence of the co-application of statins-simvastatin (SIM) or mevastatin (MEV)-with flavonoids 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), 6-prenylnarigenin (6-PN), xanthohumol (XANT), acacetin (ACAC), or chrysin on the activity of Kv1.3 channels, viability, and the apoptosis of cancer cells in the human T cell line Jurkat. We showed that the inhibitory effect of co-application of the statins with flavonoids was significantly more potent than the effects exerted by each compound applied alone. Combinations of simvastatin with chrysin, as well as mevastatin with 8-prenylnaringenin, seem to be the most promising. We also found that these results correlate with an increased ability of the statin-flavonoid combination to reduce viability and induce apoptosis in cancer cells compared to single compounds. Our findings suggest that the co-application of statins and flavonoids at low concentrations may increase the effectiveness and safety of cancer therapy. Thus, the simultaneous application of statins and flavonoids may be a new and promising anticancer strategy.",-1
S-Acetyl-Glutathione Attenuates Carbon Tetrachloride-Induced Liver Injury by Modulating Oxidative Imbalance and Inflammation,"Liver fibrosis, depending on the stage of the disease, could lead to organ dysfunction and cirrhosis, and no effective treatment is actually available. Emergent proof supports a link between oxidative stress, liver fibrogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction as molecular bases of the pathology. A valid approach to protect against the disease would be to replenish the endogenous antioxidants; thus, we investigated the protective mechanisms of the S-acetyl-glutathione (SAG), a glutathione (GSH) prodrug. Preliminary in vitro analyses were conducted on primary hepatic cells. SAG pre-treatment significantly protected against cytotoxicity induced by CCl4. Additionally, CCl4 induced a marked increase in AST and ALT levels, whereas SAG significantly reduced these levels, reaching values found in the control group. For the in vivo analyses, mice were administered twice a week with eight consecutive intraperitoneal injections of 1 mL/kg CCl4 (diluted at 1:10 in olive oil) to induce oxidative imbalance and liver inflammation. SAG (30 mg/kg) was administered orally for 8 weeks. SAG significantly restored SOD activity, GSH levels and GPx activity, while it strongly reduced GSSG levels, lipid peroxidation and H2O2 and ROS levels in the liver. Additionally, CCl4 induced a decrease in anti-oxidants, including Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO-1, which were restored by treatment with SAG. The increased oxidative stress characteristic on liver disfunction causes the impairment of mitophagy and accumulation of dysfunctional and damaged mitochondria. Our results showed the protective effect of SAG administration in restoring mitophagy, as shown by the increased PINK1 and Parkin expressions in livers exposed to CCl4 intoxication. Thus, the SAG administration showed anti-inflammatory effects decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-1Î² in both serum and liver, and suppressing the TLR4/NFkB pathway. SAG attenuated reduced fibrosis, collagen deposition, hepatocellular damage and organ dysfunction. In conclusion, our results suggest that SAG administration protects the liver from CCl4 intoxication by restoring the oxidative balance, ameliorating the impairment of mitophagy and leading to reduced inflammation.",-1
Î²-cell impairment and clinically meaningful alterations in glycemia in obese youth across the glucose tolerance spectrum,"Background/aims:                    In obese youth, it is not clear what degree of Î²-cell impairment translates to glucose dysregulation commensurate with shifts from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes. We aimed to investigate the quantitative relationship between Î²-cell (clamp-measured disposition index [DI]) and OGTT glucose area under the curve (G-AUC) in obese youth across the spectrum of glucose tolerance.              Methods:                    Data from 152 youth (58 African-American [AA] and 94 American-White [AW]; 73 NGT, 48 IGT, and 31 type 2 diabetes) who completed a 3-h hyperinsulinemic (80 mu/m2/min)-euglycemic clamp, and a 2-h hyperglycemic (225 mg/dL) clamp synchronized with a 2-h OGTT were examined.              Results:                    In IGT vs. NGT, 36% lower DI corresponded to 27% higher G-AUC; in type 2 diabetes vs. IGT, 65% lower DI related to 25% higher G-AUC, and in type 2 diabetes vs. NGT, 78% lower DI paralleled 59% higher G-AUC. Although AA vs. AW youth had larger decrements in DI, from NGT to IGT and from NGT to type 2 diabetes, they displayed comparable increments in G-AUC.              Conclusion:                    At least ~35-50% recovery in Î²-cell function might be needed to have clinically meaningful improvement in G-AUC commensurate with conversion to better glucose tolerance. Mechanism(s) protective against dysglycemia might be operative in AA vs. AW youth despite greater declines in DI. Treatments aiming to improve Î²-cell function should focus on degree of change in DI commensurate with clinically meaningful changes in glycemia, reflective of restoration of glucose tolerance.",-1
Gut Microbiome and Neuroinflammation in Hypertension,"Hypertension is a worldwide problem with major impacts on health including morbidity and mortality, as well as consumption of health care resources. Nearly 50% of American adults have high blood pressure, and this rate is rising. Even with multiple antihypertensive drugs and aggressive lifestyle modifications, blood pressure is inadequately controlled in about 1 of 5 hypertensive individuals. This review highlights a hypothesis for hypertension that suggests alternative mechanisms for blood pressure elevation and maintenance. A better understanding of these mechanisms could open avenues for more successful treatments. The hypothesis accounts for recent understandings of the involvement of gut physiology, gut microbiota, and neuroinflammation in hypertension. It includes bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and gut epithelium in the gut-brain axis that is involved in regulation of autonomic nervous system activity and blood pressure control. Dysfunction of this gut-brain axis, including dysbiosis of gut microbiota, gut epithelial dysfunction, and deranged input to the brain, contributes to hypertension via inflammatory mediators, metabolites, bacteria in the circulation, afferent information alterations, etc resulting in neuroinflammation and unbalanced autonomic nervous system activity that elevates blood pressure. This in turn negatively affects gut function and its microbiota exacerbating the problem. We focus this review on the gut-brain axis hypothesis for hypertension and possible contribution to racial disparities in hypertension. A novel idea, that immunoglobulin A-coated bacteria originating in the gut with access to the brain could be involved in hypertension, is raised. Finally, minocycline, with its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, is evaluated as a potential antihypertensive drug acting on this axis.",-1
Investigating the human jejunal microbiota,"Descriptions of the small intestinal microbiota are deficient and conflicting. We aimed to get a reliable description of the jejunal bacterial microbiota by investigating samples from two separate jejunal segments collected from the luminal mucosa during surgery. Sixty patients with morbid obesity selected for elective gastric bypass surgery were included in this survey. Samples collected by rubbing a swab against the mucosa of proximal and mid jejunal segments were characterized both quantitatively and qualitatively using a combination of microbial culture, a universal quantitative PCR and 16S deep sequencing. Within the inherent limitations of partial 16S sequencing, bacteria were assigned to the species level. By microbial culture, 53 patients (88.3%) had an estimated bacterial density of < 1600 cfu/ml in both segments whereof 31 (51.7%) were culture negative in both segments corresponding to a bacterial density below 160 cfu/ml. By quantitative PCR, 46 patients (76.7%) had less than 104 bacterial genomes/ml in both segments. The most abundant and frequently identified species by 16S deep sequencing were associated with the oral cavity, most often from the Streptococcus mitis group, the Streptococcus sanguinis group, Granulicatella adiacens/para-adiacens, the Schaalia odontolytica complex and Gemella haemolysans/taiwanensis. In general, few bacterial species were identified per sample and there was a low consistency both between the two investigated segments in each patient and between patients. The jejunal mucosa of fasting obese patients contains relatively few microorganisms and a core microbiota could not be established. The identified microbes are likely representatives of a transient microbiota and there is a high degree of overlap between the most frequently identified species in the jejunum and the recently described ileum core microbiota.",-1
A critical review of Astragalus polysaccharides: From therapeutic mechanisms to pharmaceutics,"As the important active ingredients of Astragali Radix (AR), Astragalus polysaccharides (APs) have therapeutic potential for multiple diseases including nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. A large number of cell experiments combined with animal experiments have shed light on the therapeutic mechanisms and therapeutic effects of APs on a variety of diseases. However, the clinical application of APs is not widespread, except for the use of injected APs in the clinical adjuvant therapy of cancer. Due to the excessive molecular weight, bulky, low solubility and negatively charged characteristics, APs have low bioavailability which limits their clinical application. With the deepening of researches on the pharmaceutics of APs, the nanocrystals and moderate structural modification enormously boost the bioavailability, which may expand the application of APs. This review summarizes the studies in pharmacodynamic properties and pharmaceutics of APs, with the purpose of providing experimental researches and clinical application data for expanding the clinical development through expounding the therapeutic mechanisms and pharmaceutical researches of APs.",-1
Clinical and Model-Based Evaluation of the Effect of Glasdegib on Cardiac Repolarization From a Randomized Thorough QT Study,"Glasdegib is a potent, selective oral inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This phase 1 double-blind thorough QT study (NCT03162900) evaluated the effects of glasdegib on QTc interval. The study enrolled 36 healthy volunteers to receive a single dose of 150 mg glasdegib (representing a therapeutic dose), 300 mg glasdegib (representing a supratherapeutic dose), 400 mg moxifloxacin (positive control), or placebo under fasted conditions. The study demonstrated that therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of glasdegib had no significant effect on QTc interval; the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for all time-matched least-squares mean differences in QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) between glasdegib and placebo was below the prespecified criterion of 20 milliseconds (Food and Drug Administration correspondence reviewed and accepted). Based on an exposure-response analysis, glasdegib was determined not to have a meaningful effect on heart rate (change in RR interval). The mean (90%CI) model-derived baseline and placebo-adjusted QTcF at the average maximum observed concentration values corresponding to therapeutic and supratherapeutic glasdegib doses was 7.3 milliseconds (6.5-8.2 milliseconds) and 13.7 milliseconds (12.0-15.5 milliseconds), respectively. Together these results demonstrated that following therapeutic and supratherapeutic glasdegib dosing, the change in QTc from baseline was well below the 20-millisecond threshold of clinical concern in oncology.",-1
Delayed secretory activation and low milk production in women with gestational diabetes: a case series,"Background:                    Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is major pregnancy complication that is associated with short- and long-term consequences for both mother and infant, including increased risk of diabetes later in life. A longer breastfeeding duration has been associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, however, women with GDM are less likely to exclusively breastfeed and have shorter breastfeeding duration. While the timing of breastfeeding initiation and milk removal frequency affects subsequent breastfeeding outcomes, little is known about early infant feeding practices and milk production in women with GDM. This case series offers detailed prospective breastfeeding initiation data, as well as the first report of objective measures of milk production in women with GDM.              Case presentation:                    In this case series, we present the early infant feeding practices of eight women with GDM that gave birth at term gestation. Women recorded the timing of initiation of breastfeeding and secretory activation, as well as their breastfeeding, expression and formula feeding frequencies on postpartum days 1, 7 and 21. Measurement of 24 h milk production volume was performed at 3 weeks postpartum using the test weight method. We observed a delayed first breastfeed (> 1 h) in 6 (75%) cases, formula use in hospital in 5 (63%) cases and delayed secretory activation in 3 (38%) cases. At 3 weeks postpartum, 2 cases had measured milk productions that were insufficient to sustain adequate infant weight gain.              Conclusions:                    Our data suggest that despite early and frequent milk removal, women with GDM are at greater risk of delayed secretory activation and low milk supply. Cohort studies that consider co-morbidities such as obesity are needed to determine the lactation outcomes of women with GDM.",-1
"Effect of fasting and feeding on apolipoprotein A-I kinetics in preÎ² 1-HDL, Î±-HDL, and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins","The aim of this study was to compare the kinetics of apolipoprotein (apo)A-I during fed and fasted states in humans, and to determine to what extent the intestine contributes to apoA-I production. A stable isotope study was conducted to determine the kinetics of apoA-I in preÎ²1 high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and Î±-HDL. Six healthy male subjects received a constant intravenous infusion of 2H3-leucine for 14 h. Subjects in the fed group also received small hourly meals. Blood samples were collected hourly during tracer infusion and then daily for 4 days. Tracer enrichments were measured by mass spectrometry and then fitted to a compartmental model using asymptotic plateau of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) apoB100 and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) apoB48 as estimates of hepatic and intestinal precursor pools, respectively. The clearance rate of preÎ²1-HDL-apoA-I was lower in fed individuals compared with fasted subjects (p < 0.05). No other differences in apoA-I production or clearance rates were observed between the groups. No significant correlation was observed between plasma apoC-III concentrations and apoA-I kinetic data. In contrast, HDL-apoC-III was inversely correlated with the conversion of Î±-HDL to preÎ²1-HDL. Total apoA-I synthesis was not significantly increased in fed subjects. Hepatic production was not significantly different between the fed group (17.17 Â± 2.75 mg/kg/day) and the fasted group (18.67 Â± 1.69 mg/kg/day). Increase in intestinal apoA-I secretion in fed subjects was 2.20 Â± 0.61 mg/kg/day. The HDL-apoA-I kinetics were similar in the fasted and fed groups, with 13% of the total apoA-I originating from the intestine with feeding.",-1
Human placental mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes exhibit anti-inflammatory effects via TLR4-mediated NF-ÎºB/MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways,"Exosomes are a type of nanoparticles in 40-200 nm extracellular vesicles secreted from living cells, containing a plurality of biologically active substances, which can be used as carriers of intercellular delivery signals. Among them, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes have been reported to play important roles in injury repair, alleviating inflammation; thus, MSC-derived exosomes have become hot spot in noncellular therapies. The role of human placental MSC-derived exosomes (hplMSC-Exos) in inflammation and their potential mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of hplMSC-Exos in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells and their intrinsic mechanisms. Our data demonstrated that hplMSCs-Exos can adjust inflammation by regulating TLR4-mediated NF-ÎºB/MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, indicating that hplMSCs-Exos can act as a new strategy for inflammatory treatment.",-1
"Dietary Inflammatory Index and Cross-Sectional Associations with Inflammation, Muscle Mass and Function in Healthy Old Adults","Importance:                    Inflammaging is considered a driver of age-related loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia). As nutrition might play a role in this process, the Dietary Inflammatory IndexÂ® (DII) has been developed to quantify the inflammatory potential of an individual diet.              Objectives:                    We aimed to examine associations between the DII, inflammation, oxidative stress and sarcopenia-related parameters in healthy old compared to young adults.              Design, setting, and participants:                    This cross-sectional study included data of 79 community-dwelling, healthy old adults (65-85 years) and 59 young adults (18-35 years) who participated in a randomized controlled trial from April to December 2019.              Measurements:                    The DII was computed with dietary data collected from 24-h recall interviews. Associations between the DII, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers as well as bioimpedance-derived body composition, handgrip strength and gait speed were determined with multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, physical activity and insulin resistance.              Results:                    Regression analyses revealed significant relationships between a higher interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-6:IL-10-ratio and higher percentage fat mass (%FM), waist-to-height-ratio (WHtR) as well as lower percentage skeletal muscle mass (%SMM) and gait speed exclusively in old adults. Subsequent analyses showed that IL-6 was associated with a pro-inflammatory diet as indicated by a higher DII, again exclusively in old adults (beta coefficient (Î²)= 0.027, standard error (SE) 0.013, p=0.037). While the DII was not related with handgrip strength or oxidative stress in neither old nor young adults, linear models confirmed that a higher DII was inversely associated with gait speed in old participants (Î²= -0.022, SE 0.006, p<0.001). Finally, a pro-inflammatory diet was significantly associated with higher %FM, WHtR and lower %SMM in both age groups.              Conclusion and relevance:                    A pro-inflammatory diet reflected by the DII is associated with higher systemic inflammation, slower gait speed as well as lower muscle mass in old adults. Intervention studies are needed to examine whether anti-inflammatory dietary approaches can help to improve muscle mass and function and thus minimize the risk for sarcopenia in the long-term.",-1
Prognostic Gene Predictors of Gestational Diabetes in Endometrium and Follicular Fluid of Women after Infertility,"Background and objectives. Gestational diabetes mellitus is an increasingly diagnosed metabolic disorder during pregnancy with unknown pathological pathways. Taking into account the growing numbers of women who are conceiving after assisted reproductive technologies, they comprise an engaging target group for gestational diabetes mellitus etiopathogenesis research. In terms of metabolism and genetics, as the evidence shows, both unexplained infertility and gestational diabetes mellitus pose challenges for their interpretation due to the complex bodily processes. Materials and Methods. Our study examined the expression of genes (IGF2, GRB10, CRTC2, HMGA2, ESR1, DLK1, SLC6A15, GPT2, PLAGL1) associated with glucose metabolism in unexplained infertility patients who conceived after in vitro fertilization procedure, were diagnosed with GDM and their findings were compared with control population. Results. There were no significant differences in gene expression of endometrium stromal cells between healthy pregnant women and women with gestational diabetes, although the significant downregulation of CRTC2 was observed in the follicular fluid of women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Moreover, expression of HMGA2 and ESR1 was significantly reduced in FF cells when compared to endometrial cells. Conclusions. These findings may indicate about the importance of follicular fluid as an indicator for gestational diabetes and should be explored more by further research.",-1
The Novel Function of Unsymmetrical Chiral CCN Pincer Nickel Complexes as Chemotherapeutic Agents Targeting Prostate Cancer Cells,"We report that the pincer nickel complexes display prostate cancer antitumor properties through inhibition of cell proliferation. Notably, they display better antitumor properties than cisplatin. Mechanistic studies reveal that these pincer nickel complexes trigger cell apoptosis, most likely due to cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, these complexes also inhibit androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) signaling, which are critical for prostate cancer survival and progression. Our study reveals a novel function of pincer nickel complexes as potential therapeutic drugs in prostate cancer.",-1
Prolactin and breast increase during pregnancy in PCOS: linked to long-term metabolic health?,"Objective To explore whether gestational prolactin and breast increase are markers of metabolic health in pregnancy and on long-term, in PCOS. Design Follow-up study. Women with PCOS, according to the Rotterdam criteria (n = 239), former participants of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) PregMet were invited, 131 participated in the current follow-up study, at mean 8 years after pregnancy. Methods Metformin 2000 mg/day or placebo from first trimester to delivery in the original RCT. No intervention in the current study. Prolactin was analyzed in the first trimester and at gestational week 32 and metabolic characteristics which are part of the metabolic syndrome and measures of glucose homeostasis were examined. Metabolic health was also evaluated according to breast increase versus lack of breast increase during pregnancy. Results Prolactin increase in pregnancy was negatively correlated to BMI (P = 0.007) and systolic blood pressure (P â?0.001) in gestational week 32. Prolactin at gestational week 32 was negatively correlated to BMI (P = 0.044) and visceral fat area (P = 0.028) at 8-year follow-up in an unadjusted model. Prolactin at gestational week 32 showed no associations to metabolic health at follow-up when baseline BMI was adjusted for. Women who reported lack of breast increase during pregnancy, had higher BMI (P = 0.034), waist-hip ratio (P = 0.004), visceral fat area (P = 0.050), total cholesterol (P = 0.022), systolic (P = 0.027) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.011) at 8-year follow-up. Conclusion High prolactin levels and breast increase in pregnancy were associated with a more favorable long-term metabolic health in women with PCOS. Both prolactin and breast increase may be mediated by gestational BMI.",-1
Kindlin-2 Promotes Chondrogenesis and Ameliorates IL-1beta-Induced Inflammation in Chondrocytes Cocultured with BMSCs in the Direct Contact Coculture System,"The osteoarthritis caused by trauma or inflammation is associated with severe patient morbidity and economic burden. Accumulating studies are focusing on the repair of articular cartilage defects by constructing tissue-engineered cartilage. Recent evidence suggests that optimizing the source and quality of seed cells is one of the key points of cartilage tissue engineering. In this study, we demonstrated that Kindlin-2 and its activated PI3K/AKT signaling played an essential role in promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion and ameliorating IL-1beta-induced inflammation in chondrocytes cocultured with bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). In vivo experiments revealed that coculture significantly promoted hyaline cartilage regeneration. In vitro studies further uncovered that chondrocytes cocultured with BMSCs in the direct contact coculture system upregulated Kindlin-2 expression and subsequently activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which not only increases Sox9 and Col2 expression but also restores mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces ROS levels and apoptosis under inflammatory conditions. Overall, our findings indicated that direct contact BMSC-chondrocyte coculture system could promote chondrogenesis, and identified Kindlin-2 represents a key regulator in this process.",-1
Controlling astrocyte-mediated synaptic pruning signals for schizophrenia drug repurposing with deep graph networks,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder, leading to both physical and social morbidity. Worldwide 1% of the population is struggling with the disease, with 100,000 new cases annually only in the United States. Despite its importance, the goal of finding effective treatments for schizophrenia remains a challenging task, and previous work conducted expensive large-scale phenotypic screens. This work investigates the benefits of Machine Learning for graphs to optimize drug phenotypic screens and predict compounds that mitigate abnormal brain reduction induced by excessive glial phagocytic activity in schizophrenia subjects. Given a compound and its concentration as input, we propose a method that predicts a score associated with three possible compound effects, i.e., reduce, increase, or not influence phagocytosis. We leverage a high-throughput screening to prove experimentally that our method achieves good generalization capabilities. The screening involves 2218 compounds at five different concentrations. Then, we analyze the usability of our approach in a practical setting, i.e., prioritizing the selection of compounds in the SWEETLEAD library. We provide a list of 64 compounds from the library that have the most potential clinical utility for glial phagocytosis mitigation. Lastly, we propose a novel approach to computationally validate their utility as possible therapies for schizophrenia.",-1
Phenolic Bioactives From Plant-Based Foods for Glycemic Control,"Plant-based foods containing phenolic bioactives have human health protective functions relevant for combating diet and lifestyle-influenced chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). The molecular structural features of dietary phenolic bioactives allow antioxidant functions relevant for countering chronic oxidative stress-induced metabolic breakdown commonly associated with T2D. In addition to antioxidant properties, phenolic bioactives of diverse plant foods have therapeutic functional activities such as improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic glucose output, inhibiting activity of key carbohydrate digestive enzymes, and modulating absorption of glucose in the bloodstream, thereby subsequently improving post-prandial glycemic control. These therapeutic functional properties have direct implications and benefits in the dietary management of T2D. Therefore, plant-based foods that are rich in phenolic bioactives are excellent dietary sources of therapeutic targets to improve overall glycemic control by managing chronic hyperglycemia and chronic oxidative stress, which are major contributing factors to T2D pathogenesis. However, in studies with diverse array of plant-based foods, concentration and composition of phenolic bioactives and their glycemic control relevant bioactivity can vary widely between different plant species, plant parts, and among different varieties/genotypes due to the different environmental and growing conditions, post-harvest storage, and food processing steps. This has allowed advances in innovative strategies to screen and optimize whole and processed plant derived foods and their ingredients based on their phenolic bioactive linked antioxidant and anti-hyperglycemic properties for their effective integration into T2D focused dietary solutions. In this review, different pre-harvest and post-harvest strategies and factors that influence phenolic bioactive-linked antioxidant and anti-hyperglycemic properties in diverse plant derived foods and derivation of extracts with therapeutic potential are highlighted and discussed. Additionally, novel bioprocessing strategies to enhance bioavailability and bioactivity of phenolics in plant-derived foods targeting optimum glycemic control and associated T2D therapeutic benefits are also advanced.",-1
Determining the Predictors of Self-Management Behaviors in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: An Application of Socio-Ecological Approach,"Background:                    Type 2 diabetes complications are responsible for 2% of hospital emergency visits. Self-management practices are one of the most essential approaches to control type 2 diabetes. The goal of this study was to use an ecological approach to investigate the predictors of self-management behaviors in diabetes patients referred to the emergency department in Ardabil in 2020.              Methods:                    In this cross-sectional study, 273 individuals with type 2 diabetes who were sent to the emergency department of Imam Khomeini Educational and Medical Center in Ardabil were included using the available sample method. Demographic information questionnaires, including the Diabetes Distress Screening Tool (DDS2), General Diabetes Knowledge (DKT2), Diabetes Empowerment Questionnaire (DES-SF), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ 9), Beliefs to Treatment Effectiveness Scale (BTES), Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale (DSES), Chronic Illness Resources Survey (CIRS), Situational Effects Questionnaire, and Diabetes self-management support (DSMS), were all used to collect data. The independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficient, and multiple regression were used to analyze the data.              Results:                    The results of the study showed that in the framework of ecological approach, predictors of self-management behaviors at the four levels are as follows: at the individual level-gender (p = 0.025), education (p = 0.002), duration of diabetes (p = 0.38), having a glucometer at home (p < 0.001), diabetes empowerment (p < 0.001), personal support (p = 0.002), and self-efficacy (p = 0.047); at the interpersonal level-the main health support (p < 0.001), membership in social networks (p < 0.005), family/friends support (p < 0.001), and neighborhoods support (p < 0.001); at the group and organizational level-organizational support (p = 0.013); at the community and policy level-the impact of mass media in health (p < 0.001) and situational influence (p < 0.001).              Conclusion:                    The impact of non-individual levels, such as the environment, on a person's decision to manage diabetes is crucial. Diabetes management necessitates a significant amount of effort, which involves maintaining the health of diabetes patients and the community while also minimizing emergency department workload.",-1
Effect of PPARÎ³ agonist on aerobic exercise capacity in relation to body fat distribution in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease: a 1-yr randomized study,"Targeting metabolic determinants of exercise performance with pharmacological agents that would mimic/potentiate the effects of exercise represents an attractive clinical alternative to counterbalance the poor exercise capacity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We examined the effect of 1-yr treatment with the insulin sensitizer peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)Î³ agonist rosiglitazone on aerobic exercise capacity and body fat composition/distribution in men with T2DM and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). One-hundred four men (age: 64 Â± 7 yr; body mass index: 30.0 Â± 4.4 kg/m2) with T2DM and CAD were randomized to receive rosiglitazone or placebo for 1 yr. Aerobic exercise capacity (exercise duration) was assessed with a maximal treadmill test, and body composition/distribution were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry/computed tomography scans. At 1 yr, patients with T2DM under PPARÎ³ agonist treatment showed a reduction in aerobic exercise capacity compared with the control group (exercise duration change, -31 Â± 8 versus 7 Â± 11 s, P = 0.009). Significant increases in body fat mass (3.1 Â± 0.4 kg, 12%), abdominal and mid-thigh subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) levels, and mid-thigh skeletal muscle fat were found (all P < 0.01), whereas no effect on visceral AT levels was observed (P > 0.05) under treatment. Subcutaneous fat mass gained under PPARÎ³ agonist was the strongest predictor of the worsening in aerobic exercise capacity (P > 0.0001); no association was found with skeletal muscle fat infiltration nor visceral AT. Treatment with the insulin sensitizer PPARÎ³ agonist rosiglitazone in patients with T2DM and CAD is associated with a worsening in aerobic exercise capacity, which seems to be mainly attributable to weight gain and subcutaneous fat mass expansion.",-1
A Feed-Forward Neural Network for Increasing the Hopfield-Network Storage Capacity,"In the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), pattern separation mainly depends on the concepts of 'expansion recoding', meaning random mixing of different DG input channels. However, recent advances in neurophysiology have challenged the theory of pattern separation based on these concepts. In this study, we propose a novel feed-forward neural network, inspired by the structure of the DG and neural oscillatory analysis, to increase the Hopfield-network storage capacity. Unlike the previously published feed-forward neural networks, our bio-inspired neural network is designed to take advantage of both biological structure and functions of the DG. To better understand the computational principles of pattern separation in the DG, we have established a mouse model of environmental enrichment. We obtained a possible computational model of the DG, associated with better pattern separation ability, by using neural oscillatory analysis. Furthermore, we have developed a new algorithm based on Hebbian learning and coupling direction of neural oscillation to train the proposed neural network. The simulation results show that our proposed network significantly expands the storage capacity of Hopfield network, and more effective pattern separation is achieved. The storage capacity rises from 0.13 for the standard Hopfield network to 0.32 using our model when the overlap in patterns is 10%.",-1
"FGF1 ÎHBS delays the progression of diabetic nephropathy in late-stage type 2 diabetes mouse model by alleviating renal inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis","Elderly adults are at higher risk for developing diabetic complications including diabetic nephropathy (DN), contributing to excess morbidity and mortality in elderly individuals. A non-mitogenic variant of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1ÎHBS) was demonstrated to prevent DN in an early-stage (2-month-old) type 2 diabetes (T2D) mouse model. The present study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of FGF1ÎHBS against the progression of renal dysfunction in a late-stage T2D mouse model with established DN. Nine-month-old db/db mice were administered FGF1ÎHBS every other day for 3 months. db/db mice at 12-month-old without FGF1ÎHBS treatment exhibited high blood glucose level and elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. FGF1ÎHBS treatment effectively reversed hyperglycemia, delayed the development of renal dysfunction, and reduced kidney size and weight. Furthermore, FGF1ÎHBS treatment significantly prevented the progression of renal morphologic impairment. FGF1ÎHBS treatment demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, with significantly decreased protein levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-fibrotic factors in kidney. Moreover, FGF1ÎHBS treatment greatly decreased apoptosis of renal tubular cells, accompanied by significant downregulation of the proapoptotic protein and upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±) expression in kidney. Mechanistically, FGF1ÎHBS treatment directly protected mouse proximal tubule cells against palmitate-induced apoptosis, which was abolished by PPARÎ± inhibition. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that FGF1ÎHBS delays the progression of renal dysfunction likely through activating PPARÎ± to prevent renal tubule cell death in late-stage T2D, exhibiting a promising translational potential in treating DN in elderly T2D individuals by ameliorating renal inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis.",-1
"Patterns of Cerebrospinal Fluid Alzheimer's Dementia Biomarkers in People Living with HIV: Cross-Sectional Study on Associated Factors According to Viral Control, Neurological Confounders and Neurocognition","People living with HIV (PLWH) age with an excess burden of comorbidities that may increase the incidence of age-related complications. There is controversy surrounding the hypothesis that HIV can accelerate neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's dementia (AD). We performed a retrospective study to analyze the distribution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers (beta amyloid 1-42 fragment, tau, and phosphorylated tau) in adult PLWH (on cART with undetectable viremia, n = 136, with detectable viremia, n = 121, and with central nervous system CNS disorders regardless of viremia, n = 72) who underwent a lumbar puncture between 2008 to 2018; HIV-negative controls with AD were included (n = 84). Five subjects (1.5%) presented CSF biomarkers that were compatible with AD: one was diagnosed with AD, whereas the others showed HIV encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and neurotoxoplasmosis. Regardless of confounders, 79.6% of study participants presented normal CSF AD biomarkers. Isolated abnormalities in CSF beta amyloid 1-42 (7.9%) and tau (10.9%) were associated with age, biomarkers of intrathecal injury, and inflammation, although no HIV-specific feature was associated with abnormal CSF patterns. CSF levels of AD biomarkers very poorly overlapped between HIV-positive clinical categories and AD controls. Despite the correlations with neurocognitive performance, the inter-relationship between amyloid and tau proteins in PLWH seem to differ from that observed in AD subjects; the main driver of the isolated increase in tau seems represented by non-specific CNS inflammation, whereas the mechanisms underlying isolated amyloid consumption remain unclear.",-1
"Quality by Design Adapted Chemically Engineered Lipid Architectonics for HIV Therapeutics and Intervention: Contriving of Formulation, Appraising the In vitro Parameters and In vivo Solubilization Potential","The present research encompasses a quality by design approach for fabricating lipid architectonics (LA) of an antiretroviral drug (Elvitegravir: EVR) to overcome inherent challenges of EVR to curtail its bioavailability issues. Comparative development strategy employing Box-Behnken design was undertaken between high-pressure homogenization technique and melt emulsification followed by probe sonication method, wherein the later was selected for engineering the EVR-LA. Particle size, entrapment efficiency and drug loading for EVR-LA were 84.6 Â± 2.3 nm, 90.7 Â± 1.8% and 8.9 Â± 0.7% respectively. In vitro release studies established the supremacy of EVR-LA when compared with drug suspension (EVR-DS) by having a cumulative drug release of 96.89 Â± 2.5% in pH 1.2, 89.84 Â± 2.4% in pH 6.8 and 86.64 Â± 2.5% in pH 7.4. Gut permeation studies revealed 19-fold increment in permeation by EVR-LA attributable to intrinsic permeation enhancing and efflux protein inhibitory activity of the lipids and surfactants incorporated. The result was validated by confocal study which exhibited enhanced permeation by EVR-LA. Dissolution study, conducted in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) and fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF) media to ascertain the effect of food, demonstrated boosted absorption from FeSSIF media. Stability study was conducted in SGF pH 1.2, FaSSIF and FeSSIF media. The lipolysis study, conducted to determine in vivo fate of EVR, revealed 27-fold increment in solubilization potential from EVR-LA (72.43 Â± 2.6%). Thus, EVR-LA exhibited remarkable in vitro results by improving gut permeation and solubilization fate along with enhanced lymphatic uptake, thereby leading to prospective in vivo fate.",-1
Tracking the response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in ozone-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mouse models,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is commonly isolated from the sputum of COPD patients. However, the precise role of P. aeruginosa infection in the progression of COPD, especially its role in altering inflammation remains unclear. Here, we designed mice models of COPD infected with P. aeruginosa (PA) and observed dynamic changes of lung structure, lung inflammatory microenvironment, lung function. After infection, the level of mucus secretion peaked on day 3 and remained higher throughout the study period, and the airway remodeling and emphysema was starkly apparent on day 14 and 21. On day 3, interferon-Î³ and interleukin (IL)- 5 levels increased rapidly, accompanied by elevated T-bet mRNA expression and CD4+T-bet+ cells; at the late stage of infection (days 14 and 21), consistent with increased GATA3 mRNA expression and CD4+GATA3+ cells, IL-4 and IL-13 levels significantly increased; IL-17A level, Foxp3 mRNA expression, CD4+ROR-Î³t+ cells and CD4+FOXP3+ cells remained at higher levels throughout the course of the infection. Small-airway function showed a decline from day 3 to day 21; large airway function showed a decline on day 14 and 21. Overall, P. aeruginosa infection contributed to the progression of COPD. During the infection, an early Th1-related inflammation gradually shifted to a later Th2-related inflammation, and small-airway function decline occurred earlier than that of large-airway function. On the basis of infection control, the appropriate use of glucocorticoid might slow disease progression by mitigating the enhanced Th2-related inflammation, and small airways could be also an important treatment target in P. aeruginosa -infected COPD patients.",-1
PSC associated inflammatory bowel disease: a distinct entity,"Introduction:                    Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, chronic, and progressive cholestatic disease involving intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. PSC in many patients results in end-stage liver diseases. Nearly 60% of the PSC patients suffer from concomitant inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Classically, IBDs are divided into two principle types: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, with growing knowledge, PSC-associated IBD (PSC-IBD) seems to be a rather distinct entity with specific genetics, clinical, and microbiota characteristics.              Areas covered:                    In this article, we aim to review the unique characteristics of PSC-IBD from clinical, genetic, and microbiota point of view.              Expert opinion:                    PSC-IBD's unique characteristics contribute to the notion that it could be a distinct entity. Acknowledgment of PSC-IBD as a novel entity necessitates designing new clinical guidelines for diagnosis and developing novel therapies.",-1
Exploiting enzymes as a powerful tool to modulate the gut microbiota,Orally administered enzymes can have profound effects on the composition of the gut microbiota and may serve as an appealing alternative modulating agent. We summarize the three ways through which enzymes can influence the gut microbiota and discuss the challenges in choosing the right enzyme to modulate the gut microbiota.,-1
Parent strategies to support young people experiencing mental health problems in Australia: What is most helpful?,"Parents are a critical resource in supporting young people who live with mental health problems. Qualitative research has identified that parents use a wide range of strategies to provide support. However, parents report being unsure which strategies are likely to be helpful, so often struggle in this role. Presently, little empirical evidence exists to assist parents to decide which strategies are likely to be most helpful. This study aimed to explore the parent-perceived helpfulness of parental strategies to support young people living with mental health problems. Data were collected from February to July of 2018, using a cross-sectional, online, anonymous, self-report survey of participants who identified as parenting a young person (15-24 years) diagnosed with a mental health problem (n = 70). Overall, the strategies perceived as most helpful were practical assistance and personal interactions aimed at promoting positive thoughts and feelings and obtaining appropriate treatment. Least helpful strategies tended to be control-type strategies, aimed at behaviour change. Overall, there was good alignment between strategies' helpfulness and frequency of use, however, there were exceptions. These exceptions are likely reflections of the specific context of particular situations as well as parental uncertainty regarding alternative strategies. Generally, perceptions of strategies' helpfulness were unrelated to parent or child characteristics. However, helpfulness of strategies was associated with parents' satisfaction with their relationship with the young person. Parents' collective experience-based perceptions about the helpfulness of strategies used to support young people experiencing mental health problems can be harnessed to inform mental health practitioners' advice to parents and contribute to better mental health outcomes for young people.",-1
Aedes aegypti dyspepsia encodes a novel member of the SLC16 family of transporters and is critical for reproductive fitness,"As a key vector for major arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya, control of Aedes aegypti represents a major challenge in public health. Bloodmeal acquisition is necessary for the reproduction of vector mosquitoes and pathogen transmission. Blood contains potentially toxic amounts of iron while it provides nutrients for mosquito offspring; disruption of iron homeostasis in the mosquito may therefore lead to novel control strategies. We previously described a potential iron exporter in Ae. aegypti after a targeted functional screen of ZIP (zinc-regulated transporter/Iron-regulated transporter-like) and ZnT (zinc transporter) family genes. In this study, we performed an RNAseq-based screen in an Ae. aegypti cell line cultured under iron-deficient and iron-excess conditions. A subset of differentially expressed genes were analyzed via a cytosolic iron-sensitive dual-luciferase reporter assay with several gene candidates potentially involved in iron transport. In vivo gene silencing resulted in significant reduction of fecundity (egg number) and fertility (hatch rate) for one gene, termed dyspepsia. Silencing of dyspepsia reduced the induction of ferritin expression in the midgut and also resulted in delayed/impaired excretion and digestion. Further characterization of this gene, including a more direct confirmation of its substrate (iron or otherwise), could inform vector control strategies as well as to contribute to the field of metal biology.",-1
Converting endogenous genes of the malaria mosquito into simple non-autonomous gene drives for population replacement,"Gene drives for mosquito population replacement are promising tools for malaria control. However, there is currently no clear pathway for safely testing such tools in endemic countries. The lack of well-characterized promoters for infection-relevant tissues and regulatory hurdles are further obstacles for their design and use. Here we explore how minimal genetic modifications of endogenous mosquito genes can convert them directly into non-autonomous gene drives without disrupting their expression. We co-opted the native regulatory sequences of three midgut-specific loci of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae to host a prototypical antimalarial molecule and guide-RNAs encoded within artificial introns that support efficient gene drive. We assess the propensity of these modifications to interfere with the development of Plasmodium falciparum and their effect on fitness. Because of their inherent simplicity and passive mode of drive such traits could form part of an acceptable testing pathway of gene drives for malaria eradication.",-1
Optimal release programs for dengue prevention using Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transinfected with wMel or wMelPop Wolbachia strains,"In this paper, we propose a dengue transmission model of SIR(S)-SI type that accounts for two sex-structured mosquito populations: the wild mosquitoes (males and females that are Wolbachia-free), and those deliberately infected with either wMel or wMelPop strain of Wolbachia. This epidemiological model has four possible outcomes: with or without Wolbachia and with or without dengue. To reach the desired outcome, with Wolbachia and without dengue, we employ the dynamic optimization approach and then design optimal programs for releasing Wolbachia-carrying male and female mosquitoes. Our discussion is focused on advantages and drawbacks of two Wolbachia strains, wMelPop and wMel, that are recommended for dengue prevention and control. On the one hand, the wMel strain guarantees a faster population replacement, ensures durable Wolbachia persistence in the wild mosquito population, and requiters fewer releases. On the other hand, the wMelPop strain displays better results for averting dengue infections in the human population.",-1
A membrane and blood-free approach to rear adult Aedes albopictus,"Most artificial dietary systems for feeding mosquitoes require a membrane feeder, host cues, phosphate saline buffers and a phagostimulant. These multicomponent feeders are complex, expansive and cumbersome that requires fully trained personnel. The objective of the present is to develop a simple sugar assisted protein (SAP) diet for the egg production of Aedes albopictus. The present study assessed the potential use of SAP dietary system on the engorgement, fecundity, preference of diet components and production of multiple generations of Ae. albopictus. Our data show that the female mosquitoes have strongly preferred a diet with: (i) a combination of sugar and protein over the individual component, and (ii) water over PBS (phosphate buffered saline) buffer as a carrier, whereas adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was not required as a phagostimulant. Based on our optimization data, the SAP diets (10-20% bovine serum albumin in 5% sucrose aqueous solution) do not require chemo-attractive lure, phagostimulant ATP, temperature and membrane feeding components. Female mosquitoes readily engorge on SAP diets and show similar rates of survival and fecundity compared to those when blood-fed on live animals. In addition, the number of eggs produced by female mosquitoes fed on SAP diets kept consistent for 10 consecutive generations. Our results indicate that SAP diet is a potential alternative against blood feeding that is simple and cost-effective diets for Ae. albopictus colony maintenance and to support large scale mass- production for experimental and other purposes.",-1
Advancements in Algorithms and Neuromorphic Hardware for Spiking Neural Networks,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have experienced a rapid advancement for their success in various application domains, including autonomous driving and drone vision. Researchers have been improving the performance efficiency and computational requirement of ANNs inspired by the mechanisms of the biological brain. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) provide a power-efficient and brain-inspired computing paradigm for machine learning applications. However, evaluating large-scale SNNs on classical von Neumann architectures (central processing units/graphics processing units) demands a high amount of power and time. Therefore, hardware designers have developed neuromorphic platforms to execute SNNs in and approach that combines fast processing and low power consumption. Recently, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been considered promising candidates for implementing neuromorphic solutions due to their varied advantages, such as higher flexibility, shorter design, and excellent stability. This review aims to describe recent advances in SNNs and the neuromorphic hardware platforms (digital, analog, hybrid, and FPGA based) suitable for their implementation. We present that biological background of SNN learning, such as neuron models and information encoding techniques, followed by a categorization of SNN training. In addition, we describe state-of-the-art SNN simulators. Furthermore, we review and present FPGA-based hardware implementation of SNNs. Finally, we discuss some future directions for research in this field.",-1
Unraveling mosquito metabolism with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics,"Nearly half a million people die annually due to mosquito-borne diseases. Despite aggressive mosquito population-control efforts, current strategies are limited in their ability to control these vectors. A better understanding of mosquito metabolism through modern approaches can contribute to the discovery of novel metabolic targets and/or regulators and lead to the development of better mosquito-control strategies. Currently, cutting-edge technologies such as gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics are considered 'mature technologies' in many life-science disciplines but are still an emerging area of research in medical entomology. This review primarily discusses recent developments and progress in the application of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to answer multiple biological questions related to mosquito metabolism.",-1
The effect of chemical exudates of three larvivorous fish species on oviposition preference of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae),"Mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are vectors of dengue worldwide. Mosquito vector control through maintaining larvivorous fish in water bodies is generally suggested, however, its underlying role towards oviposition preference of these dengue vectors is unknown in the Sri Lankan context. The current study investigated the effect of chemical exudates from larvivorous fish species Poecilia reticulata, Rasbora daniconius and Applocheilus dayi on the oviposition preference of Aedes mosquitoes. The number of eggs laid by each mosquito species was determined using ovitraps that contained water conditioned by the fish species both separately and in combination. The ovitraps were placed inside insect cages containing engorged gravid Aedes females. Both the mosquito species had the least preference of oviposition in water conditioned by A. dayi followed by R. daniconius. The highest preference of oviposition was shown for water conditioned by P. reticulata. The current study indicated that oviposition site selection in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus was reduced by A. dayi and R. daniconius, however, it was not influenced by the fish combinations used. Further studies are warranted to understand the chemical cues associated with larvivorous fish towards the oviposition preference in Aedes mosquitoes.",-1
Sorafenib in Metastatic Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma with BRAF K601E Mutation on Liquid Biopsy: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) includes papillary and follicular carcinomas and is the most common type of thyroid cancer. The incidence of this cancer has increased in the last few years, and even if its prognosis is generally good for a subset of patients that does not respond to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, the prognosis is much worse: the median overall survival (OS) from discovery of metastasis is 3-5 years and the 10-year survival rate is only 10%. Several mutations, including RAS or RET, as well as BRAF signaling, are associated with thyroid cancer. Liquid biopsy may be useful in selected patient to identify genomic alterations and thus allowing for a precision medicine approach with target therapy. Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, can be used in the treatment of DTC. Case presentation: A 77 years old. man with diagnosis of metastatic DTC and evidence of presence of mutation of BRAF K601E on liquid biopsy was treated with sorafenib, showing a good response to the treatment and an improvement in the quality of life (QoL). Currently, this patient is still on treatment with sorafenib, gaining control of a multi-metastatic disease, generally characterized by a very poor prognosis. In conclusion, sorafenib has an active role in the treatment of DTC. It also has been considered the standard of care for patients with advanced unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In our case we observe the efficacy of using sorafenib in Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) such as confirming both stable disease (SD) in the CT scan as clinical benefit with an increase in QoL. Therefore, use of sorafenib remains an important treatment option, even in case of BRAF mutation, despite a rapidly evolving treatment landscape. It also seems important to perform liquid biopsies, especially in patients in whom it is not possible to repeat a new tissue biopsy. Ongoing clinical trials continue to evaluate sorafenib in different settings, and in combination with other therapies in DTC and HCC.",-1
"Correlation of Immunological and Molecular Profiles with Response to Crizotinib in Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma: An Exploratory Study Related to the EORTC 90101 ""CREATE"" Trial","Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare subtype of soft tissue sarcoma characterized by an unbalanced translocation, resulting in ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion that transcriptionally upregulates MET expression. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 90101 ""CREATE"" phase II trial evaluated the MET inhibitor crizotinib in ASPS patients, achieving only limited antitumor activity. We performed a comprehensive molecular analysis of ASPS tissue samples collected in this trial to identify potential biomarkers correlating with treatment outcome. A tissue microarray containing 47 ASPS cases was used for the characterization of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescence. DNA isolated from 34 available tumor samples was analyzed to detect recurrent gene copy number alterations (CNAs) and mutations by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. Pathway enrichment analysis was used to identify diseased-associated pathways in ASPS sarcomagenesis. Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox regression, and the Fisher's exact test were used to correlate histopathological and molecular findings with clinical data related to crizotinib treatment, aiming to identify potential factors associated with patient outcome. Tumor microenvironment characterization showed the presence of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 in 10 and 2 tumors, respectively, and the absence of PD-1 in all specimens. Apart from CD68, other immunological markers were rarely expressed, suggesting a low level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in ASPS. By CNA analysis, we detected a number of broad and focal alterations. The most common alteration was the loss of chromosomal region 1p36.32 in 44% of cases. The loss of chromosomal regions 1p36.32, 1p33, 1p22.2, and 8p was associated with shorter progression-free survival. Using whole-exome sequencing, 13 cancer-associated genes were found to be mutated in at least three cases. Pathway enrichment analysis identified genetic alterations in NOTCH signaling, chromatin organization, and SUMOylation pathways. NOTCH4 intracellular domain dysregulation was associated with poor outcome, while inactivation of the beta-catenin/TCF complex correlated with improved outcome in patients receiving crizotinib. ASPS is characterized by molecular heterogeneity. We identify genetic aberrations potentially predictive of treatment outcome during crizotinib therapy and provide additional insights into the biology of ASPS, paving the way to improve treatment approaches for this extremely rare malignancy.",-1
Single-cell multiomics in neuroinflammation,"The central nervous system (CNS) is, more than other organs, particularly vulnerable to inflammation and immune responses must be tightly controlled in order to maintain host protection. Accordingly, neuroinflammation is an orchestrated process involving various cell types that may dramatically change their phenotypic and functional properties upon entering the CNS. Recent advances in single-cell multiomics offer the unique opportunity to resolve this cellular heterogeneity in a holistic fashion and reshape our understanding of the molecular and cellular processes during neuroinflammation. Here, we provide an overview of technical advances in single-cell multiomics and the tremendous impact on our basic understanding of neuroinflammation. We discuss insights obtained in neuroinflammatory diseases and elaborate to which extent these tool sets could be applied in a clinical setting.",-1
Curcumin Derivative C66 Suppresses Pancreatic Cancer Progression through the Inhibition of JNK-Mediated Inflammation,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is by far the deadliest type of cancer. Inflammation is one of the important risk factors in tumor development. However, it is not yet clear whether deterioration in pancreatic cancer patients is related to inflammation, as well as the underlying mechanism. In addition, JNK is abnormally activated in pancreatic cancer cells and the JNK inhibitor C66 reduces the inflammatory microenvironment in the tumor. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of C66 in the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer. Our results showed that various inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, and IL-15, were more expressed in pancreatic cancer than in the matching normal tissue. Furthermore, C66, a curcumin analogue with good anti-inflammatory activity, inhibited the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, and effectively inhibited the expression of the above inflammatory factors. Our previous research demonstrated that C66 prevents the inflammatory response by targeting JNK. Therefore, in this study, JNK activity in pancreatic cancer cells was investigated, revealing that JNK was highly activated, and the treatment with C66 inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK. Next, shJNK was used to knockdown JNK expression in pancreatic cancer cells to further confirm the role of JNK in the proliferation and migration of this tumor, as well as in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME). The results demonstrated that JNK knockdown could significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer. Moreover, the low JNK expression in pancreatic cancer cells significantly inhibited the expression of various inflammatory factors. These results indicated that C66 inhibited the progression of pancreatic cancer through the inhibition of JNK-mediated inflammation.",-1
Adipose Tissue Senescence and Inflammation in Aging is Reversed by the Young Milieu,"Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation plays a central role in longevity and multiple age-related disorders. Cellular senescence (SEN) is a fundamental aging mechanism that contributes to age-related chronic inflammation and organ dysfunction, including VAT. Recent studies using heterochronic parabiosis models strongly suggested that circulating factors in young plasma alter the aging phenotypes of old animals. Our study investigated if young plasma rescued SEN phenotypes in the VAT of aging mice. With heterochronic parabiosis model using young (3 months) and old (18 months) mice, we found significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered adipokine profile that are protective of SEN in the VAT of old mice. These data are indicative of protection from SEN of aging VAT by young blood circulation. Old parabionts also exhibited diminished expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKi) genes p16 (Cdkn2a) and p21 (Cdkn1a/Cip1) in the VAT. In addition, when exposed to young serum condition in an ex vivo culture system, aging adipose tissue-derived stromovascular fraction cells produced significantly lower amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines (MCP-1 and IL-6) compared to old condition. Expressions of p16 and p21 genes were also diminished in the old stromovascular fraction cells under young serum condition. Finally, in 3T3-preadipocytes culture system, we found reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (Mcp-1 and Il-6) and diminished expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes in the presence of young serum compared to old serum. In summary, this study demonstrates that young milieu is capable of protecting aging adipose tissue from SEN and thereby inflammation.",-1
Identification of new Anopheles gambiae transcriptional enhancers using a cross-species prediction approach,"The success of transgenic mosquito vector control approaches relies on well-targeted gene expression, requiring the identification and characterization of a diverse set of mosquito promoters and transcriptional enhancers. However, few enhancers have been characterized in Anopheles gambiae to date. Here, we employ the SCRMshaw method we previously developed to predict enhancers in the A. gambiae genome, preferentially targeting vector-relevant tissues such as the salivary glands, midgut and nervous system. We demonstrate a high overall success rate, with at least 8 of 11 (73%) tested sequences validating as enhancers in an in vivo xenotransgenic assay. Four tested sequences drive expression in either the salivary gland or the midgut, making them directly useful for probing the biology of these infection-relevant tissues. The success of our study suggests that computational enhancer prediction should serve as an effective means for identifying A. gambiae enhancers with activity in tissues involved in malaria propagation and transmission.",-1
MiR-21 modulates proliferation and apoptosis of human airway smooth muscle cells by regulating autophagy via PARP-1/AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway,"Superfluous human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cell proliferation is an important pathological feature of airway remodelling in asthma. This study aimed to determine whether miR-21 is involved in the regulation of HASM cell survival. Overexpressed miR-21 inhibited HASM cell apoptosis and autophagy and promoted proliferation, whereas a miR-21 inhibitor exerted the opposite effects (P < 0.05). Overexpressed poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HASM cells (P < 0.05). Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that miR-21 directly targeted poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) mRNA (P < 0.05). Silencing PARP-1 based on miR-21 downregulation mimicked the role of 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an autophagy inhibitor (P < 0.05). Overexpressed PARP-1 reversed the effects of miR-21 on HASM cells, somewhat dependently on PARP-1-induced enhanced autophagy, which we elucidated by 3-MA block (P < 0.05). MicroRNA-21 mimics reduced AMPK and increased mTOR signalling by downregulating PARP-1, and a miR-21 inhibitor exerted the opposite effects (P < 0.05). Collectively, miR-21 inhibitor could upregulate PARP-1 in HASM cells to promote autophagy and thus inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis that might be mediated by the AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway.",-1
[Research advances on mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in promoting angiogenesis of diabetic ulcers],"Extracellular vesicles are nanoparticles secreted by most eukaryotic cells and play important roles in material transport and information transmission between cells, involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, antigen presentation, cell apoptosis, cell differentiation, and other biological processes. The culture supernatant of mesenchymal stem cells is rich in extracellular vesicles, and the extracellular vesicles can regulate the formation of new blood vessels, a key step in wound healing and tissue repair. The persistence of diabetic ulcers is closely related to the blocked formation of wound vascular network. This article reviews the role of extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells in promoting angiogenesis of diabetic ulcers, in order to provide a new idea for the treatment of diabetic ulcers.",-1
Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Twitter Data Streams Using Deep Belief Neural Networks,"Social media is Internet-based by design, allowing people to share content quickly via electronic means. People can openly express their thoughts on social media sites such as Twitter, which can then be shared with other people. During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, public opinion analytics provided useful information for determining the best public health response. At the same time, the dissemination of misinformation, aided by social media and other digital platforms, has proven to be a greater threat to global public health than the virus itself, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. The public's feelings on social distancing can be discovered by analysing articulated messages from Twitter. The automated method of recognizing and classifying subjective information in text data is known as sentiment analysis. In this research work, we have proposed to use a combination of preprocessing approaches such as tokenization, filtering, stemming, and building N-gram models. Deep belief neural network (DBN) with pseudo labelling is used to classify the tweets. Top layers of the base classifiers are boosted in the pseudo labelling strategy, whereas lower levels of the base classifiers share weights for feature extraction. By introducing the pseudo boost mechanism, our suggested technique preserves the same time complexity as a DBN while achieving fast convergence to optimality. The pseudo labelling improves the performance of the classification. It extracts the keywords from the tweets with high precision. The results reveal that using the DBN classifier in conjunction with the bigram in the N-gram model outperformed other models by 90.3 percent. The proposed approach can also aid medical professionals and decision-makers in determining the best course of action for each location based on their views regarding the pandemic.",-1
The efficacy of fasting regimens on health outcomes: a systematic overview,"Introduction:                    Fasting can be defined as abstinence or reduction from food, drink, or both, for a defined period. There are many different types of fasting regimens, such as Ramadan fasting, intermittent fasting, Christian Orthodox fasting. The aim of this overview is to provide an exhaustive summary on the beneficial effects and harms associated with fasting regimens and discuss mechanisms by which this non-pharmacological approach might lead to improve human health.              Evidence acquisition:                    A systematic search was performed on MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library and CINHAL. We included systematic reviews (SRs) that report on impact of different types of fasting regimens on health. Selection of SRs, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate.              Evidence synthesis:                    A total of 21 SRs were included. Cumulatively, 97 health outcomes were identified. Of them, cardiovascular risk factors were the most frequently analyzed. Ramadan fasting is associated with significant improvements in body weight and visceral lean mass, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and with reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and total cholesterol (T-chol), especially in cardiac patients. Similarly, reviews on Intermittent and Orthodox fasting proved benefits of those on weight, BMI, lipidic and glucose profile, inflammatory markers.              Conclusions:                    Fasting regimens showed potential beneficial effects on several health indicators in adult populations. Nevertheless, evidence on some specific health dimensions (cognitive function, well-being, quality of life) is limited. Thus, in the future, further RCTs or cohort studies with good methodological quality and larger sample sizes are warranted to better understand the underlying biological mechanism and the benefits on multidimensional aspects of health.",-1
The Novel Competing Endogenous Long Noncoding RNA SM2 Regulates Gonadotropin Secretion in the Hu Sheep Anterior Pituitary by Targeting the Oar-miR-16b/TGF-Î²/SMAD2 Signaling Pathway,"Pituitary gonadotropins play a pivotal role in reproduction. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as important regulators in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis associated with reproduction. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to pituitary gonadotropin secretion remain largely unknown. Therefore, this work was performed to uncover the functional mechanisms of the novel lncRNA TCONS_00083279 (lncRNA SM2) and its potential targeting pathway oar-miR-16b/TGF-beta/SMAD2, which is associated with gonadotropin secretion in sheep pituitary cells. In the present study, the lncRNA SM2 showed high expression levels in the sheep pituitary gland, and it was located in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of pituitary cells. lncRNA SM2 knockdown inhibited pituitary cell proliferation and FSH and LH secretion. The function of the lncRNA SM2 was sponged by oar-miR-16b, and this regulated the growth and gonadotropin secretion of pituitary cells by modulating SMAD2, as shown by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. FSH and LH levels were both upregulated by SMAD2 overexpression. Moreover, the levels of the lncRNA SM2, SMAD2 and TGFR1, as well as FSH and LH, in sheep pituitary cells increased significantly under gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation (p &lt; 0.05). This work illustrates that the lncRNA SM2 regulates gonadotropin secretion in the Hu sheep anterior pituitary by targeting the oar-miR-16b/TGF-Î²/SMAD2 signaling pathway, providing a valuable resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying sheep reproduction.",-1
Laboratory demonstration of the vertical transmission of Rift Valley fever virus by Culex tarsalis mosquitoes,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus with proven ability to emerge into naÃ¯ve geographic areas. Limited field evidence suggests that RVFV is transmitted vertically from parent mosquito to offspring, but until now this mechanism has not been confirmed in the laboratory. Furthermore, this transmission mechanism has allowed for the prediction of RVFV epizootics based on rainfall patterns collected from satellite information. However, in spite of the relevance to the initiation of epizootic events, laboratory confirmation of vertical transmission has remained an elusive research aim for thirty-five years. Herein we present preliminary evidence of the vertical transmission of RVFV by Culex tarsalis mosquitoes after oral exposure to RVFV. Progeny from three successive gonotrophic cycles were reared to adults, with infectious RVFV confirmed in each developmental stage. Virus was detected in ovarian tissues of parental mosquitoes 7 days after imbibing an infectious bloodmeal. Infection was confirmed in progeny as early as the first gonotrophic cycle, with infection rates ranging from 2.0-10.0%. Virus titers among progeny were low, which may indicate a host mechanism suppressing replication.",-1
Automatic segmentation model of intercondylar fossa based on deep learning: a novel and effective assessment method for the notch volume,"Background:                    Notch volume is associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Manual tracking of intercondylar notch on MR images is time-consuming and laborious. Deep learning has become a powerful tool for processing medical images. This study aims to develop an MRI segmentation model of intercondylar fossa based on deep learning to automatically measure notch volume, and explore its correlation with ACL injury.              Methods:                    The MRI data of 363 subjects (311 males and 52 females) with ACL injuries incurred during non-contact sports and 232 subjects (147 males and 85 females) with intact ACL were retrospectively analyzed. Each layer of intercondylar fossa was manually traced by radiologists on axial MR images. Notch volume was then calculated. We constructed an automatic segmentation system based on the architecture of Res-UNet for intercondylar fossa and used dice similarity coefficient (DSC) to compare the performance of segmentation systems by different networks. Unpaired t-test was performed to determine differences in notch volume between ACL-injured and intact groups, and between males and females.              Results:                    The DSCs of intercondylar fossa based on different networks were all more than 0.90, and Res-UNet showed the best performance. The notch volume was significantly lower in the ACL-injured group than in the control group (6.12 Â± 1.34 cm3 vs. 6.95 Â± 1.75 cm3, P < 0.001). Females had lower notch volume than males (5.41 Â± 1.30 cm3 vs. 6.76 Â± 1.51 cm3, P < 0.001). Males and females who had ACL injuries had smaller notch than those with intact ACL (p < 0.001 and p < 0.005). Men had larger notches than women, regardless of the ACL injuries (p < 0.001).              Conclusion:                    Using a deep neural network to segment intercondylar fossa automatically provides a technical support for the clinical prediction and prevention of ACL injury and re-injury after surgery.",-1
Machine learning on thyroid disease: a review,"This study reviews the recent progress of machine learning for the early diagnosis of thyroid disease. Based on the results of this review, different machine learning methods would be appropriate for different types of data for the early diagnosis of thyroid disease: (1) the random forest and gradient boosting in the case of numeric data; (2) the random forest in the case of genomic data; (3) the random forest and the ensemble in the case of radiomic data; and (4) the random forest in the case of ultrasound data. Their performance measures varied within 64.3-99.5 for accuracy, 66.8-90.1 for sensitivity, 61.8-85.5 for specificity, and 64.0-96.9 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the findings of this review, indeed, the following attributes would be important variables for the early diagnosis of thyroid disease: clinical stage, marital status, histological type, age, nerve injury symptom, economic income, surgery type [the quality of life 3 months after thyroid cancer surgery]; tumor diameter, symptoms, extrathyroidal extension [the local recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma]; RNA feasures including ADD3-AS1 (downregulation), MIR100HG (downregulation), FAM95C (downregulation), MORC2-AS1 (downregulation), LINC00506 (downregulation), ST7-AS1 (downregulation), LOC339059 (downregulation), MIR181A2HG (upregulation), FAM181A-AS1 (downregulation), LBX2-AS1 (upregulation), BLACAT1 (upregulation), hsa-miR-9-5p (downregulation), hsa-miR-146b-3p (upregulation), hsa-miR-199b-5p (downregulation), hsa-miR-4709-3p (upregulation), hsa-miR-34a-5p (upregulation), hsa-miR-214-3p (downregulation) [papillary thyroid carcinoma]; gut microbiota RNA features such as veillonella, paraprevotella, neisseria, rheinheimera [hypothyroidism]; and ultrasound features, i.e., wreath-shaped feature, micro-calcification, strain ratio [the malignancy of thyroid nodules].",-1
Basal ganglia atrophy-associated causal structural network degeneration in Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. A convergent pathophysiological hallmark of PD is an early selective vulnerability within the basal ganglia circuit. However, the causal interactions between basal ganglia atrophy and progressive structural network alterations in PD remain unaddressed. Here, we adopted voxel-based morphometry method to measure gray matter (GM) volume for each participant (n = 84 PD patients and n = 70 matched healthy controls). Patients were first divided into three stages according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) and the Part III of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores respectively to analyze the stage-specific GM atrophy patterns. Then, the modulation of early caudate atrophy over other brain structures was evaluated using the whole-brain voxel-wise and region-of-interest-wise causal structural covariance network approaches. We found that GM atrophy progressively expands from the basal ganglia to the angular gyrus, temporal areas, and eventually spreads through the subcortical-cortical networks as PD progresses. Notably, we identified a shared caudate-associated degeneration network including the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, sensorimotor cortex, and cortical association areas with the PD progressive factors. These findings suggest that the early structural vulnerability of basal ganglia in PD may play a pivotal role in the modulation of motor and non-motor circuits at the structural level. Our work provides evidence for a novel mechanism of network degeneration that underlies the pathology of PD and may have potential clinical applications in the development of early predictors of PD onset and progress.",-1
Independent association of plasma xanthine oxidoreductase activity with serum uric acid level based on stable isotope-labeled xanthine and liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry: MedCity21 health examination registry,"Background We developed a novel high-sensitive assay for plasma xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity that is not affected by the original serum uric acid level. However, the association of plasma XOR activity with that level has not been fully examined. Methods This cross-sectional study included 191 subjects (91 males, 100 females) registered in the MedCity21 health examination registry. Plasma XOR activity was determined using our assay for plasma XOR activity with [13C2,15N2] xanthine and liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Serum levels of uric acid and adiponectin, and visceral fat area (VFA) obtained by computed tomography were measured, and insulin resistance was determined based on the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index. Results The median values for uric acid and plasma XOR activity were 333 Î¼mol/L and 26.1 pmol/h/mL, respectively. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed a significant and positive association of serum uric acid level (coefficient: 26.503; 95% confidence interval: 2.06, 50.945; p = 0.035) with plasma XOR activity independent of VFA and HOMA-IR, and also age, gender, alcohol drinking habit, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), glycated hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride, and adiponectin levels. The ""gender*XOR activity"" interaction was not significant (p = 0.91), providing no evidence that gender modifies the relationship between plasma XOR activity and serum uric acid level. Conclusions Plasma XOR activity was found to be positively associated with serum uric acid level independent of other known confounding factors affecting that level, including gender difference, eGFR, adiponectin level, VFA, and HOMA-IR.",-1
Aggressive organ penetration and high vector transmissibility of epidemic dengue virus-2 Cosmopolitan genotype in a transmission mouse model,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever and severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes. The incidence of DENV infection has been gradually increasing in recent years due to global urbanization and international travel. Understanding the virulence determinants in host and vector transmissibility of emerging epidemic DENV will be critical to combat potential outbreaks. The DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2), which caused a widespread outbreak in Taiwan in 2015 (TW2015), is of the Cosmopolitan genotype and is phylogenetically related to the virus strain linked to another large outbreak in Indonesia in 2015. We found that the TW2015 virus was highly virulent in type I and type II interferon-deficient mice, with robust replication in spleen, lung, and intestine. The TW2015 virus also had high transmissibility to Aedes mosquitoes and could be effectively spread in a continuous mosquitoes-mouse-mosquitoes-mouse transmission cycle. By making 16681-based mutants carrying different segments of the TW2015 virus, we identified the structural pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes as key virulence determinants in the host, with involvement in the high transmissibility of the TW2015 virus in mosquitoes. The transmission mouse model will make a useful platform for evaluation of DENV with high epidemic potential and development of new strategies against dengue outbreaks.",-1
Fasting and surgery timing (FaST) audit,"Background & aims:                    International guidance advocates the avoidance of prolonged preoperative fasting due to its negative impact on perioperative hydration. This study aimed to assess the adherence to these guidelines for fasting in patients undergoing elective and emergency surgery in the East Midlands region of the UK.              Methods:                    This prospective audit was performed over a two-month period at five National Health Service (NHS) Trusts across the East Midlands region of the UK. Demographic data, admission and operative details, and length of preoperative fasting were collected on adult patients listed for emergency and elective surgery.              Results:                    Of the 343 surgical patients included within the study, 50% (n = 172) were male, 78% (n = 266) had elective surgery and 22% (n = 77) underwent emergency surgery. Overall median fasting times (Q1, Q3) were 16.1 (13.0, 19.4) hours for food and 5.8 (3.5, 10.7) hours for clear fluids. Prolonged fasting >12 h was documented in 73% (n = 250) for food, and 21% (n = 71) for clear fluids. Median fasting times from clear fluids and food were longer in the those undergoing emergency surgery when compared with those undergoing elective surgery: 13.0 (6.4, 22.6) vs. 4.9 (3.3, 7.8) hours, and 22.0 (14.0, 37.4) vs. 15.6 (12.9, 17.8) hours respectively, p < 0.0001.              Conclusions:                    Despite international consensus on the duration of preoperative fasting, patients continue to fast from clear fluids and food for prolonged lengths of time. Patients admitted for emergency surgery were more likely to fast for longer than those having elective surgery.",-1
Discovering Common Pathophysiological Processes between COVID-19 and Cystic Fibrosis by Differential Gene Expression Pattern Analysis,"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect mammals and birds. Coronaviruses cause infections of the respiratory system in humans, which can be minor or fatal. A comparative transcriptomic analysis has been performed to establish essential profiles of the gene expression of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) linked to cystic fibrosis (CF). Transcriptomic studies have been carried out in relation to SARS-CoV-2 since a number of people have been diagnosed with CF. The recognition of differentially expressed genes demonstrated 8 concordant genes shared between the SARS-CoV-2 and CF. Extensive gene ontology analysis and the discovery of pathway enrichment demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 response to CF. The gene ontological terms and pathway enrichment mechanisms derived from this research may affect the production of successful drugs, especially for the people with the following disorder. Identification of TF-miRNA association network reveals the interconnection between TF genes and miRNAs, which may be effective to reveal the other influenced disease that occurs for SARS-CoV-2 to CF. The enrichment of pathways reveals SARS-CoV-2-associated CF mostly engaged with the type of innate immune system, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, intestinal immune network for IgA production, mineral absorption, autoimmune thyroid disease, legionellosis, viral myocarditis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), etc. The drug compound identification demonstrates that the drug targets of IMIQUIMOD and raloxifene are the most significant with the significant hub DEGs.",-1
The antidepressant potential of lactobacillus casei in the postpartum depression rat model mediated by the microbiota-gut-brain axis,"Lactobacillus casei, a kind of probiotic, was reported as antidepressant effects. However, little is known about the effect of Lactobacillus casei on postpartum depression (PPD). In this study, we investigated the effects of Lactobacillus casei in improving PPD and potential mechanisms. Four hours of daily maternal separation from postnatal day 2 to day 21 was performed to establish the PPD model in rats. From postnatal day 2 to day 28, rats were gavage-fed with an equal volume of normal saline, Lactobacillus casei (8 Ã 108 CFU/kg/day), or paroxetine (1.8 mg/kg/day), respectively. Rat behaviors were measured using the sucrose preference test, the elevated plus maze, the forced swim test, and the tail suspension test. Changes in gut microbiota were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. Administration of Lactobacillus casei improved depressive-like behaviors, intestinal microflora, and oxidative stress in PPD model rats. Western Blot or HPLC assays showed that Lactobacillus casei intervention reversed the changes of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 1 (NR1), ERK1/2, and monoamines in the brain of PPD rats. These results suggest that Lactobacillus casei could improve PPD through altering gut microbiota composition, brain monoamines and oxidative stress, which may be associated with the regulation of the BDNF-ERK1/2 pathway.",-1
Toward a Better Understanding of the Reciprocal Relations Between Adolescent Psychological Need Experiences and Sleep,"In two diary studies, we examined the reciprocal daily association between the satisfaction and frustration of adolescents' basic psychological needs and sleep, and the role of stress and fatigue in these associations. In Study 1 (N = 211; 52% female; Mage = 15.86 years, SD = 1.18 years), daily need experiences were unrelated to daily fluctuations in subjective sleep outcomes. However, shorter daily sleep quantity was related to higher daily fatigue, which in turn related to more daily need frustration and less need satisfaction. Study 2 (N = 51; 49% female; Mage = 15.88 years, SD = 2.88 years) extended these findings by demonstrating that daily need frustration related to shorter objective sleep quantity and longer wake after sleep onset, indirectly through higher symptoms of stress. Poor sleep quality also related to worse need experiences via higher daily fatigue. These findings underscore the dynamic interplay between daily need experiences and adolescent sleep.",-1
The Soul of Technology,"On the occasion of the award of the author's da Vinci Medal in 2020, this article looks back to the early twentieth-century origins of the history of technology. Spotlighted are three pioneering historians, Sigfried Giedion, Abbott Payson Usher, and Lewis Mumford, whose writings were important to society and the author's intellectual journey. Their histories, written in the wake of World War I and the Second Industrial Revolution, addressed a question as urgent today as in their time: will the human spirit survive the age of machines? Their shared quest to save the soul of technology took them into the world of machines but also cosmic realms. Their solutions are arguably just as important today, as we confront the challenges of artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and other digital technologies. Should the current generation of historians of technology be similarly committed to applying the lessons of history to modern technogenic problems?",-1
Nutraceutic Potential of Bioactive Compounds of Eugenia dysenterica DC in Metabolic Alterations,"The fruit and leaves of Eugenia dysenterica DC., locally known as cagaita, are rich in antioxidant glycosylated quercetin derivatives and phenolic compounds that have beneficial effects on diabetes mellitus, hypertension and general inflammation. We conducted a literature search to investigate the nutraceutical potentials of these phenolic compounds for treating obesity, diabetes mellitus and intestinal inflammatory disease. The phenolic compounds in E. dysenterica have demonstrated effects on carbohydrate metabolism, which can prevent the development of these chronic diseases and reduce LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and hypertension. E. dysenterica also improves intestinal motility and microbiota and protects gastric mucosa, thereby preventing inflammation. However, studies are necessary to identify the mechanism by which E. dysenterica nutraceutical compounds act on such pathological processes to support future research.",-1
Mosquito Control Based on Pesticides and Endosymbiotic Bacterium Wolbachia,"Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever and Zika, have posed a serious threat to human health around the world. Controlling vector mosquitoes is an effective method to prevent these diseases. Spraying pesticides has been the main approach of reducing mosquito population, but it is not a sustainable solution due to the growing insecticide resistance. One promising complementary method is the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into wild mosquito populations, which has been proven to be a novel and environment-friendly way for mosquito control. In this paper, we incorporate consideration of releasing infected sterile mosquitoes and spraying pesticides to aim to reduce wild mosquito populations based on the population replacement model. We present the estimations for the number of wild mosquitoes or infection density in a normal environment and then discuss how to offset the effect of the heatwave, which can cause infected mosquitoes to lose Wolbachia infection. Finally, we give the waiting time to suppress wild mosquito population to a given threshold size by numerical simulations.",-1
"COVID-19 in Elderly, Immunocompromised or Diabetic Patients-From Immune Monitoring to Clinical Management in the Hospital","The novel, highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a pandemic of acute respiratory illness worldwide and remains a huge threat to the healthcare system's capacity to respond to COVID-19. Elderly and immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for a severe course of COVID-19. These high-risk groups have been identified as developing diminished humoral and cellular immune responses. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remains detectable in nasopharyngeal swabs of these patients for a prolonged period of time. These factors complicate the clinical management of these vulnerable patient groups. To date, there are no well-defined guidelines for an appropriate duration of isolation for elderly and immunocompromised patients, especially in hospitals or nursing homes. The aim of the present study was to characterize at-risk patient cohorts capable of producing a replication-competent virus over an extended period after symptomatic COVID-19, and to investigate the humoral and cellular immune responses and infectivity to provide a better basis for future clinical management. In our cohort, the rate of positive viral cultures and the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests correlated with higher viral loads. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes mellitus had adequate cellular and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while immunocompromised patients had reduced humoral and cellular immune responses. Our patient cohort was hospitalized for longer compared with previously published cohorts. Longer hospitalization was associated with a high number of nosocomial infections, representing a potential hazard for additional complications to patients. Most importantly, regardless of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, no virus was culturable beyond a cycle threshold (ct) value of 33 in the majority of samples. Our data clearly indicate that elderly and diabetic patients develop a robust immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and may be safely de-isolated at a ct value of more than 35.",-1
"Influences of Age, Gender, and Body Mass Index on the Thickness of the Abdominal Fatty Layers and its Relevance for Abdominal Liposuction and Abdominoplasty","Background:                    Liposuction and lipoabdominoplasty procedures frequently involve the treatment of the superficial and deep fatty layers of the abdomen.              Objectives:                    The aim of the present investigation was to provide comprehensive data on the thickness of the abdominal fatty layers in relation to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI).              Methods:                    The study investigated 150 Caucasian individuals; there was an equal distribution of males and females (each n = 75) and a balanced distribution of age (n = 30 per decade: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 years) and BMI (n = 50 per group: BMI â?4.9, 25.0-29.9, and â?0 kg/m2). Ultrasound-based measurements of the superficial and deep abdominal fatty layers were performed.              Results:                    An increase in BMI was associated with an increase in total abdominal wall fat thickness. The measured increase was related more to the thickness of the deep fatty layer than to the thickness of the superficial fatty layer (Z = 1.80, P = 0.036). An increase in age was associated with a decrease in thickness of the superficial fatty layer (rp = -0.104, P = 0.071) but with an increase in thickness of the deep fatty layer (rp = 0.197, P = 0.001).              Conclusions:                    Age and BMI can change the thickness of both the superficial and deep fatty layers of the anterior abdominal wall, thus influencing the plan and conduct of cosmetic surgical procedures. Knowledge of the layered anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall, as well as its associated blood supply, is important for surgeons performing procedures in this area.",-1
A T-rich nucleic acid-enhanced electrochemical platform based on electroactive silver nanoclusters for miRNA detection,"DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs) serve as a useful electrochemical sensing nanomaterial characterized by excellent electroactivity and good stability, while the effect of surrounding nucleotides on their electroactivity has not been studied. Herein, we validated a nucleotide-assisted enhancement mechanism of the DNA/AgNCs electroactivity caused by T-rich nucleic acid sequences in the vicinity of AgNCs. Based on the T-rich nucleic acid-enhanced AgNCs (NAE-AgNCs) combined with hybrid chain reaction (HCR), a novel signal-enhanced electrochemical biosensing platform was established for the ultrasensitive detection of miRNA. In the presence of target miRNA-155, HCR could be triggered to generate duplex strands containing both numerous AgNC synthesis sites and T-rich overhang strands upon the electrode. With the electrodeposition of adjacent AgNCs on the electrode, the larger oxidation potential of T-rich nucleic acid leaded to stronger electron-accepting capacity, which could contribute to increased current responses. The T-rich NAE HCR electrochemical strategy resulted in a detection limit of 0.39 fM for miRNA-155 detection, one order of magnitude lower than conventional HCR-based electrochemical sensors. This T-rich nucleic acid-assisted enhancement mechanism provided a new direction to construct highly sensitive, label-free, low-cost, and simple sensing platforms for applications in biomarker assays and clinic diagnosis.",-1
"Effects of ALT-801, a GLP-1 and glucagon receptor dual agonist, in a translational mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis","Body weight loss of â?10% improves the metabolic derangements and liver disease in the majority of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients, suggesting metabolic modulators may be effective in controlling disease. The pharmacodynamics of ALT-801, a GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist optimized for NASH and weight loss, were compared to semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and elafibranor (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, PPAR-Î±/Î´, agonist) in a biopsy-confirmed, diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model of NASH (DIO-NASH). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed Amylin Liver NASH (AMLN) diet for 32 weeks. Animals with biopsy-confirmed steatosis and fibrosis received ALT-801, semaglutide, elafibranor, or vehicle daily for 12 weeks while maintained on the AMLN diet. Study endpoints included body and liver weight, liver and plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides, plasma aminotransferases, histological analysis of liver steatosis, inflammation (galectin-3) and fibrosis (collagen type 1 alpha 1), and evaluation of individual animal changes in composite Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score (NAS), and fibrosis stage. ALT-801 demonstrated significant reductions in body weight (approx. 25%), plasma aminotransferases, plasma total cholesterol and liver triglycerides/total cholesterol in conjunction with improved liver steatosis, with greater reductions (p < 0.05) compared to semaglutide and elafibranor. ALT-801 significantly reduced the inflammation marker galectin-3 and the fibrosis marker collagen type 1 alpha 1 vs. vehicle (p < 0.05), with ALT-801 producing greater reductions in galectin-3 vs. elafibranor (p < 0.05). Importantly, all animals treated with ALT-801 significantly improved composite NAS compared to the active controls. This study provides evidence for a potential role for ALT-801 in the therapeutic treatment of NASH.",-1
Study of the sterile insect release technique for a two-sex mosquito population model,"In this paper, to study the large-scale time control and limited-time control of mosquito population in a field, a two-sex mosquito population model with stage structure and impulsive releases of sterile males is proposed. For the large-scale time control, a wild mosquito-free periodic solution is given and conditions under which it is globally stable are obtained by the use of the monotone system theory. Besides, based on the stability analysis, threshold conditions under which the wild mosquito population is eliminated or not are obtained. Then we study three different optimal release strategies for the limited-time control, which takes into account both of the population control level of wild mosquitoes and the economic input. To solve technical problems in optimal impulsive control, a time rescaling technique is applied and the gradients of cost function with respect to all control parameters are obtained. In addition, by the aid of numerical simulation, we get the optimal release amounts and release timings for each release strategy. Our study indicates that the optimal release timing control is superior to the optimal release amount control. However, simultaneous optimal selection of release amount and release timing leads to the best control performance.",-1
"Extracellular Vesicles, New Players in Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","Sepsis refers to a complex syndrome associated with physiological, pathological, and biochemical abnormalities resulted from infection. Sepsis is the major cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are serving as new messengers to mediate cell-cell communication in vivo. Non-coding RNAs, proteins and metabolites encapsulated by EVs could result in either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects in the recipient cells. Pathogens or host cells derived EVs play an important role in pathogens infection during the occurrence and development of sepsis and ARDS. Additionally, we summarize the potential application for EVs in diagnosis, prevention and treatment for sepsis and ARDS.",-1
The molecular characteristics in different procedures of spermatogenesis,"Spermatogenesis is a multistep biological process. In addition to somatic cells, it involves the orderly differentiation of dozens of spermatogenic cells. In this process, the regulatory networks between different spermatogenic cell populations are significantly different. RNA m6A regulators and miRNAs have been found to be closely related to spermatogenesis in recent years, and they are an important part of the above regulatory networks. Understanding gene expression and its rules in different spermatogenic cell populations will help in the in-depth exploration of their detailed roles in spermatogenesis. This study collected a public dataset of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). Based on the Johnson score, the testicular samples of NOA were divided into three types, Sertoli-cell only syndrome, meiotic arrest and postmeiotic arrest, which represented the loss of three germ cell populations, including whole spermatogenic cells, postmeiotic spermatogenic cells, and a mixture of late spermatids and spermatozoa, respectively. The aforementioned three types of testis data were compared with normal testis data, and the molecular expression characteristics of the abovementioned three germ cell populations were obtained. Our study showed that different germ cell populations have different active molecules and their pathways. In addition, RNA m6A regulators, including METTL3, IGF2BP2 and PRRC2A, and miRNAs, including hsa-let-7a-2, hsa-let-7f-1, hsa-let-7g, hsa-miR-15a, hsa-miR-197, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-30e, hsa-miR-32, hsa-miR-503 and hsa-miR-99a, also presented regulatory roles in almost all germ cells.",-1
Different Effects of RNAi-Mediated Downregulation or Chemical Inhibition of NAMPT in an Isogenic IDH Mutant and Wild-Type Glioma Cell Model,"The IDH1R132H mutation in glioma results in the neoenzymatic function of IDH1, leading to the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), alterations in energy metabolism and changes in the cellular redox household. Although shifts in the redox ratio NADPH/NADP+ were described, the consequences for the NAD+ synthesis pathways and potential therapeutic interventions were largely unexplored. Here, we describe the effects of heterozygous IDH1R132H on the redox system in a CRISPR/Cas edited glioblastoma model and compare them with IDH1 wild-type (IDH1wt) cells. Besides an increase in 2-HG and decrease in NADPH, we observed an increase in NAD+ in IDH1R132H glioblastoma cells. RT-qPCR analysis revealed the upregulation of the expression of the NAD+ synthesis enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Knockdown of NAMPT resulted in significantly reduced viability in IDH1R132H glioblastoma cells. Given this dependence of IDH1R132H cells on NAMPT expression, we explored the effects of the NAMPT inhibitors FK866, GMX1778 and GNE-617. Surprisingly, these agents were equally cytotoxic to IDH1R132H and IDH1wt cells. Altogether, our results indicate that targeting the NAD+ synthesis pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy in IDH mutant gliomas; however, the agent should be carefully considered since three small-molecule inhibitors of NAMPT tested in this study were not suitable for this purpose.",-1
Abdominal Etching: Surgical Technique and Outcomes,"Background:                    The ideal body is characterized by a muscular physique and defined anterior abdominal wall. Despite diet and exercise, many are unable to achieve this desired result. Liposuction with abdominal etching is used to achieve high-definition abdominal aesthetics. The etching technique is performed with liposuction in a superficial plane, to create indentures consistent with ""six-pack abs,"" or definition of vertical abdominal lines.              Methods:                    The authors' abdominal etching preoperative markings, surgical technique, and postoperative care are discussed. The surgeons' experience with abdominal etching in 50 consecutive patients is reviewed, including rate of complications and patient satisfaction.              Results:                    The average patient age was 36.4 years. We had an almost equal number of men (n = 26) and women (n = 24), with an average body mass index of 26.7 kg/m. The average blood loss was 275 ml, the average tumescence was 6 liters, and the average lipoaspirate was 5 liters. There were no major complications such as fat embolus, deep venous thrombosis, or intraabdominal injury. The most common minor postoperative complications were contour irregularities (12 percent), seromas (10 percent), and hyperpigmentation (2 percent). The majority of patients were satisfied (98 percent). The average length of postoperative follow-up was 27 months.              Conclusions:                    Abdominal etching is a safe and effective method of creating a defined anterior abdominal wall for patients who desire the muscular definition of vertical abdominal lines. Almost all of our patients reviewed were satisfied with this procedure, maintained long-term results, and had an acceptable rate of complications.              Clinical question/level of evidence:                    Therapeutic, IV.",-1
High intensity interval training promotes total and visceral fat mass loss in obese Zucker rats without modulating gut microbiota,"Aims:                    Increased visceral adipose tissue and dysbiosis in the overweight and obese promote chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the gut-adipose tissue cross-talk in obese Zucker rats.              Methods:                    Obese male Zucker rats (n = 36) were divided in three groups: MICT (12m.min-1 for 51min), HIIT (6 sets at 18 m.min-1 for 4min followed by 3min at 10m.min-1) and controls (CONT; no exercise). The animals ran on a treadmill 5 days/week for 10 weeks. Body composition, glycaemic control, lipid profile, inflammation, lipolysis signalling in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, intestinal permeability (tight junctions and plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein; LBP), and gut microbiota composition were assessed in the three groups.              Results:                    After 10 weeks of exercise, total and epididymal fat mass decreased only in the HIIT group. The Î±/Î² adrenergic receptor RNA ratio in subcutaneous adipose tissue increased only in the HIIT group. The expression level of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase was not modified by training. Both HIIT and MICT decreased inflammation (plasma myeloperoxidase and keratinocyte-derived chemokine secretion in adipose tissue) and improved glucose metabolism. Zonula occludens-1 and occludin were upregulated in the HIIT group. Plasma LBP was similarly reduced in both training groups. HIIT and MICT did not affect gut microbiota composition.              Conclusion:                    In obese Zucker rats, HIIT and MICT improved inflammation and glucose metabolism. In contrast, only HIIT decreased total and visceral fat mass. These adaptations were not associated with modifications in gut microbiota composition.",-1
Malaria transmission in landscapes with varying deforestation levels and timelines in the Amazon: a longitudinal spatiotemporal study,"The relationship between deforestation and malaria is a spatiotemporal process of variation in Plasmodium incidence in human-dominated Amazonian rural environments. The present study aimed to assess the underlying mechanisms of malarial exposure risk at a fine scale in 5-km2 sites across the Brazilian Amazon, using field-collected data with a longitudinal spatiotemporally structured approach. Anopheline mosquitoes were sampled from 80 sites to investigate the Plasmodium infection rate in mosquito communities and to estimate the malaria exposure risk in rural landscapes. The remaining amount of forest cover (accumulated deforestation) and the deforestation timeline were estimated in each site to represent the main parameters of both the frontier malaria hypothesis and an alternate scenario, the deforestation-malaria hypothesis, proposed herein. The maximum frequency of pathogenic sites occurred at the intermediate forest cover level (50% of accumulated deforestation) at two temporal deforestation peaks, e.g., 10 and 35 years after the beginning of the organization of a settlement. The incidence density of infected anophelines in sites where the original forest cover decreased by more than 50% in the first 25 years of settlement development was at least twice as high as the incidence density calculated for the other sites studied (adjusted incidence density ratio = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.38-3.68; p = 0.001). The results of this study support the frontier malaria as a unifying hypothesis for explaining malaria emergence and for designing specific control interventions in the Brazilian Amazon.",-1
Transcriptomic signature of fasting in human adipose tissue,"Little is known about gene regulation by fasting in human adipose tissue. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of fasting on adipose tissue gene expression in humans. To that end, subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were collected from 11 volunteers 2 and 26 h after consumption of a standardized meal. For comparison, epididymal adipose tissue was collected from C57Bl/6J mice in the ab libitum-fed state and after a 16 h fast. The timing of sampling adipose tissue roughly corresponds with the near depletion of liver glycogen. Transcriptome analysis was carried out using Affymetrix microarrays. We found that, 1) fasting downregulated numerous metabolic pathways in human adipose tissue, including triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis, glycolysis and glycogen synthesis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial translation, and insulin signaling; 2) fasting downregulated genes involved in proteasomal degradation in human adipose tissue; 3) fasting had much less pronounced effects on the adipose tissue transcriptome in humans than mice; 4) although major overlap in fasting-induced gene regulation was observed between human and mouse adipose tissue, many genes were differentially regulated in the two species, including genes involved in insulin signaling (PRKAG2, PFKFB3), PPAR signaling (PPARG, ACSL1, HMGCS2, SLC22A5, ACOT1), glycogen metabolism (PCK1, PYGB), and lipid droplets (PLIN1, PNPLA2, CIDEA, CIDEC). In conclusion, although numerous genes and pathways are regulated similarly by fasting in human and mouse adipose tissue, many genes show very distinct responses to fasting in humans and mice. Our data provide a useful resource to study adipose tissue function during fasting.",-1
Temperate conditions restrict Japanese encephalitis virus infection to the mid-gut and prevents systemic dissemination in Culex pipiens mosquitoes,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is the main cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. However, with changing climate JEV has the potential to emerge in novel temperate regions. Here, we have assessed the vector competence of the temperate mosquito Culex pipiens f. pipiens to vector JEV genotype III at temperatures representative of those experienced, or predicted in the future during the summer months, in the United Kingdom. Our results show that Cx. pipiens is susceptible to JEV infection at both temperatures. In addition, at 25 Â°C, JEV disseminated from the midgut and was recovered in saliva samples, indicating the potential for transmission. At a lower temperature, 20 Â°C, following an incubation period of fourteen days, there were reduced levels of JEV dissemination and virus was not detected in saliva samples. The virus present in the bodies of these mosquitoes was restricted to the posterior midgut as determined by microscopy and viable virus was successfully recovered. Apart from the influence on virus dissemination, mosquito mortality was significantly increased at the higher temperature. Overall, our results suggest that temperature is a critical factor for JEV vector competence and infected-mosquito survival. This may in turn influence the vectorial capacity of Cx. pipiens to vector JEV genotype III in temperate areas.",-1
G protein-coupled receptor kinase type 2 and Î²-arrestin2: Key players in immune cell functions and inflammation,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase type 2 (GRK2) and Î²-arrestin2 are representative proteins that regulate the transduction and trafficking of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. The kinase GRK2 and the multifunctional scaffolding protein Î²-arrestin2 are key integrated signaling nodes in various biological processes, and both of them regulate cell proliferation and promote cell invasion and migration. GRK2/Î²-arrestin2 play multiple roles in the pathological mechanisms of a wide range of diseases including heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. This review summarizes the roles of GRK2/Î²-arrestin2 in immune cell function and focuses on the pathological implications of GRK2/Î²-arrestin2 in various inflammatory diseases.",-1
Cross-talk between fetal membranes and visceral adipose tissue involves HMGB1-RAGE and VIP-VPAC2 pathways in human gestational diabetes mellitus,"Aims:                    Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance that is first diagnosed during pregnancy. Maternal adipose tissue and fetal membranes secrete various molecules that are relevant players in the pathogenesis of GDM. This pilot study aimed to examine whether the expression of the high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and its receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and its receptors (VPAC-1,-2) were modified in pregnant women with GDM.              Methods:                    Fetal membranes (FMs), omental adipose tissue (VAT) explants, and serum samples were obtained from 12 women with GDM and 12 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at delivery. The expression of HMGB1, RAGE and VIP, VPAC-1,-2 was detected by Western Blotting in explants; circulating levels and ""in vitro"" release of HMGB1 and VIP were measured by ELISA tests.              Results:                    HMGB1 tissue expression was higher in FMs obtained from GDM women (p = 0.02) than in FMs from NGT women. VPAC2 (p = 0.03) and RAGE (p = 0.03) tissue expressions were significantly increased in VAT from GDM subjects. Only FMs of NGT released detectable levels of HMGB1, which was not observed in samples obtained from GDM. VAT of GDM released lower levels of VIP (p = 0.05) than NGT samples.              Conclusions:                    This study indicates that a fine tuned regulation exists between FMs and VAT throughout pregnancy to maintain immune metabolic homeostasis. In GDM a balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators has been observed. Further studies are needed to establish their exact role on fetal and maternal outcomes in GDM.",-1
Preexposure to heat stress attenuates sepsis-associated inflammation and cognitive decline in rats,"Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to an infection, leading to cognitive impairments. Studies have shown that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) exhibited a neuroprotective effect. In this study we used mild heat stress to induce expression of HSP70, aiming to detect the effect of HSP70 on neurocognitive deficits associated with sepsis and explored the underlying mechanisms. Male rats were exposed to 42â?for 15 min. After 12 h, they were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). HSP70 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, and nuclear level of NF-ÎºB p65 were detected by western blot. Levels of inflammatory cytokines in circulation and hippocampus were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR. Neuronal morphology and damage of hippocampal neurons were assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Nissl stainings. Microglial activation was determined by immunohistochemistry. Finally, neurologic and cognitive functions were evaluated using neurobehavioral scoring and morris water maze (MWM) test. Mild heat stress increased survival rate of sepsis rats. Mild heat stress upregulated HSP70, inhibited nuclear level of NF-ÎºB p65 in hippocampus. Mild heat stress could diminish IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± levels in circulation and hippocampus. Furthermore, mild heat stress was able to enhance expression of BDNF and alleviate cognitive impairment after sepsis. Overall, these results indicated that mild heat stress showed protective effects on sepsis-associated encephalopathy rat model, which may be associated with upregulation of HSP70 and inhibition of NF-ÎºB pathway.",-1
Optimal delivery time for patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus: a single-center real-world study,"Background:                    To determine the optimal delivery time for women with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus by comparing differences in adverse maternal-fetal outcome and cesarean section rates.              Methods:                    This real-world retrospective study included 1,050 patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus who delivered at 35-42 weeks' gestation. Data on patient characteristics, maternal-fetal outcomes, and cesarean section rate based on fetal gestational age were collected and analyzed. Differences between deliveries with and without iatrogenic intervention were also analyzed.              Results:                    The cesarean section rate at â?41 weeks' gestation was significantly higher than that at 39-39 + 6 weeks (56% vs. 39%, p = 0.031). There were no significant differences in multiple adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes at delivery before and after 39 weeks. Vaginal delivery rates were increased significantly at 39-39 + 6 weeks due to iatrogenic intervention (p = 0.005) and 40-40 + 6 weeks (p = 0.003) in patients without and with spontaneous uterine contractions, respectively.              Conclusions:                    It's recommended that optimal delivery time for patients with diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus should be between 39- and 40 + 6 weeks' gestation. Patients who have Bishop scores higher than 4 can undergo iatrogenic intervention at 39-39 + 6 weeks. However iatrogenic interventions are not recommended for patients with low Bishop scores.",-1
Increased PD-L1 Expression in Acquired Cisplatin-Resistant Lung Cancer Cells via Mir-181a,"Cancer immunotherapy has dramatically improved the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In tumor cells, programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274), is a key target for cancer immunotherapy. Cisplatin (CDDP), a first-class NSCLC treatment drug, reportedly induces PD-L1 expression, and regulates cancer immunity. Herein, the regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 was investigated in CDDP-treated NSCLC and acquired CDDP-resistant NSCLC. Two types of NSCLC cell lines, A549 and H69, and their CDDP-resistant cell lines, A549R and H68R, were used to investigate PD-L1 expression and microRNA mir-181a expression. Murine lung cancer LL/2 cells were injected to mice for in vivo study. Although CDDP induced PD-L1 expression in A549 and H69 cells, A549R and H69R cells expressed extremely higher levels of PD-L1. CDDP-induced mir-181a was detected in A549 and H69 cells, but not A549R and H69R cells. Moreover, the CDDP-induced ATM-mir-181a-c-FOS pathway repressed PD-L1 expression in A549 cells, while A549R cells blocked this negative regulatory mechanism to further increase PD-L1 expression. Exogenous mir-181a in LL/2 cells could repress the intratumoral exhausted T cells, and increase the T cells function, and repress the tumor growth. Increased PD-L1 expression in acquired cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells is dependent on mir-181a in NSCLC.",-1

Diets Containing Egg or Whey Protein and Inulin Fiber Improve Energy Balance and Modulate Gut Microbiota in Exercising Obese Rats,"Scope:                    Dietary protein, prebiotic fiber, and exercise individually have been shown to aid in weight loss; however less is known of their combined effects on energy balance. The effects of diets high in protein and fiber, with exercise, on energy balance, hormones, and gut microbiota, were determined.              Methods and results:                    Obese male rats were fed high-fat diets with high protein and fiber contents from egg protein and cellulose, egg protein and inulin, whey protein and cellulose, or whey protein and inulin, together with treadmill exercise. We found that inulin enriched diets decreased energy intake and respiratory quotient (RQ), increased energy expenditure (EE), and upregulated transcripts for cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY, and proglucagon in distal gut. Notably, CCK1-receptor blockade attenuated the hypophagic effects of diets and in particular whey-inulin diet, and Î²-adrenergic blockade reduced EE across all diets. Egg-cellulose, egg-inulin, and whey-inulin diets decreased weight gain, adiposity, and hepatic lipidosis; decreased lipogenic transcripts, improved glycemic control, and upregulated hepatic glucose metabolism transcripts; and decreased plasma insulin and leptin. Importantly, diet was linked to altered gut microbial composition and plasma metabolomics, and a subset of predicted metagenome pathways and plasma metabolites significantly correlated, with plasma butyric acid the most strongly associated to metagenome function.              Conclusion:                    Combination of dietary egg or whey protein with inulin and exercise improved energy balance, glucose metabolism, upregulated anorectic hormones, and selectively modulated gut microbiota and plasma metabolites.",-1
Synergistic Interactions between Tocol and Phenolic Extracts from Different Tree Nut Species against Human Cancer Cell Lines,"Tree nuts are rich in polar (phenolic compounds) and non-polar (tocols) antioxidants, with recognized effects in the prevention of diseases such as cancer. These biomolecules possess antiproliferative activity on cancer cells; however, the combined effect of both types of compounds has been scarcely studied, and this approach could give valuable information on the real anticancer potential of tree nuts. In the present study, the antiproliferative activity of pure tocols and phenolic compounds, tocol- and phenolic-rich extracts (TRE and PRE, respectively) from tree nuts and the extracts combinations, was evaluated in four cancer (HeLa, MCF7, PC3, A549) and one control (ARPE) cell lines. The most sensible cell lines were HeLa and MCF7. TRE and PRE from nuts were chemically characterized; Î³ and Î´ tocopherols, total tocols, total tocopherols and total phenolic compounds were negatively correlated with cell viability in MCF7 cells. In HeLa cells, only Î´ and total tocopherols were negatively correlated with cell viability. TRE and PRE had a low effect in reducing cell viability of the cancer cell lines, the most effective extracts were those of emory oak acorn (EOA), pecan nut (PEC) and walnut (WAL), and these were further studied for their pharmacological interactions, using the combination index and the isobologram methods. Combinations of both extracts showed a synergistic and strongly synergistic behavior in the three nuts (EOA, PEC and WAL), with combination indexes between 0.12 and 0.55. These results highlight the need to understand the interactions among components found in complex natural extracts or food products in order to fully understand their bioactivities.",-1
Analysis of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Polyomaviruses (HPyVs) in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC) of the Head and Neck Region Reveals Three HPV-Positive Cases with Adenoid Cystic-like Features,"An aetiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) and/or human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) has been proposed in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). Moreover, HPV-related multiphenotypic carcinoma (HMSC) was recently introduced as an emerging entity of the sinonasal region. Here, we primarily want to study the role of HPV/HPyV in a large AdCC cohort and, secondly, possibly identify and characterize HMSC. Tumour DNA from 68 patients initially diagnosed with AdCC between 2000 and 2012 was, therefore, tested for 27 HPV types and 10 HPyVs. HPV DNA-positive samples were micromorphologically re-evaluated, further stained for p16INK4a, S100, p63 and CD117 and tested for the presence of the MYB-NFIB fusion transcript. Notably, no samples were HPyV-positive, while one sinonasal and two tonsillar carcinomas were HPV- and p16-positive. After re-evaluating the micromorphology, immunohistochemistry and presence of fusion transcripts, all tumours had the same appearance and fitted within the diagnosis of HMSC, but in all these three cases, the morphology of the HMSC and basaloid squamous cell carcinoma was overlapping. We conclude that HPV and HPyV have no major role in AdCC. However, based on our data, we also suggest that HMSC should be considered as a basaloid variant of squamous cell carcinoma, and not its own entity, until better characterized.",-1
Recognition of Immune Cell Markers of COVID-19 Severity with Machine Learning Methods,"COVID-19 is hypothesized to be linked to the host's excessive inflammatory immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is regarded to be a major factor in disease severity and mortality. Numerous immune cells play a key role in immune response regulation, and gene expression analysis in these cells could be a useful method for studying disease states, assessing immunological responses, and detecting biomarkers. Here, we developed a machine learning procedure to find biomarkers that discriminate disease severity in individual immune cells (B cell, CD4+ cell, CD8+ cell, monocyte, and NK cell) using single-cell gene expression profiles of COVID-19. The gene features of each profile were first filtered and ranked using the Boruta feature selection method and mRMR, and the resulting ranked feature lists were then fed into the incremental feature selection method to determine the optimal number of features with decision tree and random forest algorithms. Meanwhile, we extracted the classification rules in each cell type from the optimal decision tree classifiers. The best gene sets discovered in this study were analyzed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, and some important biomarkers like TLR2, ITK, CX3CR1, IL1B, and PRDM1 were validated by recent literature. The findings reveal that the optimal gene sets for each cell type can accurately classify COVID-19 disease severity and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in disease progression.",-1
"[Recommendations for the support of suffering, severely ill, dying or grieving persons in the corona pandemic from a palliative care perspective : Recommendations of the German Society for Palliative Medicine (DGP), the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), the Federal Association for Grief Counseling (BVT), the Working Group for Psycho-oncology in the German Cancer Society, the German Association for Social Work in the Healthcare System (DVSG) and the German Association for Systemic Therapy, Counseling and Family Therapy (DGSF)]","The corona pandemic has led to a number of restrictions and prohibitions, which in turn place large psychosocial or spiritual burdens on patients with COVID-19, their families and relatives and the treating personnel in the healthcare system. Patients with COVID-19 are not allowed to receive visitors and many hospitals and nursing homes have completely banned visitors. Many support services have been reduced or stopped completely. Necessary treatment interventions for other patients with critical and life-limiting diseases have been delayed or suspended in order to free resources for the expected COVID-19 patients; however, these people need to feel social connectedness with their relatives. Palliative care patients should be exempted from any ban on visitors. Families should be able to visit dying patients even on intensive care units or isolation wards, using adequate protective equipment. Alternative options, such as video telephone calls or via social media should be explored for patients in isolation. Families should also be enabled to say goodbye to the deceased with adequate protective equipment or should be offered alternative real or virtual options for remembrance and commemoration. Health care professionals coping with the exceptional stress should be continuously supported. This requires clear communication and leadership structures, communication training, psychosocial support, but most of all optimal framework conditions for the clinical work.",-1
EASIX and Severe Endothelial Complications After CD19-Directed CAR-T Cell Therapy-A Cohort Study,"Background:                    Endothelial dysfunction is associated with two main complications of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). This study evaluates the Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) as a prognostic marker for high-grade CRS and ICANS in patients treated with CD19-directed CAR-T cells.              Methods:                    In this retrospective study, a training cohort of 93 patients from the ZUMA-1 trial and a validation cohort of 121 patients from two independent centers (University Hospital Heidelberg, CharitÃ© University Medicine Berlin) were investigated. The primary objective was to assess the predictive capacity of EASIX measured immediately before the start of lymphodepletion (EASIX-pre) for the occurrence of grade â? CRS and/or ICANS. To explore a possible endothelial link, serum levels of endothelial stress markers (angiopoietin-2, suppressor of tumorigenicity-2, soluble thrombomodulin, and interleukin-8) were determined before lymphodepletion and on day 7 after CART infusion in the validation cohort (n = 47).              Results:                    The prognostic effect of EASIX-pre on grade â? CRS and/or ICANS was significant in the training cohort [OR 2-fold increase 1.72 (1.26-2.46)] and validated in the independent cohort. An EASIX-pre cutoff >4.67 derived from the training cohort associated with a 4.3-fold increased odds ratio of severe CRS/ICANS in the independent cohort. Serum endothelial distress markers measured on day+7 correlated with EASIX-pre and associated with severe complications.              Conclusions:                    EASIX-pre is a powerful predictor of severe CRS/ICANS after CD19-directed CART therapy and might be used as a basis for risk-adapted prevention strategies.",-1
Interleukin-1Î² and prostaglandin-synthesizing enzymes as modulators of human omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue function,"IL-1Î² stimulates expression of prostaglandin (PG)-synthesizing enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and aldo-keto reductase (AKR)1B1 in human preadipocytes. We aimed to examine the impact of IL-1Î², COX-2 and AKR1B1 on markers of human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue function, and to assess whether PG synthesis by these enzymes mediates IL-1Î² effects. Omental and subcutaneous fat samples were obtained from bariatric surgery patients. PG release and expression of inflammatory and adipogenic markers were assessed in explants treated with COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or AKR1B1 inhibitor Statil, with or without IL-1Î². Preadipocyte differentiation experiments were also performed. IL-1Î² decreased expression of PPARÎ³ in both fat depots compared to control and increased expression of NF-ÎºB1, IL-6, CCL-5, ICAM-1 and VEGFA, especially in visceral fat for IL-6, CCL-5 and VEGFA. Adding Statil or NS-398 to IL-1Î² blunted PGF2Î± and PGE2 release, but did not alter IL-1Î² effects on adipose tissue function markers. IL-1Î² down-regulated adipocyte differentiation whereas NS-398 alone increased this process. However, NS-398 did not prevent IL-1Î² inhibition of adipogenesis. We conclude that IL-1Î² induces a pro-inflammatory response in human adipose tissues, particularly in visceral fat, and acts independently of concomitant PG release. IL-1Î² and COX-2 appear to be critical determinants of adipose tissue pathophysiologic remodeling in obesity.",-1
Circ_0011292 knockdown mitigates progression and drug resistance in PTX-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer cells by regulating miR-433-3p/CHEK1 axis,"Background:                    Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common malignant tumors on earth. Circular RNAs have been disclosed to be vital regulators in the chemoresistance and development of diverse cancers, including NSCLC. Here, we attempted to explore the function of circ_0011292 in paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant NSCLC cells.              Methods:                    Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot was performed to detect the expression of circ_0011292, microRNA-433-3p (miR-433-3p), and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1). Ribonuclease R (RNase R) assay was performed to assess the stability of circ_0011292. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was conducted to evaluate the half maximal inhibitory concentration of PTX and cell viability. Cell proliferation was monitored by Edu incorporation and colony formation assays. Cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Transwell assay was implemented to assess cell migration and invasion. Western blot assay was utilized to determine the protein levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was carried out to verify the targeted interaction between miR-433-3p and circ_0011292 or CHEK1. Xenograft tumor model was constructed for determining the effect of circ_0011292 in NSCLC growth in vivo.              Results:                    Circ_0011292 was upregulated in PTX-resistant NSCLC tissues and cells. Circ_0011292 or CHEK1 knockdown enhanced PTX sensitivity and cell apoptosis, and repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PTX-resistant NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, circ_0011292 was a sponge of miR-433-3p and miR-433-3p directly targeted CHEK1. Meanwhile, silencing miR-433-3p or overexpressing CHEK1 respectively abrogated the impacts of circ_0011292 deletion or miR-433-3p introduction on PTX resistance and cell progression in PTX-resistant NSCLC cells in vitro. Moreover, circ_0011292 could positively modulate CHEK1 expression through sponging miR-433-3p. In addition, circ_0011292 knockdown retarded tumor growth of NSCLC in vivo.              Conclusion:                    Circ_0011292 could accelerate PTX resistance and cell malignant progression of NSCLC cells partially through the regulation of circ_0011292/miR-433-3p/CHEK1 axis.",-1
English Teaching Quality Monitoring and Multidimensional Analysis Based on the Internet of Things and Deep Learning Model,"With the development of the times, English as the universal language in the world has been highly valued by the society and schools, and English skills have become a basic skill in the society. The school is actively developing, and in the process of reform and development, the monitoring of teaching quality is essential. Teaching quality is a complex and vague concept. The establishment of a teaching quality monitoring system helps to ensure the quality of personnel training and improve the level of education and teaching, and the quality of classroom teaching is the core content of education quality. Teaching quality monitoring is the management process of various measures and actions taken to ensure the continuous improvement of students' learning quality and to achieve certain quality standards by systematically supervising and controlling various factors affecting the teaching quality in the teaching process. The research results of the article show that (1) under the traditional teaching mode, the average grades of the three groups were 74, 72, 67, 62, and 62, respectively. The score of the oral test module is relatively low, the highest score is only 63 points, the overall score shows a low level, the academic achievement is hovering on the edge of passing, and the students' English learning situation is poor. Under the new classroom quality monitoring mode, the average scores of the three groups were 96, 92, 90, 86, and 84, respectively. Compared with the ordinary teaching mode, the scores of the five detection modules were greatly improved, and the average score of the listening module was improved. The teaching contents include 22 listening modules, 20 reading modules, 23 cloze modules, 24 translation modules, and 22 speaking modules. Overall, students' English learning level has been greatly improved. (2) Generally speaking, the overall reliability coefficient of the sample data with full English teaching content is mostly kept in the range of 0.70-0.95, and only a few parts show a low situation, which also shows the overall situation of the diversity of teaching content. The overall reliability coefficient of the sample data of good teaching methods shows a relatively high situation, the reliability coefficient of the improvement of learning interest can reach 0.93, the reliability coefficient of the understanding of the learning content can reach the highest 0.96, the problem analysis ability can reach the highest 0.97, and the innovation ability can reach 0.96. The improved reliability coefficient can reach up to 0.98, which shows the authenticity and validity of the experimental data. (3) The detection result of the new classroom quality monitoring teaching mode is the highest among several models, the accuracy rate can reach 96.42%, the recall rate can reach 97.21%, and the F1 value can reach 97.46%, indicating that the new classroom quality monitoring teaching mode is effective. Teaching performance is the highest. According to the ROC curve values of the four models, we can also conclude that the ROC value of the new classroom quality monitoring teaching has been maintained at 0.98 without major twists and turns. Whether it is in the test set or the training set, the detection results of the new classroom quality monitoring are still the highest, the accuracy rate can reach 94.42%, the recall rate can reach 94.78%, and the F1 value can reach 94.49%. After the training set runs, except the performance of the traditional teaching mode increases, the performance of the other 3 models decreases.",-1
Hypertuned Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Sign Language Recognition,"Sign language plays a pivotal role in the lives of impaired people having speaking and hearing disabilities. They can convey messages using hand gesture movements. American Sign Language (ASL) recognition is challenging due to the increasing intra-class similarity and high complexity. This paper used a deep convolutional neural network for ASL alphabet recognition to overcome ASL recognition challenges. This paper presents an ASL recognition approach using a deep convolutional neural network. The performance of the DeepCNN model improves with the amount of given data; for this purpose, we applied the data augmentation technique to expand the size of training data from existing data artificially. According to the experiments, the proposed DeepCNN model provides consistent results for the ASL dataset. Experiments prove that the DeepCNN gives a better accuracy gain of 19.84%, 8.37%, 16.31%, 17.17%, 5.86%, and 3.26% as compared to various state-of-the-art approaches.",-1
Gut microbiota and butyrate contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in premenopause due to estrogen deficiency,"The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in postmenopausal women has increased significantly. Estrogen plays a very important role in NAFLD, but whether NAFLD in premenopausal women was caused by estrogen deficiency was unknown. Thus, it is of great clinical significance to explore the mechanism of NAFLD in premenopausal women. Gut microbiota and its metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFA) have been shown to play important roles in the development of NAFLD. In this study, we investigated the impact of gut microbiota and SCFA in NAFLD patients and mice caused by estrogen deficiency. We showed that premenopause NAFLD patients had much lower estrogen levels. Estrogen deficient mice, due to ovariectomy (OVX), suffered more severe liver steatosis with an elevated body weight, abdominal fat weight, serum triglycerides and deterioration in hepatic steatosis. Altered gut microbiota composition and decreased butyrate content were found in NAFLD patients and in OVX mice. Furthermore, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or supplementing with butyrate alleviated NAFLD in OVX mice. The production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) Reg3É£, Î²-defensins and the expression of intestinal epithelial tight junction, including ZO-1 and Occluding-5, were decreased in the OVX mice compared to control mice. Upregulation of PPAR-É£ and VLDLR, downregulation of PPAR-É indicated that OVX mice suffered from abnormal lipid metabolism. These data indicate that changes in the gut microbiota and SCFA caused by estrogen reduction, together with a disorder in AMP production and lipid metabolism, promote NAFLD, thus provide SCFAs derived from microbiota as new therapeutic targets for the clinical prevention and treatment of NAFLD.",-1
Melatonin Inhibits OGD/R-Induced H9c2 Cardiomyocyte Pyroptosis via Regulation of MT2/miR-155/FOXO3a/ARC Axis,"Emerging literature suggests that pyroptosis plays a critical role in ischemia/hypoxia (I/R) -induced myocardial injury. Melatonin has been implicated in attenuating I/R-induced injury of cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, whether melatonin inhibits I/R-induced pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unexploited.H9c2 cardiomyocytes were cultured under oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) condition to establish a myocardial pyroptosis model in vitro. OGD/R-induced pyroptosis was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, IL-1Î² and IL-18 release, and western blotting. Luciferase reporter assay was utilized to validate the association between miR-155 and Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a).Melatonin could inhibit OGD/R-induced pyroptosis of H9c2 cells and upregulation of FOXO3a contributed to the antipyroptotic effect of melatonin. Melatonin reduced miR-155 expression, which led to FOXO3a upregulation and inhibition of pyroptosis in OGD/R-exposed H9c2 cells. miR-155 inhibitor enhanced the antipyroptotic effect of melatonin in OGD/R-exposed H9c2 cells. Melatonin-induced downregulation of miR-155 and upregulation of FOXO3a were reversed by melatonin receptor 2 (MT2) siRNA. Melatonin treatment also led to an increased level of apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC), which was inhibited by FOXO3a siRNA. Moreover, silencing ARC by siRNA significantly blocked the antipyroptotic actions of melatonin, whereas ARC overexpression enhanced the antipyroptotic actions of melatonin in OGD/R-exposed H9c2 cells.Our findings demonstrated that melatonin prevented OGD/R-induced pyroptosis via regulating the MT2/miR-155/FOXO3a/ARC axis in cardiomyocytes.",-1
Intermuscular adipose tissue directly modulates skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in humans,"Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is negatively related to insulin sensitivity, but a causal role of IMAT in the development of insulin resistance is unknown. IMAT was sampled in humans to test for the ability to induce insulin resistance in vitro and characterize gene expression to uncover how IMAT may promote skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Human primary muscle cells were incubated with conditioned media from IMAT, visceral (VAT), or subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to evaluate changes in insulin sensitivity. RNAseq analysis was performed on IMAT with gene expression compared with skeletal muscle and SAT, and relationships to insulin sensitivity were determined in men and women spanning a wide range of insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Conditioned media from IMAT and VAT decreased insulin sensitivity similarly compared with SAT. Multidimensional scaling analysis revealed distinct gene expression patterns in IMAT compared with SAT and muscle. Pathway analysis revealed that IMAT expression of genes in insulin signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, and peroxisomal metabolism related positively to donor insulin sensitivity, whereas expression of macrophage markers, inflammatory cytokines, and secreted extracellular matrix proteins were negatively related to insulin sensitivity. Perilipin 5 gene expression suggested greater IMAT lipolysis in insulin-resistant individuals. Combined, these data show that factors secreted from IMAT modulate muscle insulin sensitivity, possibly via secretion of inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins, and by increasing local FFA concentration in humans. These data suggest IMAT may be an important regulator of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and could be a novel therapeutic target for skeletal muscle insulin resistance.",-1
Cortisol inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in bovine endometrial stromal cells via NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways,"Bovine uterine infection is commonly caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). Elevated concentrations of plasma cortisol have been reported in postpartum cows. However, the direct role of cortisol in the inflammatory response of bovine endometrial stromal cells (BESCs) remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore the regulatory effect of cortisol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in BESCs. Both the primary and immortalized BESCs were used in this study. BESCs were treated with cortisol (5, 15, and 30 ng/mL) in the presence of LPS. The mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was detected using RT-qPCR. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to analyze the activation of the NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways. The results revealed that cortisol downregulated the LPS-induced overexpression of interleukin(IL)-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, TNF-Î±, COX-2, iNOS in BESCs. Moreover, cortisol inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation levels of IÎºB, p65, ERK1/2, JNK and p38, and p65 nuclear translocation in BESCs. These results indicated that cortisol inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory response in BESCs, which may be mediated by suppressing the NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways.",-1
Deep Learning for Ocular Disease Recognition: An Inner-Class Balance,"It can be challenging for doctors to identify eye disorders early enough using fundus pictures. Diagnosing ocular illnesses by hand is time-consuming, error-prone, and complicated. Therefore, an automated ocular disease detection system with computer-aided tools is necessary to detect various eye disorders using fundus pictures. Such a system is now possible as a consequence of deep learning algorithms that have improved image classification capabilities. A deep-learning-based approach to targeted ocular detection is presented in this study. For this study, we used state-of-the-art image classification algorithms, such as VGG-19, to classify the ODIR dataset, which contains 5000 images of eight different classes of the fundus. These classes represent different ocular diseases. However, the dataset within these classes is highly unbalanced. To resolve this issue, the work suggested converting this multiclass classification problem into a binary classification problem and taking the same number of images for both classifications. Then, the binary classifications were trained with VGG-19. The accuracy of the VGG-19 model was 98.13% for the normal (N) versus pathological myopia (M) class; the model reached an accuracy of 94.03% for normal (N) versus cataract (C), and the model provided an accuracy of 90.94% for normal (N) versus glaucoma (G). All of the other models also improve the accuracy when the data is balanced.",-1
Rare transmission of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut microbiome of hospitalized adults,"Bacterial bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Although previous research has demonstrated that pathogens may translocate from the gut microbiome into the bloodstream to cause infections, the mechanisms by which HCT patients acquire pathogens in their microbiome have not yet been described. Here, we use linked-read and short-read metagenomic sequencing to analyze 401 stool samples collected from 149 adults undergoing HCT and hospitalized in the same unit over three years, many of whom were roommates. We use metagenomic assembly and strain-specific comparison methods to search for high-identity bacterial strains, which may indicate transmission between the gut microbiomes of patients. Overall, the microbiomes of patients who share time and space in the hospital do not converge in taxonomic composition. However, we do observe six pairs of patients who harbor identical or nearly identical strains of the pathogen Enterococcus faecium, or the gut commensals Akkermansia muciniphila and Hungatella hathewayi. These shared strains may result from direct transmission between patients who shared a room and bathroom, acquisition from a common hospital source, or transmission from an unsampled intermediate. We also identify multiple patients with identical strains of species commonly found in commercial probiotics, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. In summary, our findings indicate that sharing of identical pathogens between the gut microbiomes of multiple patients is a rare phenomenon. Furthermore, the observed potential transmission of commensal, immunomodulatory microbes suggests that exposure to other humans may contribute to microbiome reassembly post-HCT.",-1
Gut microbiome-mediated regulation of neuroinflammation,"The intestinal microbiome influences neuroinflammatory disease in animal models, and recent studies have identified multiple pathways of communication between the gut and brain. Microbes are able to produce metabolites that enter circulation, can alter inflammatory tone in the intestines, periphery, and central nervous system (CNS), and affect trafficking of immune cells into the brain. Additionally, the vagus nerve that connects the enteric nervous system to the CNS is implicated in modulation of brain immune responses. As preclinical research findings and concepts are applied to humans, the potential impacts of the gut microbiome-brain axis on neuroinflammation represent exciting frontiers for further investigation.",-1
Nrf2-Activating Bioactive Peptides Exert Anti-Inflammatory Activity through Inhibition of the NF-ÎºB Pathway,"Redox status and inflammation are related to the pathogenesis of the majority of diseases. Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-ÎºB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-Î±, the levels of NF-ÎºB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-Î± alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-Î±) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-ÎºB pathway.",-1
Detrimental effects of pyriproxyfen on the detoxification and abilities of Belostoma anurum to prey upon Aedes aegypti larvae,"Despite being effective in controlling mosquito larvae and a few other target organisms, the application of insecticides into aquatic systems may cause unintended alterations to the physiology or behavioral responses of several aquatic non-target organisms, which can ultimately lead to their death. Here, we firstly evaluated whether the susceptibility of the giant water bug, Belostoma anurum (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae), a predator of mosquito larvae, to pyriproxyfen would be similar to that of its potential prey, larvae of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). Secondly, we recorded the nominal concentrations of pyriproxyfen in water and evaluated whether sublethal exposures would lead to physiological or behavioral alterations on the B. anurum nymphs. We characterized the activities of three major families of detoxification enzymes (i.e., cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione-S-transferase, and general esterases) and further evaluated the abilities of pyriproxyfen sublethally-exposed B. anurum to prey upon A. aegypti larvae at different prey densities. Our findings revealed that nominal pyriproxyfen concentration significantly decreased (approximately 50%) over the first 24 h. Furthermore, when applied at the concentration of 10 Î¼g a.i./L, pyriproxyfen was approximately four times more toxic to A. aegypti larvae (LT50 = 48 h) than to B. anurum nymphs (LT50 = 192 h). Interestingly, the pyriproxyfen sublethally-exposed (2.5 Î¼g a.i./L) B. anurum nymphs exhibited reduced enzyme activities (cytochrome P450 monooxygenases) involved in detoxication processes and preyed significantly less on A. aegypti larvae when compared to unexposed predators. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that mortality-based pyriproxyfen risk assessments are not always protective of aquatic non-target organisms.",-1
Ablation of uncoupling protein 3 affects interrelated factors leading to lipolysis and insulin resistance in visceral white adipose tissue,"The physiological role played by uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) in white adipose tissue (WAT) has not been elucidated so far. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of the absence of the whole body UCP3 on WAT physiology in terms of ability to store triglycerides, oxidative capacity, response to insulin, inflammation, and adipokine production. Wild type (WT) and UCP3 Knockout (KO) mice housed at thermoneutrality (30Â°C) have been used as the animal model. Visceral gonadic WAT (gWAT) from KO mice showed an impaired capacity to store triglycerides (TG) as indicated by its lowered weight, reduced adipocyte diameter, and higher glycerol release (index of lipolysis). The absence of UCP3 reduces the maximal oxidative capacity of gWAT, increases mitochondrial free radicals, and activates ER stress. These processes are associated with increased levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and TNF-Î±. The response of gWAT to in vivo insulin administration, revealed by (ser473)-AKT phosphorylation, was blunted in KO mice, with a putative role played by eif2a, JNK, and inflammation. Variations in adipokine levels in the absence of UCP3 were observed, including reduced adiponectin levels both in gWAT and serum. As a whole, these data indicate an important role of UCP3 in regulating the metabolic functionality of gWAT, with its absence leading to metabolic derangement. The obtained results help to clarify some aspects of the association between metabolic disorders and low UCP3 levels.",-1
Progressive compressive sensing of large images with multiscale deep learning reconstruction,"Compressive sensing (CS) is a sub-Nyquist sampling framework that has been employed to improve the performance of numerous imaging applications during the last 15 years. Yet, its application for large and high-resolution imaging remains challenging in terms of the computation and acquisition effort involved. Often, low-resolution imaging is sufficient for most of the considered tasks and only a fraction of cases demand high resolution, but the problem is that the user does not know in advance when high-resolution acquisition is required. To address this, we propose a multiscale progressive CS method for the high-resolution imaging. The progressive sampling refines the resolution of the image, while incorporating the already sampled low-resolution information, making the process highly efficient. Moreover, the multiscale property of the progressively sensed samples is capitalized for a fast, deep learning (DL) reconstruction, otherwise infeasible due to practical limitations of training on high-resolution images. The progressive CS and the multiscale reconstruction method are analyzed numerically and demonstrated experimentally with a single pixel camera imaging system. We demonstrate 4-megapixel size progressive compressive imaging with about half the overall number of samples, more than an order of magnitude faster reconstruction, and improved reconstruction quality compared to alternative conventional CS approaches.",-1
Exosomes Derived from Mesenchymal Stem Cells Ameliorate the Progression of Atherosclerosis in ApoE -/- Mice via FENDRR,"Exosomes (EXO) are extracellular vesicles with lipid bilayer membrane structure containing noncoding RNA, DNA, and other molecules which mediate biological functions. The importance of EXO derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been underlined in cardiovascular diseases. However, the functional role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) released by MSCs-EXO on atherosclerosis (AS) was unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of lncRNA fetal-lethal non-coding developmental regulatory RNA (FENDRR) released from MSC-derived EXO on AS. The accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) caused AS in mice and damage to human vascular endothelial cells (HUV-EC-C). MSC-EXO restored HUV-EC-C activity and alleviated arterial injury. LncRNA microarrays revealed that FENDRR was delivered to cells and tissues by MSC-EXO. FENDRR bound to microRNA (miR)-28 to regulate TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) expression. Moreover, FENDRR knockdown exacerbated cell injury and arterial injury in mice. miR-28 inhibitor reversed the effects of FENDRR silencing and reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation. While loss of TEAD1 mitigated the effect of miR-28 inhibitor and accentuated HUV-EC-C injury in vitro and AS symptoms in vivo. Our results demonstrated that MSC-EXO secreted FENDRR to treat AS. FENDRR competed with TEAD1 to bind to miR-28, thereby reducing HUV-EC-C injury and atherosclerotic plaque formation.",-1
Bacteriophage therapy for empyema caused by carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent causative agent of post-pneumonectomy empyema-associated broncho-pleural fistula (BPF) and it has a high mortality rate. In recent years, the therapeutic potential of bacteriophage therapy has recognized anew as antimicrobial resistance increases globally. Studies are increasingly reporting the efficacy and safety of bacteriophage therapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. However, the clinical efficacy of bacteriophage therapy in empyema has seldom been studied. The current study reports the authors' experience with bacteriophage therapy for a 68-year-old Chinese man who suffered BPF-associated empyema and pneumonia caused by carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa. A personalized lytic pathogen-specific two-phage preparation was administered to the patient continuously for 24 days in combination with conventional antibiotics. The treatment was well-tolerated, resulting in clearance of the pathogen and improvement of the clinical outcome. This experience shows that a combined conventional antibiotic treatment with bacteriophage therapy may be effective at alleviating a multidrug-resistant bacterial infection in BPF-associated empyema.",-1
A Possible Role for HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors and Its Association with HMGCR Genetic Variation in Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterised by both motor- and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment. The aetiopathogenesis of PD, as well as its protective and susceptibility factors, are still elusive. Neuroprotective effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors-statins-via both cholesterol-dependent and independent mechanisms have been shown in animal and cell culture models. However, the available data provide conflicting results on the role of statin treatment in PD patients. Moreover, cholesterol is a vital component for brain functions and may be considered as protective against PD. We present possible statin effects on PD under the hypothesis that they may depend on the HMG-CoA reductase gene (HMGCR) variability, such as haplotype 7, which was shown to affect cholesterol synthesis and statin treatment outcome, diminishing possible neuroprotection associated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors administration. Statins are among the most prescribed groups of drugs. Thus, it seems important to review the available data in the context of their possible neuroprotective effects in PD, and the HMG-CoA reductase gene's genetic variability.",-1
Generating mutant Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system,"Implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 methodologies for mosquito gene editing has not yet become widespread. This protocol details the procedure for Aedes aegypti mosquito gene editing using homology-directed repair and fluorescent marker insertion, which facilitates the generation and screening of mutant mosquito lines for gene function testing. We describe optimized methods for single guide RNA plasmid preparation, homologous recombination donor plasmid construction, embryo microinjection, and precise gene knock-in confirmation.

Analyses of IGFBP2 DNA methylation and mRNA expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues of obese subjects,"Insulin-like growth factor binding-protein 2 (IGFBP-2) is secreted by differentiating white adipocytes. Clinical studies demonstrate that circulating IGFBP-2 levels associated inversely with body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance. To explore possible epigenetic changes of the IGFBP2 gene in obesity, we analyzed DNA methylation and mRNA expression in adipocytes from different depots. Healthy lean controls (BMI = 24.5 Â± 0.3 kg/m2, n = 19) and obese subjects (BMI > 35 kg/m2, n = 24) were recruited. All subjects were Swedish Caucasian. Visceral abdominal adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) fragments were homogenized. Genomic DNA and total RNAs were extracted. Four CpG sites in the IGFBP2 gene promoter region were analyzed with bisulfite pyrosequencing. IGFBP2 gene expression at mRNA levels was determined with TaqMan real time RT-PCR. Serum samples were used for measurement of circulating IGFBP-2 and leptin levels. IGFBP2 DNA methylation levels in VAT were increased in obese subjects compared with controls (P < .05). By contrast, IGFBP2 mRNA expression levels in VAT were lower in obesity subjects than in controls (P < .05). In SAT, IGFBP2 DNA methylation and RNA expression levels were lower than in VAT, irrespective of obesity. Obese subjects demonstrated increased serum leptin levels (P < .001) and reduced serum IGFBP-2 levels compared to controls (P < .05). In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that IGFBP2 DNA methylation levels are increased in VAT from obese subjects. This suggests that IGFBP-2 is epigenetically regulated in abdominal obesity.",-1
Dietary Blueberry Ameliorates Vascular Complications in Diabetic Mice Possibly through NOX4 and Modulates Composition and Functional Diversity of Gut Microbes,"Scope:                    In diabetes, endothelial inflammation and dysfunction play a pivotal role in the development of vascular disease. This study investigates the effect of dietary blueberries on vascular complications and gut microbiome in diabetic mice.              Methods and results:                    Seven-week-old diabetic db/db mice consume a standard diet (db/db) or a diet supplemented with 3.8% freeze-dried blueberry (db/db+BB) for 10 weeks. Control db/+ mice are fed a standard diet (db/+). Vascular inflammation is assessed by measuring monocyte binding to vasculature and inflammatory markers. Isometric tension procedures are used to assess mesenteric artery function. db/db mice exhibit enhanced vascular inflammation and reduced endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation as compared to db/+ mice, but these are improved in db/db+BB mice. Blueberry supplementation reduces the expression of NOX4 and IÎºKÎ² in the aortic vessel and vascular endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from db/db+BB compared to db/db mice. The blueberry metabolites serum reduces glucose and palmitate induced endothelial inflammation in mouse aortic ECs. Further, blueberry supplementation increases commensal microbes and modulates the functional potential of gut microbes in diabetic mice.              Conclusion:                    Dietary blueberry suppresses vascular inflammation, attenuates arterial endothelial dysfunction, and supports the growth of commensal microbes in diabetic mice. The endothelial-specific vascular benefits of blueberries are mediated through NOX4 signaling.",-1
Role of Vitamin K in Intestinal Health,"Intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and colorectal cancer (CRC) generally characterized by clinical symptoms, including malabsorption, intestinal dysfunction, injury, and microbiome imbalance, as well as certain secondary intestinal disease complications, continue to be serious public health problems worldwide. The role of vitamin K (VK) on intestinal health has drawn growing interest in recent years. In addition to its role in blood coagulation and bone health, several investigations continue to explore the role of VK as an emerging novel biological compound with the potential function of improving intestinal health. This study aims to present a thorough review on the bacterial sources, intestinal absorption, uptake of VK, and VK deficiency in patients with intestinal diseases, with emphasis on the effect of VK supplementation on immunity, anti-inflammation, intestinal microbes and its metabolites, antioxidation, and coagulation, and promoting epithelial development. Besides, VK-dependent proteins (VKDPs) are another crucial mechanism for VK to exert a gastroprotection role for their functions of anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and anti-tumorigenesis. In summary, published studies preliminarily show that VK presents a beneficial effect on intestinal health and may be used as a therapeutic drug to prevent/treat intestinal diseases, but the specific mechanism of VK in intestinal health has yet to be elucidated.",-1
Visceral obesity and short-term outcomes after laparoscopic rectal cancer resection,"Background:                    Complications after rectal resection are frequent. Recently, methods to assess visceral obesity (VO) have become available as an alternative to measurement of body mass index (BMI). The aim of this study was to examine the association between visceral fat volume (VFV) and the short-term outcomes after laparoscopic low anterior resection (LLAR) in patients with rectal cancer.              Methods:                    We studied a consecutive series of patients undergoing LLAR at Bispebjerg University Hospital from 01.01.2013 to 01.01.2016. Preoperative VFV was calculated from abdominal CT scans using an automatic segmentation tool. The primary outcome was anastomotic leakage (AL). Secondary outcomes included conversion to open surgery, number of lymph nodes harvested, the rates of 30-day complications as well as reoperations, and 1-year survival.              Results:                    A total of 102 patients were included. VO was defined as a VFV above the 75 percentile. Thirteen (12.7%) patients developed AL, four (15.4%) of whom were in the VO group (p = 0.900). At least one postoperative complication developed in 38 (37.3%) patients, with no significant difference between the VO and non-VO patients after univariable analysis (42.3% vs. 35.4%, p = 0.702) or multivariable adjustment (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.38-2.65, p = 0.984). VO was significantly associated with an increased incidence of conversion to open surgery (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.29-14.86, p = 0.018). There was a significant difference in the number of harvested lymph nodes between the two groups (mean 23.5 vs. 29.1, p = 0.045).              Conclusions:                    In this study on patients undergoing laparoscopic rectal resection, VO was not associated with development of AL or other complications. However, we found that visceral obesity was associated with an increased risk of conversion to open surgery.",-1
Physics-Coupled Neural Network Magnetic Resonance Electrical Property Tomography (MREPT) for Conductivity Reconstruction,"The electrical property (EP) of human tissues is a quantitative biomarker that facilitates early diagnosis of cancerous tissues. Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography (MREPT) is an imaging modality that reconstructs EPs by the radio-frequency field in an MRI system. MREPT reconstructs EPs by solving analytic models numerically based on Maxwell's equations. Most MREPT methods suffer from artifacts caused by inaccuracy of the hypotheses behind the models, and/or numerical errors. These artifacts can be mitigated by adding coefficients to stabilize the models, however, the selection of such coefficient has been empirical, which limit its medical application. Alternatively, end-to-end Neural networks-based MREPT (NN-MREPT) learns to reconstruct the EPs from training samples, circumventing Maxwell's equations. However, due to its pattern-matching nature, it is difficult for NN-MREPT to produce accurate reconstructions for new samples. In this work, we proposed a physics-coupled NN for MREPT (PCNN-MREPT), in which an analytic model, cr-MREPT, works with diffusion and convection coefficients, learned by NNs from the difference between the reconstructed and ground-truth EPs to reduce artifacts. With two simulated datasets, three generalization experiments in which test samples deviate gradually from the training samples, and one noise-robustness experiment were conducted. The results show that the proposed PCNN-MREPT achieves higher accuracy than two representative analytic methods. Moreover, compared with an end-to-end NN-MREPT, the proposed method attained higher accuracy in two critical generalization tests. This is an important step to practical MREPT medical diagnoses.",-1
Knockdown of circ_CDYL Contributes to Inhibit Angiotensin II-Induced Podocytes Apoptosis in Membranous Nephropathy via the miR-149-5p/TNFSF11 Pathway,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been verified as vital regulators in various diseases, including membranous nephropathy (MN). Therefore, the role of circ_CDYL in podocyte apoptosis and MN was investigated. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure the expression of circ_CDYL, microRNA-149-5p (miR-149-5p), and tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11) in podocytes. In addition, angiotensin II (Ang II) was used to induce apoptosis of podocytes. The apoptosis-related protein expression was quantified by western blot assay. The apoptosis of podocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry assay. The interaction relationship between miR-149-5p and circ_CDYL or TNFSF11 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Circ_CDYL was significantly overexpressed in MN patients and Ang II-induced podocytes compared with control groups. Importantly, loss-of-functional experiments indicated that knockdown of circ_CDYL protected podocytes from Ang II-induced apoptosis. MiR-149-5p was verified as target of circ_CDYL and negatively correlated with circ_CDYL expression in MN patients. Knockdown of circ_CDYL-mediated effects on Ang II-induced podocyte cells were abolished by silencing miR-149-5p. Besides, the upregulation of miR-149-5p could suppress apoptosis in Ang II-induced podocyte cells by targeting TNFSF11. Under Ang II stimulation, the upregulation of TNFSF11 could increase the expression of TNFSF11 and induce apoptosis in circ_CDYL-silencing podocytes. Our results confirmed that circ_CDYL specifically targeted miR-149-5p/TNFSF11 pathway to regulate Ang II-induced apoptosis in podocytes, which might be useful diagnostic biomarkers in MN.",-1
Current Effector and Gene-Drive Developments to Engineer Arbovirus-Resistant Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) for a Sustainable Population Replacement Strategy in the Field,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses cause morbidity and mortality among human populations living in the tropical regions of the world. Conventional mosquito control efforts based on insecticide treatments and/or the use of bednets and window curtains are currently insufficient to reduce arbovirus prevalence in affected regions. Novel, genetic strategies that are being developed involve the genetic manipulation of mosquitoes for population reduction and population replacement purposes. Population replacement aims at replacing arbovirus-susceptible wild-type mosquitoes in a target region with those that carry a laboratory-engineered antiviral effector to interrupt arboviral transmission in the field. The strategy has been primarily developed for Aedes aegypti (L.), the most important urban arbovirus vector. Antiviral effectors based on long dsRNAs, miRNAs, or ribozymes destroy viral RNA genomes and need to be linked to a robust gene drive to ensure their fixation in the target population. Synthetic gene-drive concepts are based on toxin/antidote, genetic incompatibility, and selfish genetic element principles. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system can be configurated as a homing endonuclease gene (HEG) and HEG-based drives became the preferred choice for mosquitoes. HEGs are highly allele and nucleotide sequence-specific and therefore sensitive to single-nucleotide polymorphisms/resistant allele formation. Current research efforts test new HEG-based gene-drive designs that promise to be less sensitive to resistant allele formation. Safety aspects in conjunction with gene drives are being addressed by developing procedures that would allow a recall or overwriting of gene-drive transgenes once they have been released.",-1
Gut Microbiota as the Potential Mechanism to Mediate Drug Metabolism Under High-altitude Hypoxia,"Background:                    The characteristics of pharmacokinetics and the activity and expression of drugmetabolizing enzymes and transporters significantly change under a high-altitude hypoxic environment. Gut microbiota is an important factor affecting the metabolism of drugs through direct or indirect effects, changing the bioavailability, biological activity, or toxicity of drugs and further affecting the efficacy and safety of drugs in vivo. A high-altitude hypoxic environment significantly changes the structure and diversity of gut microbiota, which may play a key role in drug metabolism under a high-altitude hypoxic environment.              Methods:                    An investigation was carried out by reviewing published studies to determine the role of gut microbiota in the regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Data and information on expression change in gut microbiota, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and transporters under a high-altitude hypoxic environment were explored and proposed.              Results:                    High-altitude hypoxia is an important environmental factor that can adjust the structure of the gut microbiota and change the diversity of intestinal microbes. It was speculated that the gut microbiota could regulate drugmetabolizing enzymes through two potential mechanisms, the first being through direct regulation of the metabolism of drugs in vivo and the second being indirect, i.e., through the regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, thereby affecting the activity of drugs.              Conclusion:                    This article reviews the effects of high-altitude hypoxia on the gut microbiota and the effects of these changes on drug metabolism.",-1
Review of Issues on Residual Malaria Transmission,"Residual malaria transmission is the actual maintained inoculation of Plasmodium, in spite of a well-designed and implemented vector control programs, and is of great concern for malaria elimination. Residual malaria transmission occurs under several possible circumstances, among which the presence of exophilic vector species, such as Anopheles dirus, or indoor- and outdoor-biting vectors, such as Anopheles nili, or specific behavior, such as feeding on humans indoors, then resting or leaving the house the same night (such as Anopheles moucheti) or also changes in behavior induced by insecticides applied inside houses, such as the well-known deterrent effect of permethrin-treated nets or the irritant effect of DDT. The use of insecticides may change the composition of local Anopheles populations, such as A. arabiensis taking up the place of A. gambiae in Senegal, A. aquasalis replacing A. darlingi in Guyana, or A. harrisoni superseding A. minimus in Vietnam. The change in behavior, such as biting activity earlier than usually reported-for example, Anopheles funestus after a large-scale distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets-or insecticide resistance, in particular the current spread of pyrethroid resistance, could hamper the efficacy of classic pyrethroid-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets and maintained transmission. These issues must be well documented in every situation to elaborate, implement, monitor, and evaluate tailored vector control programs, keeping in mind that they must be conceived as integrated programs with several well and appropriately coordinated approaches, combining entomological but also parasitological, clinical, and social methods and analyses. A successful integrated vector control program must then be designed to reduce transmission and incidence rates of malaria morbidity and overall mortality.",-1
The Potential Prebiotic Berberine Combined With Methimazole Improved the Therapeutic Effect of Graves' Disease Patients Through Regulating the Intestinal Microbiome,"Graves' disease, a typical metabolism disorder, causes diffuse goiter accompanied by ocular abnormalities and ocular dysfunction. Although methimazole (MI) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of GD, the efficacy of methimazole is only limited to the control of clinical indicators, and the side effects of MI should be seriously considered. Here, we designed a 6-month clinical trial that divided the patients into two groups: a methimazole group (n=8) and a methimazole combined with potential prebiotic berberine group (n=10). The effects of both treatments on thyroid function and treatment outcomes in patients with GD were assessed by thyroid index measurements and gut microbiota metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that the addition of berberine restored the patients' TSH and FT3 indices to normal levels, whereas MI alone restored only FT3. In addition, TRAb was closer to the healthy threshold at the end of treatment with the drug combination. MI alone failed to modulate the gut microbiota of the patients. However, the combination of berberine with methimazole significantly altered the microbiota structure of the patients, increasing the abundance of the beneficial bacteria Lactococcus lactis while decreasing the abundance of the pathogenic bacteria Enterobacter hormaechei and Chryseobacterium indologenes. Furthermore, further mechanistic exploration showed that the addition of berberine resulted in a significant upregulation of the synthesis of enterobactin, which may have increased iron functioning and thus restored thyroid function. In conclusion, methimazole combined with berberine has better efficacy in patients with GD, suggesting the potential benefit of berberine combined with methimazole in modulating the composition of intestinal microbes in the treatment of GD, providing new strong evidence for the effectiveness of combining Chinese and Western drugs from the perspective of modulating the intestinal microbiota.",-1
Effect of Parental Photoperiod on Body Size and Developmental Time of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Buenos Aires City,"Many insects use photoperiod as a signal to anticipate upcoming unfavorable conditions. Photoperiod sensitivity may be a relevant factor in Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) populations at the cool margins of the species' range, where winter conditions have a strong effect on population dynamics. In this study, we evaluated the effect of parental photoperiod on preimaginal survival and developmental time, and on wing length for the first generation of Ae. aegypti from a temperate region (Buenos Aires City, Argentina). Our experiment started with eggs from parents exposed to short-day (SD; 10:14 [L:D]) or long-day (LD; 14:10 [L:D]) photoperiods during their entire life span. Eggs were stored under the same photoperiod (SD or LD) as their parents for 91 d, until immersion. After hatching, larvae were reared until adult emergence in thermal baths at one of two constant temperatures (17 or 23Â°C), at a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h and fed ad libitum. Survival from larva I to adult emergence was not affected either by parental photoperiod or rearing temperature. At a rearing temperature of 23Â°C, female offspring from the SD parental photoperiod developed faster and had shorter wings compared with those from the LD parental photoperiod. No effect of parental photoperiod was observed on female offspring reared at 17Â°C. In male offspring, parental photoperiod had no effect on developmental time and wing length, independently of the rearing temperature. Results indicate that the parental photoperiod may affect some offspring traits. This effect may be a characteristic of Ae. aegypti populations in temperate regions to deal with the winter conditions.",-1
"Circular RNA circ_0130438 suppresses TNF-Î±-induced proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammation in human fibroblast-like MH7A synoviocytes by regulating miR-130a-3p/KLF9 axis","Background:                    Circular RNAs (circRNAs) can play a critical role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis by involving gene regulation by competing for shared microRNAs (miRNAs), a family of small noncoding RNAs. MiR-130a-3p is a disease-related miRNA and Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) is a zinc finger transcription factor, which are involved in RA pathogenesis. Here, we identified the action of circRNA circ_0130438 in regulating fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) stimulated by tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±).              Methods:                    The direct relationship between miR-130a-3p and circRNA circ_0130438 or KLF9 was predicted by bioinformatics analysis and examined by a dual-luciferase reporter or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. CircRNA circ_0130438, miR-130a-3p and KLF9 factor expression levels were gauged by a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or a western blot method. Cell proliferation ability was analyzed by a 5-Ethynyl-2'-Deoxyuridine (EdU) staining assay. The transwell assay was used to evaluate cell migration and invasion capacities. The production levels of interleukin-1Î² (IL)-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).              Results:                    The level of circRNA circ_0130438 was reduced in RA tissues (P = 0.0001) and FLSs isolated from RA tissues (P = 0.0001) compared with corresponding normal controls. Exposure of human fibroblast-like MH7A synoviocytes to TNF-Î± suppressed circRNA circ_0130438 expression (P < 0.0001). In contrast, the elevated expression of circRNA circ_0130438 suppressed the TNF-Î±-induced proliferation (P = 0.0047) and migration (P = 0.0023) of MH7A cells, as well as their pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8) production (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001). The circRNA circ_0130438 contained a miR-130a-3p binding site. Furthermore, the increase of miR-130-3p in TNF-Î±-stimulated MH7A cells reversed the effects of circRNA circ_0130438 elevation on cell proliferation (P = 0.0006), migration (P = 0.0406) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8) production (P = 0.0036, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0004), indicating that miR-130a-3p was a functional mediator of circRNA circ_0130438 regulation. We also documented that KLF9 was a direct target and downstream effector of miR-130a-3p. Importantly, circRNA circ_0130438 enhanced KLF9 expression (P < 0.0001) in TNF-Î±-stimulated MH7A cells by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-130a-3p (P = 0.0004).              Conclusion:                    Our findings demonstrate that the elevated expression of circRNA circ_0130438 suppresses TNF-Î±-induced migration, proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8) production of human MH7A cells by enhancing KLF9 expression by operating as a ceRNA for miR-130a-3p.",-1
Measurement of Visceral Adipose Tissue in Persons With Spinal Cord Injury by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry: Generation and Application of a Predictive Equation,"Purpose:                    Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) permits quantification of visceral adipose tissue (VAT). However, DXA has not been validated against MRI in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). A predictive equation was generated from the measurement of VAT by MRI, a ""gold"" standard to quantitate VAT, compared to that of DXA, a method with several practical advantages.              Method:                    DXA and MRI scans were performed in 27 participants with SCI. MRI multiaxial images were captured for VAT analysis. DXA-VAT was quantified at the android region (DXA-VATANDROID-VOL) using enCore software. Android regions of DXA and MRI were matched using android height. Volumes of multiaxial MRI-VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were quantified for the android region (MRI-VATANDROID-VOL, MRI-SATANDROID-VOL) and total trunk (MRI-VATANDROID-VOL). Linear regression analysis was used to establish the proposed predication equations. The prediction equations were then applied to an independent sample that consisted of 98 participants with SCI. Bland-Altman analysis was used to determine the limits of agreement.              Results:                    DXA-VATANDROID-VOL predicted 92% of the variance in MRI-VATANDROID-VOL (SEE = 252.5, p < 0.0005) and 85% of the variance in MRI-VATTRUNK-VOL (SEE = 1526.9, p < 0.0005). DXA-SATANDROID-VOL predicted 81.5% of the variance in MRI-SATANDROID-VOL (SEE = 458.2, p < 0.0005). Bland-Altman analysis revealed a high level of agreement between MRI-VATANDROID-VOL and DXA-VATANDROID-VOL (mean bias = 58.45 cm3). A predicted mean DXA-VATANDROID-VOL of 995.2 cm3 was estimated as the population-specific cut-off point for high levels of VAT.              Conclusion:                    DXA-VATANDROID-VOL may accurately predict MRI-VATANDROID-VOL in persons with SCI. The ability of DXA to detect VAT changes in longitudinal studies in persons with SCI should be performed.",-1
Implication of microRNAs in Carcinogenesis with Emphasis on Hematological Malignancies and Clinical Translation,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved small non-coding RNAs, that are involved in the multistep process of carcinogenesis, contributing to all established hallmarks of cancer. In this review, implications of miRNAs in hematological malignancies and their clinical utilization fields are discussed. As components of the complex regulatory network of gene expression, influenced by the tissue microenvironment and epigenetic modifiers, miRNAs are ""micromanagers"" of all physiological processes including the regulation of hematopoiesis and metabolic pathways. Dysregulated miRNA expression levels contribute to both the initiation and progression of acute leukemias, the metabolic reprogramming of malignantly transformed hematopoietic precursors, and to the development of chemoresistance. Since they are highly stable and can be easily quantified in body fluids and tissue specimens, miRNAs are promising biomarkers for the early detection of hematological malignancies. Besides novel opportunities for differential diagnosis, miRNAs can contribute to advanced chemoresistance prediction and prognostic stratification of acute leukemias. Synthetic oligonucleotides and delivery vehicles aim the therapeutic modulation of miRNA expression levels. However, major challenges such as efficient delivery to specific locations, differences of miRNA expression patterns between pediatric and adult hematological malignancies, and potential side effects of miRNA-based therapies should be considered.",-1
Derivation of a natural language processing algorithm to identify febrile infants,"Background:                    Diagnostic codes can retrospectively identify samples of febrile infants, but sensitivity is low, resulting in many febrile infants eluding detection. To ensure study samples are representative, an improved approach is needed.              Objective:                    To derive and internally validate a natural language processing algorithm to identify febrile infants and compare its performance to diagnostic codes.              Methods:                    This cross-sectional study consisted of infants aged 0-90 days brought to one pediatric emergency department from January 2016 to December 2017. We aimed to identify infants with fever, defined as a documented temperature â?8Â°C. We used 2017 clinical notes to develop two rule-based algorithms to identify infants with fever and tested them on data from 2016. Using manual abstraction as the gold standard, we compared performance of the two rule-based algorithms (Models 1, 2) to four previously published diagnostic code groups (Models 5-8) using area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity.              Results:                    For the test set (n = 1190 infants), 184 infants were febrile (15.5%). The AUCs (0.92-0.95) and sensitivities (86%-92%) of Models 1 and 2 were significantly greater than Models 5-8 (0.67-0.74; 20%-74%) with similar specificities (93%-99%). In contrast to Models 5-8, samples from Models 1 and 2 demonstrated similar characteristics to the gold standard, including fever prevalence, median age, and rates of bacterial infections, hospitalizations, and severe outcomes.              Conclusions:                    Findings suggest rule-based algorithms can accurately identify febrile infants with greater sensitivity while preserving specificity compared to diagnostic codes. If externally validated, rule-based algorithms may be important tools to create representative study samples, thereby improving generalizability of findings.",-1
Leptin Silencing Attenuates Lipid Accumulation through Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 1 Inhibition in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"Leptin is a crucial regulator of metabolism and energy homeostasis in mammals. Many studies have investigated the impacts of leptin on human cancers, such as proliferation and metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying leptin-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain incompletely understood. In the current study, leptin downregulation ameliorated lipid accumulation, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, diminished leptin by siRNA not only inhibited sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a master regulator of lipid metabolism, at the mRNA and protein levels, but also reduced SREBP1 downstream target expressions, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), in NPC cells. In addition, leptin expression could modulate the promoter activity of SREBP1. We also found that pharmacological inhibition of poly-ADP ribose polymerase-Î³ (PPAR-Î³) resulted in increased SREBP1 expression in leptin-depleted NPC cells. Functionally, SREBP1 overexpression overcame the effects of leptin-silencing attenuated triglyceride level, cholesterol level and cell survival in NPC cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that leptin is an important regulator of lipid metabolism in NPC cells and might could be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of NPC patients.",-1
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal microRNA-381-3p alleviates vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease by targeting NFAT5,"Vascular calcification (VC) is a significant complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cellular apoptosis is one of the intricate mechanisms of VC. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome (BMSC-Exo) alleviates VC, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the mechanism of BMSC-Exo using high phosphate stimulated Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMCs) and 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (SNx) rat models. We demonstrated that the effect of BMSC-Exo on the inhibition of cellular apoptosis and calcification partially depended on exosomal microRNA-381-3p (miR-381-3p) both in vivo and in vitro, and confirmed that miR-381-3p could inhibit Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) expression by directly binding to its 3' untranslated region. Additionally, we found that severe calcification of arteries in dialysis patients was associated with decreased miR-381-3p and increased NFAT5 expression levels. Collectively, our findings proved that BMSC-Exo plays anti-calcification and anti-apoptosis roles in CKD by delivering enclosed miR-381-3p, which directly targets NFAT5 mRNA, and leads to a better understanding of the mechanism of CKD-VC.",-1
Students' Occupational Aspirations: Can Family Relationships Account for Differences Between Immigrant and Socioeconomic Groups?,"Immigrant background and disadvantaged socioeconomic background are two key predictors of poorer school achievement in Europe. However, the former is associated with higher while the latter is associated with lower aspirations. This study asks whether family relationships account for this difference. Data come from 5,926 students in Germany and Sweden, eliciting indicators of family background and relationships at age 14-15 years (2011) and occupational aspirations 1 year later. High aspirations were found among students of non-European background and students with higher parental occupational status. Structural equation models showed that while immigrant families had greater parental aspirations and encouragement, family cohesion, and parental monitoring, only parental aspirations mediated the effects of family background.",-1
Effect of Fish Oil Supplementation on Hepatic and Visceral Fat in Overweight Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Being overweight increases the risk of the development of metabolic conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is itself an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation is recommended for prevention of chronic disease, and is thought to reduce raised liver fat, yet there have been few randomized controlled trials with accurate measurement of liver fat. We assessed the effect of 12 weeks of supplementation with omega-3 PUFA from fish oil versus placebo on quantified liver fat, liver tests, and body composition including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Fifty apparently healthy overweight men (BMI 25.0â?9.9 kg/mÂ²; waist > 94 cm) were randomly allocated to consume fish oil (total daily dose: 1728 mg marine triglycerides, of which 588 mg EPA and 412 mg DHA, combined with 200 mg antioxidant, coenzyme Q10) or placebo (olive oil capsules) daily for 12 weeks. Liver fat was assessed using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and following 6 and 12 weeks of supplementation. Baseline liver fat was 4.6 Â± 0.5% (range: 0.6 to 18.2%); 16 (32%) participants met the criteria for NAFLD (>5.5% liver fat). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant time or group Ã time effect for fish oil versus placebo for liver fat, liver enzymes, anthropometry, or body composition including VAT (p > 0.05 for all), with similar finding for sub-analysis of participants with NAFLD. Omega-3 PUFA did not appear to be an effective agent for reducing liver fat in overweight men. The factors determining the health benefits of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on an individual level need to be clarified.",-1
Cutaneous Metastasis from Transitional Cell Carcinoma of Urinary Bladder,"Cutaneous metastases with a prevalence of 5.3% in all malignancies are rarely observed phenomena in dermatology. Bladder cancers constitute 0.84% of cutaneous metastases; and 90% of these are transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), the commonest bladder malignancy. However, these metastatic cutaneous lesions are notorious for mimicking many dermatological disorders and show poor prognosis. Herein, we report a 51-year male patient who presented with fibrotic or sclerodermoid type lesions on his both legs and trunk due to cutaneous metastases of bladder urothelial carcinoma. We would like to call attention to these rarely observed skin lesions to prevent delayed diagnosis; and emphasise the use of immunohistochemical staining for the determination of the primary origin of the tumour. Key Words: Cutaneous metastasis, Bladder, Urothelial carcinoma.",-1
A geometry-guided multi-beamlet deep learning technique for CT reconstruction,"Purpose. Previous studies have proposed deep-learning techniques to reconstruct CT images from sinograms. However, these techniques employ large fully-connected (FC) layers for projection-to-image domain transformation, producing large models requiring substantial computation power, potentially exceeding the computation memory limit. Our previous work proposed a geometry-guided-deep-learning (GDL) technique for CBCT reconstruction that reduces model size and GPU memory consumption. This study further develops the technique and proposes a novel multi-beamlet deep learning (GMDL) technique of improved performance. The study compares the proposed technique with the FC layer-based deep learning (FCDL) method and the GDL technique through low-dose real-patient CT image reconstruction.Methods. Instead of using a large FC layer, the GMDL technique learns the projection-to-image domain transformation by constructing many small FC layers. In addition to connecting each pixel in the projection domain to beamlet points along the central beamlet in the image domain as GDL does, these smaller FC layers in GMDL connect each pixel to beamlets peripheral to the central beamlet based on the CT projection geometry. We compare ground truth images with low-dose images reconstructed with the GMDL, the FCDL, the GDL, and the conventional FBP methods. The images are quantitatively analyzed in terms of peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), structural-similarity-index-measure (SSIM), and root-mean-square-error (RMSE).Results. Compared to other methods, the GMDL reconstructed low-dose CT images show improved image quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and RMSE. The optimal number of peripheral beamlets for the GMDL technique is two beamlets on each side of the central beamlet. The model size and memory consumption of the GMDL model is less than 1/100 of the FCDL model.Conclusion. Compared to the FCDL method, the GMDL technique is demonstrated to be able to reconstruct real patient low-dose CT images of improved image quality with significantly reduced model size and GPU memory requirement.",-1
Index Evaluation of Different Hospital Management Modes Based on Deep Learning Model,"In order to effectively improve the efficiency of hospital public management, we designed a hospital management index system based on deep learning model and analysed the application effect of reverse broadcast neural network model in hospital. The results show that in the performance analysis of the model, compared with other classical algorithms, the constructed model has the highest accuracy and the shortest delay. The weight analysis of each index in the model shows that the weight of rational utilization rate of beds in tertiary public hospitals is the highest, and the weight of rational utilization rate of beds in secondary public hospitals is the highest. The further analysis of the model training effect shows that the actual value of most output indexes is consistent with the predicted value, and the residual error of the predicted value is close to 0.",-1
The Impact of Preoperative Fasting Duration on Blood Glucose and Hemodynamics in Children,"Background:                    Prolonged preoperative fasting is one of the concerns of pediatricians and anesthesiologists in pediatric surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of preoperative fasting duration on blood glucose and hemodynamics in children.              Methods:                    This cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 children who were between the ages of 3 and 12 years in Besat Hospital, Hamedan, Iran. The time of the last solid and liquid meal taken by child were recorded based on interview with the parents. The first blood glucose test was obtained in the operation room, and the second test was performed 20 minutes after induction of anesthesia by glucometer. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded before anesthesia induction and in five-minute intervals in the first 20 minutes of surgery.              Results:                    The mean age of the children was 6.63 (SD 1.85) years. Mean blood glucose 20 minutes after surgery was 101.17 (SD 92) mg/dl, which was significantly higher than the baseline values (87.66 (SD 11.84) mg/dl) (P < 0.001). The comparison of mean blood glucose level between groups of fasting with different duration for solids (<12 hours and >12 hours) and for liquids (<6 hours and >6 hours) revealed no significant difference in either groups (P > 0.05). No significant correlation was observed between blood glucose level at the induction of anesthesia with weight and age (P > 0.05). There was a significantly negative correlation between duration of fasting for liquids and SBP (P > 0.05).              Conclusion:                    Prolonged preoperative fasting cannot affect blood glucose in children; however, maybe it has impact on systolic blood pressure.",-1
Validity of mHealth devices for counting steps in individuals with Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    Step quantification is a good way to characterize the mobility and functional status of individuals with some functional disorder. Therefore, a validation study may lead to the feasibility of devices to stimulate an increase in the number of steps and physical activity level of individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD).              Aim:                    To investigate the validity of mHealth devices to estimate the number of steps in individuals with PD and compare the estimate with a standard criterion measure.              Method:                    An observational study in a university laboratory with 34 individuals with idiopathic PD. The number of steps was measured using mHealth devices (Google Fit, Health, STEPZ, Pacer, and Fitbit INCÂ®), and compared against a criterionstandard measure during the Two-Minute Walk Test using habitual speed.              Results:                    Our sample was 82% men with a Hoehn and Yahr mean of 2.3 Â± 1.3 and mean walking speed of 1.2 Â± 0.2 m/s. Positive and statistically significant associations were found between Google Fit (r = 0.92; p < 0.01), STEPZ (r = 0.91; p < 0.01), Pacer (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), Health (r = 0.54; p < 0.01), and Fitbit IncÂ® (r = 0.82; p < 0.01) with the criterion-standard measure.              Conclusions:                    GoogleFit, STEPZ, Fitbit Inc.Â®, Pacer, and Health are valid instruments to measure the number of steps over a given period of time with moderate to high correlation with the criterion-standard in individuals with PD. This result shows that technology such as smartphone applications and activity monitor can be used to assess the number of steps in individuals with PD, and allows the possibility of using this technology for assessment and intervention purposes.",-1
Phytotherapy in Integrative Oncology-An Update of Promising Treatment Options,"Modern phytotherapy is part of today's conventional evidence-based medicine and the use of phytopharmaceuticals in integrative oncology is becoming increasingly popular. Approximately 40% of users of such phytopharmaceuticals are tumour patients. The present review provides an overview of the most important plants and nature-based compounds used in integrative oncology and illustrates their pharmacological potential in preclinical and clinical settings. A selection of promising anti-tumour plants and ingredients was made on the basis of scientific evidence and therapeutic practical relevance and included Boswellia, gingko, ginseng, ginger, and curcumin. In addition to these nominees, there is a large number of other interesting plants and plant ingredients that can be considered for the treatment of cancer diseases or for the treatment of tumour or tumour therapy-associated symptoms. Side effects and interactions are included in the discussion. However, with the regular and intended use of phytopharmaceuticals, the occurrence of adverse side effects is rather rare. Overall, the use of defined phytopharmaceuticals is recommended in the context of a rational integrative oncology approach.",-1
A PCR-RFLP method for genotyping of inversion 2Rc in Anopheles coluzzii,"Background:                    Genotyping of polymorphic chromosomal inversions in malaria vectors such as An. coluzzii Coetzee & Wilkerson is important, both because they cause cryptic population structure that can mislead vector analysis and control and because they influence epidemiologically relevant eco-phenotypes. The conventional cytogenetic method of genotyping is an impediment because it is labor intensive, requires specialized training, and can be applied only to one gender and developmental stage. Here, we circumvent these limitations by developing a simple and rapid molecular method of genotyping inversion 2Rc in An. coluzzii that is both economical and field-friendly. This inversion is strongly implicated in temporal and spatial adaptations to climatic and ecological variation, particularly aridity.              Methods:                    Using a set of tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly correlated with inversion orientation, we identified those that overlapped restriction enzyme recognition sites and developed four polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays that distinguish alternative allelic states at the tag SNPs. We assessed the performance of these assays using mosquito population samples from Burkina Faso that had been cytogenetically karyotyped as well as genotyped, using two complementary high-throughput molecular methods based on tag SNPs. Further validation was performed using mosquito population samples from additional West African (Benin, Mali, Senegal) and Central African (Cameroon) countries.              Results:                    Of four assays tested, two were concordant with the 2Rc cytogenetic karyotype > 90% of the time in all samples. We recommend that these two assays be employed in tandem for reliable genotyping. By accepting only those genotypic assignments where both assays agree, > 99% of assignments are expected to be accurate.              Conclusions:                    We have developed tandem PCR-RFLP assays for the accurate genotyping of inversion 2Rc in An. coluzzii. Because this approach is simple, inexpensive, and requires only basic molecular biology equipment, it is widely accessible. These provide a crucial tool for probing the molecular basis of eco-phenotypes relevant to malaria epidemiology and vector control.",-1
Alternating Dual-Collision Energy Scanning Mass Spectrometry Approach: Discovery of Novel Microbial Bile-Acid Conjugates,"Bile acids (BAs) are a type of gut microbiota-host cometabolites with abundant structural diversity, and they play critical roles in maintaining host-microbiota homeostasis. In this study, we developed a new N-(4-aminomethylphenyl) pyridinium (AMPP) derivatization-assisted alternating dual-collision energy scanning mass spectrometry (AMPP-dual-CE MS) method for the profiling of BAs derived from host-gut microbiota cometabolism in mice. Using the proposed method, we discovered two new types of amino acid conjugations (alanine conjugation and proline conjugation) and acetyl conjugation with host BAs, for the first time, from mouse intestine contents and feces. Additionally, we also determined and identified nine new leucine- and phenylalanine-conjugated BAs. These findings broaden our knowledge of the composition of the BA pool and provide insight into the mechanism of host-gut microbiota cometabolism of BAs.",-1
Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 controls skin carcinogenesis and psoriasis by shaping the gut microbiota,"Besides promoting inflammation by mobilizing lipid mediators, group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) prevents bacterial infection by degrading bacterial membranes. Here, we show that, despite the restricted intestinal expression of sPLA2-IIA in BALB/c mice, its genetic deletion leads to amelioration of cancer and exacerbation of psoriasis in distal skin. Intestinal expression of sPLA2-IIA is reduced after treatment with antibiotics or under germ-free conditions, suggesting its upregulation by gut microbiota. Metagenome, transcriptome, and metabolome analyses have revealed that sPLA2-IIA deficiency alters the gut microbiota, accompanied by notable changes in the intestinal expression of genes related to immunity and metabolism, as well as in the levels of various blood metabolites and fecal bacterial lipids, suggesting that sPLA2-IIA contributes to shaping of the gut microbiota. The skin phenotypes in Pla2g2a-/- mice are lost (a) when they are cohoused with littermate WT mice, resulting in the mixing of the microbiota between the genotypes, or (b) when they are housed in a more stringent pathogen-free facility, where Pla2g2a expression in WT mice is low and the gut microbial compositions in both genotypes are nearly identical. Thus, our results highlight a potentially new aspect of sPLA2-IIA as a modulator of gut microbiota, perturbation of which affects distal skin responses.",-1
"PD-1/PD-L1, MDSC Pathways, and Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy in Ph(-) Myeloproliferative Neoplasm: A Review","There has been significant progress in immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy in many solid tumor types. However, only a single failed study has been published in treating Ph(-) myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). To make progress in CPI studies on this disease, herein, we review and summarize the mechanisms of activation of the PD-L1 promoter, which are as follows: (a) the extrinsic mechanism, which is activated by interferon gamma (IFN Î³) by tumor infiltration lymphocytes (TIL) and NK cells; (b) the intrinsic mechanism of EGFR or PTEN loss resulting in the activation of the MAPK and AKT pathways and then stat 1 and 3 activation; and (c) 9p24 amplicon amplification, resulting in PD-L1 and Jak2 activation. We also review the literature and postulate that many of the failures of CPI therapy in MPN are likely due to excessive MDSC activities. We list all of the anti-MDSC agents, especially those with ruxolitinib, IMID compounds, and BTK inhibitors, which may be combined with CPI therapy in the future as part of clinical trials applying CPI therapy to Ph(-) MPN.",-1
"Miso (Fermented Soybean Paste) Suppresses Visceral Fat Accumulation in Mice, Especially in Combination with Exercise","We investigated whether the difference in miso consumption between the Japanese diets of 1975 and 2010 has influenced the observed increase in diet-induced obesity. To recreate the 2010 and 1975 Japanese high-fat diets with the corresponding proportions of miso, freeze-dried miso was added to high-fat mouse feed at 1.6% and 2.6%, respectively. When 5-week-old male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were provided each of these diets ad libitum for 8 weeks, it was found that the white adipose tissue weight and adipocyte area were lower in mice receiving the 1975 diet than in those receiving the 2010 diet. Therefore, high miso consumption is one reason why the 1975 Japanese diet tended to not lead to obesity. Next, the combined effects of treadmill exercise and miso consumption were investigated. The mice were divided into three groups, which were provided either a high-fat diet (group C), a high-fat diet with exercise (group C + E), or a miso-supplemented high-fat diet with exercise (group M + E) for 8 weeks. In this experiment, the white adipose tissue weight and adipocyte area in group M + E were lower than in group C. When the mRNA expression of lipid metabolism-associated genes in adipose tissue was measured, we found that expression of Hsl (lipase, hormone sensitive), which is involved in lipolysis, and PparÎ³ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma), which regulates adipocyte differentiation upstream of Hsl, was increased in group M + E. These results clearly demonstrated that lipid accumulation in the adipose tissues is suppressed by miso consumption in combination with exercise.",-1
Systems Nutrology of Adolescents with Divergence between Measured and Perceived Weight Uncovers a Distinctive Profile Defined by Inverse Relationships of Food Consumption,"Changes in food consumption, physical inactivity, and other lifestyle habits are potential causes of the obesity epidemic. Paradoxically, the media promotes idealization of a leaner body appearance. Under these circumstances, self-perception of weight by adolescents may be affected. Here, we performed a cross-sectional study, between June and December 2009, to evaluate the interaction between anthropometric status, perceived body weight, and food consumption profiles in 1496 adolescents from public schools in Salvador, Brazil. Data on socio-epidemiological information, anthropometric status, and dietary patterns were analyzed using multidimensional statistical approaches adapted from systems biology. There were dissimilarities between anthropometric status and perception of body weight related to sex. Four dietary patterns were identified based on the food intake profile in the study participants. The distinct dietary patterns were not influenced by divergence between measured and perceived weight. Moreover, network analysis revealed that overestimation of body weight was characterized by a selectivity in ingestion of food groups that resulted in appearance of inverse correlations of consumption. Thus, misperception of body weight is associated with inverse correlations of consumption of certain food groups. These findings may aid individualized nutritional interventions in adolescents who overestimate body weight.",-1
Establishment of Culex modestus in Belgium and a Glance into the Virome of Belgian Mosquito Species,"Culex modestus mosquitoes are considered potential transmission vectors of West Nile virus and Usutu virus. Their presence has been reported across several European countries, including one larva detected in Belgium in 2018. In this study, mosquitoes were collected in the city of Leuven and surrounding areas in the summers of 2019 and 2020. Species identification was performed based on morphological features and partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The 107 mosquitoes collected in 2019 belonged to eight mosquito species, Culex pipiens (24.3%), Cx. modestus (48.6%), Cx. torrentium (0.9%), Culiseta annulata (0.9%), Culiseta morsitans (0.9%), Aedes sticticus (14.0%), Aedes cinereus (9.3%), and Anopheles plumbeus (0.9%), suggesting the presence of an established Cx. modestus population in Belgium. The collection of Cx. modestus mosquitoes at the same locations in 2020 confirmed their establishment in the region. Haplotype network analysis of the COI sequences for Cx. modestus showed that the Belgian population is rather diverse, suggesting that it may have been established in Belgium for some time. The Belgian Cx. modestus population was most closely related to populations from the United Kingdom and Germany. Characterization of the virome of the collected mosquitoes resulted in the identification of at least 33 eukaryotic viral species. Nine (nearly) complete genomes belonging to 6 viral species were identified, all of which were closely related to known viruses. In conclusion, here, we report the presence of Cx. modestus in the surrounding areas of Leuven, Belgium. As this species is considered to be a vector of several arboviruses, the implementation of vector surveillance programs to monitor this species is recommended.IMPORTANCE Culex modestus mosquitoes are considered to be a potential ""bridge"" vector, being able to transmit pathogens between birds as well as from birds to mammals, including humans. In Belgium, this mosquito species was considered absent until the finding of one larva in 2018 and subsequent evidence of a large population in 2019 to 2020 described here. We collected mosquitoes in the summers of 2019 and 2020 in the city of Leuven and surrounding areas. The mosquito species was identified by morphological and molecular methods, demonstrating the presence of Cx. modestus in this region. The ability of mosquitoes to transmit pathogens can depend on several factors, one of them being their natural virus composition. Therefore, we identified the mosquito-specific viruses harbored by Belgian mosquitoes. As Cx. modestus is able to transmit viruses such as West Nile virus and Usutu virus, the establishment of this mosquito species may increase the risk of virus transmission in the region. It is thus advisable to implement mosquito surveillance programs to monitor this species.",-1
"[Establishment of multiple evidence-integrated evaluation and prediction method for ""toxic"" Chinese medicines]","Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) carries the experience and theoretical knowledge of the ancients, and the use of &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines is a major feature and advantage of TCM. &quot;Toxic&quot; Chinese medicines have unique clinical value and certain medication risk under the guidance of TCM theories such as compatibility for detoxification and treatment based on syndrome differentiation. In recent years, the safety events of Chinese medicines have occurred frequently, which has made the safety of Chinese medicine a public concern in China and abroad. However, limited by conventional cognitive laws and technical methods, basic research on toxicity of Chinese medicines fails to be combined with the clinical application. As a result, it is difficult to identify the clinical characteristics of, predict toxic and side effects of, or form a universal precise medication regimen for &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines, which restricts the clinical application of them. In view of the problem that the toxicity of &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines is difficult to be predicted and restricts the clinical application, the evidence-based research concept will provide new ideas for safe applcation of them in clinical practice. The integrated development of multiple disciplines and techniques in the field of big data and artificial intelligence will also promote the renewal and development of the research models for &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines. Our team tried to propose the academic concept of evidence-based Chinese medicine toxicology and establish the data-intelligence research mode for &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines and the intelligent risk prediction method for medicinal combination in the early stage, which provided methodological supports for solving the above problem. Thus, on the basis of summarizing the research status and problems of the clinical medication regimen of &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines, our team took the evidence-based toxicology of TCM as the core concept, and tried to construct the multiple-evidence integrated evaluation and prediction method for &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicine, so as to guide the establishment of the non-toxic medication regimen of &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines. Specifically, through the analysis of multivariate data obtained from the basic research, the evidence-based toxicology database of Chinese medicines and the individualized &quot;toxicity-effect&quot; intelligent prediction platform were built based on the disease-syndrome virtual patients, so as to identify the clinical characteristics and risks of &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines and develop individualized medication regime. This study is expected to provide a methodological reference for the establishment of medication regimen and risk prevention strategy for &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines. The method established in this study will bridge clinical research and basic research, enhance the transformation of the scientific connotation of attenuated compatibility, promote the development of evidence-based Chinese medicine toxicology, and ensure the clinical safety of &quot;toxic&quot; Chinese medicines.",-1
Adipose tissue oxylipin profiles vary by anatomical site and are altered by dietary linoleic acid in rats,"Dietary PUFA and their effects on adipose tissue have been well studied, but oxylipins, the oxygenated metabolites of PUFA, have been sparsely studied in adipose tissue. To determine the oxylipin profile and to examine their potential importance in various adipose sites, female and male rats were provided control, high linoleic acid (LA), or high LA and high Î±-linolenic acid (LA + ALA) diets for six weeks. Analysis of gonadal (GAT), mesenteric (MAT), perirenal (PAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT) revealed higher numbers of oxylipins in MAT and SAT, primarily due to 20-22 carbon cytochrome P450 oxylipins, as well as metabolites of cyclooxygenase derived oxylipins. LA oxylipins made up 75-96% of the total oxylipin mass and largely determined the total relative amounts between depots (GAT > MAT > PAT > SAT). However, when the two most abundant LA oxylipins (TriHOMEs) were excluded, MAT had the highest mass of oxylipins and exhibited the most sex differences. These differences existed despite comparable PUFA composition between depots. Dietary LA increased oxylipins derived from n-6 PUFA, and the addition of ALA generally returned n-6 PUFA oxylipins to levels similar to control and elevated some n-3 oxylipins. These data on oxylipin profiles in adipose depots from different anatomical sites and the effects of diet and sex provide fundamental knowledge that will aid future studies investigating the physiological effects of adipose tissue.",-1
Sub-lethal aquatic doses of pyriproxyfen may increase pyrethroid resistance in malaria mosquitoes,"Background:                    Pyriproxyfen (PPF), an insect growth hormone mimic is widely used as a larvicide and in some second-generation bed nets, where it is combined with pyrethroids to improve impact. It has also been evaluated as a candidate for auto-dissemination by adult mosquitoes to control Aedes and Anopheles species. We examined whether PPF added to larval habitats of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors can modulate levels of resistance among emergent adult mosquitoes.              Methodology:                    Third-instar larvae of pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles arabiensis (both laboratory-reared and field-collected) were reared in different PPF concentrations, between 1Ã10-9 milligrams active ingredient per litre of water (mgAI/L) and 1Ã10-4 mgAI/L, or no PPF at all. Emergent adults escaping these sub-lethal exposures were tested using WHO-standard susceptibility assays on pyrethroids (0.75% permethrin and 0.05% deltamethrin), carbamates (0.1% bendiocarb) and organochlorides (4% DDT). Biochemical basis of pyrethroid resistance was investigated by pre-exposure to 4% PBO. Bio-efficacies of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, OlysetÂ® and PermaNet 2.0 were also examined against adult mosquitoes with or without previous aquatic exposure to PPF.              Results:                    Addition of sub-lethal doses of PPF to larval habitats of pyrethroid-resistant An. arabiensis, consistently resulted in significantly reduced mortalities of emergent adults when exposed to pyrethroids, but not to bendiocarb or DDT. Mortality rates after exposure to OlysetÂ® nets, but not PermaNet 2.0 were also reduced following aquatic exposures to PPF. Pre-exposure to PBO followed by permethrin or deltamethrin resulted in significant increases in mortality, compared to either insecticide alone.              Conclusions:                    Partially-resistant mosquitoes exposed to sub-lethal aquatic concentrations of PPF may become more resistant to pyrethroids than they already are without such pre-exposures. Studies should be conducted to examine whether field applications of PPF, either by larviciding or other means actually exacerbates pyrethroid-resistance in areas where signs of such resistance already exist in wild the vector populations. The studies should also investigate mechanisms underlying such magnification of resistance, and how this may impact the potential of PPF-based interventions in areas with pyrethroid resistance.",-1
Prediction models for early diagnosis of actinomycotic osteomyelitis of the jaw using machine learning techniques: a preliminary study,"Background:                    This study aimed to develop and validate five machine learning models designed to predict actinomycotic osteomyelitis of the jaw. Furthermore, this study determined the relative importance of the predictive variables for actinomycotic osteomyelitis of the jaw, which are crucial for clinical decision-making.              Methods:                    A total of 222 patients with osteomyelitis of the jaw were analyzed, and Actinomyces were identified in 70 cases (31.5%). Logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and extreme gradient boosting machine learning methods were used to train the models. The models were subsequently validated using testing datasets. These models were compared with each other and also with single predictors, such as age, using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).              Results:                    The AUC of the machine learning models ranged from 0.81 to 0.88. The performance of the machine learning models, such as random forest, support vector machine and extreme gradient boosting was significantly superior to that of single predictors. Presumed causes, antiresorptive agents, age, malignancy, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis were the six features that were identified as relevant predictors.              Conclusions:                    This prediction model would improve the overall patient care by enhancing prognosis counseling and informing treatment decisions for high-risk groups of actinomycotic osteomyelitis of the jaw.",-1
"Phylogenomics Reveals that Asaia Symbionts from Insects Underwent Convergent Genome Reduction, Preserving an Insecticide-Degrading Gene","The mosquito microbiota is composed of several lineages of microorganisms whose ecological roles and evolutionary histories have yet to be investigated in depth. Among these microorganisms, Asaia bacteria play a prominent role, given their abundance in the gut, reproductive organs, and salivary glands of different mosquito species, while their presence has also been reported in several other insects. Notably, Asaia has great potential as a tool for the control of mosquito-borne diseases. Here, we present a wide phylogenomic analysis of Asaia strains isolated from different species of mosquito vectors and from different populations of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, an insect pest of worldwide economic importance. We show that phylogenetically distant lineages of Asaia experienced independent genome reductions, despite following a common pattern, characterized by the early loss of genes involved in genome stability. This result highlights the role of specific metabolic pathways in the symbiotic relationship between Asaia and the insect host. Finally, we discovered that all but one of the Asaia strains included in the study possess the pyrethroid hydrolase gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this gene is ancestral in Asaia, strongly suggesting that it played a role in the establishment of the symbiotic association between these bacteria and the mosquito hosts. We propose that this gene from the symbiont contributed to initial pyrethroid resistance in insects harboring Asaia, also considering the widespread production of pyrethrins by several plants.IMPORTANCE We have studied genome reduction within several strains of the insect symbiont Asaia isolated from different species/strains of mosquito and medfly. Phylogenetically distant strains of Asaia, despite following a common pattern involving the loss of genes related to genome stability, have undergone independent genome reductions, highlighting the peculiar role of specific metabolic pathways in the symbiotic relationship between Asaia and its host. We also show that the pyrethroid hydrolase gene is present in all the Asaia strains isolated except for the South American malaria vector Anopheles darlingi, for which resistance to pyrethroids has never been reported, suggesting a possible involvement of Asaia in determining resistance to insecticides.",-1
Modeling and mapping the habitat suitability and the potential distribution of Arboviruses vectors in Morocco,"Mosquitoes transmit several agents of diseases and the presence of different species represents a threat to animal and public health. Aedes and Culex mosquitoes are of particular concern giving their potential vector competence for Arbovirus transmission. In Morocco, the lack of detailed information related to their spatial distribution raises major concerns and hampers effective vector surveillance and control. Using maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling, we generated prediction models for the potential distribution of Arboviruses vectors (Aedes aegypti, Ae. vexans, Ae. caspius, Ae. detritus, and Culex pipiens) in Morocco, under current climatic conditions. Also, we investigated the habitat suitability for the potential occurrence and establishment of Ae. albopictus and Ae. vittatus recorded only once in the country. Prediction models for these last two species were generated considering occurrence datasets from close countries of the Mediterranean Basin, where Ae. albopictus is well established, and from a worldwide database for the case of Ae. vittatus (model transferability). With the exception of Ae. vittatus, the results identify potential habitat suitability in Morocco for all mosquitos considered. Existing areas with maximum risk of establishment and high potential distribution were mainly located in the northwestern and central parts of Morocco. Our results essentially underline the assumption that Ae. albopictus, if not quickly controlled, might find suitable habitats and has the potential to become established, especially in the northwest of the country. These findings may help to better understand the potential distribution of each species and enhance surveillance efforts in areas identified as high risk.",-1
Two New Alternatives to the Conventional Arm-in-Cage Test for Assessing Topical Repellents,"European guidelines for testing attractant and repellent efficacy (i.e., Product type 19 [PT19]) have been in revision since 2017. A key topic of discussion is the current approach to evaluating topical repellents. The European Chemical Agency has stated field testing should be avoided because of mosquito-borne disease risks. However, the most common laboratory method, the arm-in-cage (AIC) test, may limit the reliable extrapolation of lab results to field conditions. This study's main goal was to assess alternative laboratory methods for evaluating topical mosquito repellents that use mosquito landing rates more representative of those in the field. The study took place at three European testing labs using 30 study participants per test and the mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894, Diptera: Culicidae). In phase 1, a conventional AIC test and a sleeved AIC test were performed. Respectively, the arm area exposed was 600 and 100 cm2, and cage volume was 0.040 and 0.064 m3. Mosquito density was the same for both: 1 female/840 cm3. In phase 2, room-based testing (40 Â± 5 mosquitoes in 25-30 m3) was used as a proxy for field testing. The mosquito repellent employed was 15% N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in ethanol at two doses: 1 and 0.5 g/600 cm2. The protection times measured at each laboratory were analyzed both separately and together using nonparametric (Kruskal-Wallis) test. The two alternatives methods showed to be potential alternatives to the current AIC method recreated field mosquito landing rates and achieved reproducible protection times across laboratories.",-1
The intestinal microbiome is a co-determinant of the postprandial plasma glucose response,"Elevated postprandial plasma glucose is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that the inter-individual postprandial plasma glucose response varies partly depending on the intestinal microbiome composition and function. We analyzed data from Danish adults (n = 106), who were self-reported healthy and attended the baseline visit of two previously reported randomized controlled cross-over trials within the Gut, Grain and Greens project. Plasma glucose concentrations at five time points were measured before and during three hours after a standardized breakfast. Based on these data, we devised machine learning algorithms integrating bio-clinical, as well as shotgun-sequencing-derived taxa and functional potentials of the intestinal microbiome to predict individual postprandial glucose excursions. In this post hoc study, we found microbial and clinical features, which predicted up to 48% of the inter-individual variance of postprandial plasma glucose responses (Pearson correlation coefficient of measured vs. predicted values, R = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.84, p<0.001). The features were age, fasting serum triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, BMI, fasting total serum cholesterol, abundance of Bifidobacterium genus, richness of metagenomics species and abundance of a metagenomic species annotated to Clostridiales at order level. A model based only on microbial features predicted up to 14% of the variance in postprandial plasma glucose excursions (R = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.64, p = 0.04). Adding fasting glycaemic measures to the model including microbial and bio-clinical features increased the predictive power to R = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89, p<0.001), explaining more than 60% of the inter-individual variance of postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. The outcome of the study points to a potential role of the taxa and functional potentials of the intestinal microbiome. If validated in larger studies our findings may be included in future algorithms attempting to develop personalized nutrition, especially for prediction of individual blood glucose excursions in dys-glycaemic individuals.",-1
Downregulation of miR-33a/b and miR-181a contributes to recurrent pregnancy loss by upregulating S1PR1 and repressing regulatory T cell differentiation,"Introduction:                    Successful pregnancy in humans requires adequate maternal-fetal immune tolerance. During regulatory T (Treg) cells play a key role. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P receptor (S1PR) signaling represses Treg cell differentiation, but whether this relates to the process of recurrent pregnancy loss is still unclear.              Methods:                    Treg cells in the placenta were examined using flow cytometry. The expression of sphingosine kinase-1 and -2(SPHK1 and SPHK2), two key kinases controlling S1P production, was detected in placenta samples from 36 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and 40 control participants using immunoblotting. The level of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) in placental T cells was examined using RT-qPCR and immunoblotting. Cell surface S1PR1 levels were detected using flow cytometry. The interactions between miRNAs and S1PR1 mRNA were predicted using bioinformatics tools and were confirmed by dual luciferase assay and immunoblotting.              Results:                    RPL patients had fewer Treg cells (p = 0.034) in the placenta, especially TIM3+ Treg cells (p = 0.0076). S1PR1 protein levels were significantly increased in placental T cells of patients with RPL (p = 0.0065). MiR-33a, miR-33b, and miR-181a were reduced in the placenta from patients with RPL, which were identified to repress S1PR1 expression by targeting the 3'UTR. Knockdown of miR-33a, miR-33b and miR-181a in human naÃ¯ve T cells inhibits Treg cell differentiation by upregulating S1PR1 in vitro.              Discussion:                    This study, for the first time, successfully constructed the correlation between dysregulated miRNAs in placenta and RPL, which partially unveiled the etiology of RPL and provided a therapeutic potential for RPL treatment.",-1
Assessment of therapeutic strategies for management of impulse control disorder in Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    Impulse control disorders (ICD) occur frequently in individuals with Parkinson's disease. So far, prevention is the best treatment. Several strategies for its treatment have been suggested, but their frequency of use and benefit have scarcely been explored.              Objective:                    To investigate which strategy is the most commonly used in a real-life setting and its rate of response.              Methods:                    A longitudinal study was conducted. At the baseline evaluation, data on current treatment and ICD status according to QUIP-RS were collected. The treatment strategies were categorized as ""no-change"", dopamine agonist (DA) dose lowering, DA removal, DA switch or add-on therapy. At the six-month follow-up visit, the same tools were applied.              Results:                    A total of 132 individuals (58.3% men) were included; 18.2% had at least one ICD at baseline. The therapeutic strategy most used in the ICD group was no-change (37.5%), followed by DA removal (16.7%), DA switch (12.5%) and DA lowering (8.3%). Unexpectedly, in 20.8% of the ICD subjects the DA dose was increased. Overall, nearly 80% of the subjects showed remission of their ICD at follow-up.              Conclusions:                    Regardless of the therapy used, most of the subjects presented remission of their ICD at follow-up Further research with a longer follow-up in a larger sample, with assessment of decision-making processes, is required in order to better understand the efficacy of strategies for ICD treatment.",-1
Î²-Glucan-Induced Immuno-Modulation: A Role for the Intestinal Microbiota and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Common Carp,"Dietary supplementation of fish with Î²-glucans has been commonly associated with immunomodulation and generally accepted as beneficial for fish health. However, to date the exact mechanisms of immunomodulation by Î²-glucan supplementation in fish have remained elusive. In mammals, a clear relation between high-fibre diets, such as those including Î²-glucans, and diet-induced immunomodulation via intestinal microbiota and associated metabolites has been observed. In this study, first we describe by 16S rRNA sequencing the active naive microbiota of common carp intestine. Based on the abundance of the genus Bacteroides, well known for their capacity to degrade and ferment carbohydrates, we hypothesize that common carp intestinal microbiota could ferment dietary Î²-glucans. Indeed, two different Î²-glucan preparations (curdlan and MacroGardÂ®) were both fermented in vitro, albeit with distinct fermentation dynamics and distinct production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Second, we describe the potential immunomodulatory effects of the three dominant SCFAs (acetate, butyrate, and propionate) on head kidney leukocytes, showing effects on both nitric oxide production and expression of several cytokines (il-1b, il-6, tnfÎ±, and il-10) in vitro. Interestingly, we also observed a regulation of expression of several gpr40L genes, which were recently described as putative SCFA receptors. Third, we describe how a single in vivo oral gavage of carp with MacroGardÂ® modulated simultaneously, the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes (il-1b, il-6, tnfÎ±), type I IFN-associated genes (tlr3.1, mx3), and three specific gpr40L genes. The in vivo observations provide indirect support to our in vitro data and the possible role of SCFAs in Î²-glucan-induced immunomodulation. We discuss how Î²-glucan-induced immunomodulatory effects can be explained, at least in part, by fermentation of MacroGardÂ® by specific bacteria, part of the naive microbiota of common carp intestine, and how a subsequent production of SFCAs could possibly explain immunomodulation by Î²-glucan via SCFA receptors present on leukocytes.",-1
"Hyperspectral Image Classification: Potentials, Challenges, and Future Directions","Recent imaging science and technology discoveries have considered hyperspectral imagery and remote sensing. The current intelligent technologies, such as support vector machines, sparse representations, active learning, extreme learning machines, transfer learning, and deep learning, are typically based on the learning of the machines. These techniques enrich the processing of such three-dimensional, multiple bands, and high-resolution images with their precision and fidelity. This article presents an extensive survey depicting machine-dependent technologies' contributions and deep learning on landcover classification based on hyperspectral images. The objective of this study is three-fold. First, after reading a large pool of Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, SCI, and SCIE-indexed and SCIE-related articles, we provide a novel approach for review work that is entirely systematic and aids in the inspiration of finding research gaps and developing embedded questions. Second, we emphasize contemporary advances in machine learning (ML) methods for identifying hyperspectral images, with a brief, organized overview and a thorough assessment of the literature involved. Finally, we draw the conclusions to assist researchers in expanding their understanding of the relationship between machine learning and hyperspectral images for future research.",-1
Suppressing leukocyte Kv1.3-channels by commonly used drugs: A novel therapeutic target for schizophrenia?,"Recent studies revealed the involvement of ""chronic inflammation"" in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In schizophrenia and some neurodegenerative disorders that are caused by inflammation, T-lymphocytes and macrophages were hyperactivated or proliferated in the central nervous system, being accompanied by the overexpression of delayed rectifier K+-channels (Kv1.3) within the cells. In our previous basic studies, in addition to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and statins, antibiotics (clarithromycin, chloroquine), anti-hypertensive drugs (nifedipine, benidipine, diltiazem, verapamil) and anti-allergic drugs (cetirizine, fexofenadine, azelastine, terfenadine) strongly suppressed the Kv1.3-channel activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production from lymphocytes. Given such pharmacological properties of these commonly used drugs, they may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, in which the enhanced cellular immunity and the subsequent release of excessive cytokines are responsible for the pathogenesis.",-1
Multiplexed miRNA Quantitation Using Injectionless Microfluidic Thermal Gel Electrophoresis,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of biomolecules that have high clinical and pharmaceutical significance because of their ability to regulate protein expression. Better methods are needed to quantify target miRNAs, but their similar sequence lengths and low concentrations in biomedical samples impede analysis. This report aimed to develop a simple, rapid method to directly quantify multiple miRNAs using microfluidic thermal gel electrophoresis (TGE). Fluorescent probes were designed complementarily in sequence to four target miRNAs that also contained variable DNA overhangs to alter their electrophoretic mobilities. Samples and probes were directly added into thermal gel and loaded throughout a microchannel. Applying voltage resulted in an inline preconcentration and separation of the miRNAs that did not require a sample injection nor user intervention to switch between modes. Baseline resolution was achieved between four double-stranded miRNA-probe hybrids and four excess single-stranded probes. Analytical performance was then improved by designing an innovative microfluidic device with a tapered channel geometry. This device exhibited superior detection limits and separation resolution compared to standard channel devices without increasing the complexity of microfabrication or device operation. A proof-of-concept demonstration was then performed, showing that target miRNAs could be detected from cell extracts. These results demonstrate that TGE provides a simple, inexpensive means of conducting multiplexed miRNA measurements, with the potential for automation to facilitate future clinical and pharmaceutical analyses.",-1
Polymorphisms in Genes Involved in Inflammation and Periodontitis: A Narrative Review,"Current evidence pinpoints that the variability in periodontitis traits in humans may be attributable to genetic factors. Different allelic variants can result in alterations in tissue structure, antibody responses and inflammatory mediators. Consequently, genetic variations may act as protective or risk factors for periodontal diseases. A number of features of the inflammatory and immune response that seem to play a role in the development of periodontitis have a clearly established genetic basis. Identifying genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontitis may be utilized for risk assessment in both aggressive and chronic periodontitis. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the role of polymorphisms in genes involved in inflammation and periodontitis, including cellular receptors, tissue compatibility antigens, antibodies and cytokines.",-1
The Eight Steps of Data Analysis: A Graphical Framework to Promote Sound Statistical Analysis,"Data analysis is a risky endeavor, particularly among people who are unaware of its dangers. According to some researchers, ""statistical conclusions validity"" threatens all research subjected to the dark arts of statistical magic. Although traditional statistics classes may advise against certain practices (e.g., multiple comparisons, small sample sizes, violating normality), they may fail to cover others (e.g., outlier detection and violating linearity). More common, perhaps, is that researchers may fail to remember them. In this article, rather than rehashing old warnings and diatribes against this practice or that, I instead advocate a general statistical-analysis strategy. This graphic-based eight-step strategy promises to resolve the majority of statistical traps researchers may fall into-without having to remember large lists of problematic statistical practices. These steps will assist in preventing both false positives and false negatives and yield critical insights about the data that would have otherwise been missed. I conclude with an applied example that shows how the eight steps reveal interesting insights that would not be detected with standard statistical practices.",-1
Aedes aegypti miRNA-33 modulates permethrin induced toxicity by regulating VGSC transcripts,"Aedes aegypti is a major vector of Zika, dengue, and other arboviruses. Permethrin adulticidal spraying, which targets the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), is commonly done to reduce local mosquito populations and protect humans from exposure to arbovirus pathogens transmitted by this dangerous pest. Permethrin resistance, however, is a growing problem and understanding its underlying molecular basis may identify avenues to combat it. We identified a single G:C polymorphism in pre-miR-33 that was genetically associated with permethrin resistance; resulting isoforms had structural differences that may affect DICER-1/pre-miRNA processing rates. We then assessed the effects of overexpression of pre-miR-33 isoforms on permethrin toxicological phenotypes, VGSC transcript abundance and protein levels for two genetically related mosquito strains. One strain had its naturally high permethrin resistance levels maintained by periodic treatment, and the other was released from selection. VGSC protein levels were lower in the permethrin resistant strain than in the related permethrin-susceptible strain. Overexpression of the G-pre-miR-33 isoform reduced VGSC expression levels in both strains. To further elucidate changes in gene expression associated with permethrin resistance, exome-capture gDNA deep sequencing, genetic association mapping and subsequent gene set enrichment analysis revealed that transport genes, in particular, were selected in resistant versus susceptible mosquitoes. Collectively, these data indicate that miR-33 regulates VGSC expression as part of a nuanced system of neuronal regulation that contributes to a network of heritable features determining permethrin resistance.",-1
Causal associations of circulating adiponectin with cardiometabolic diseases and osteoporotic fracture,"Circulating adiponectin shows some relationships with the occurrence of cardiometabolic diseases and osteoporotic fracture, but little is known about their causal associations. This two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study aims to explore the causal roles of circulating adiponectin in cardiometabolic diseases and osteoporotic fracture. We used 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with circulating adiponectin as the instrumental variables. Inverse variance weighted, weighted median and MR-Egger regression methods were applied to study the causal associations. The results found that high circulating adiponectin was causally associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (beta-estimate: -0.030, 95% CI: -0.048 to -0.011, SE: 0.009, P-value = 0.002) and may be the risk factor of coronary artery disease (beta-estimate: 0.012, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.023, SE: 0.006, P-value = 0.030). No causal associations were seen between circulating adiponectin and other outcomes including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebral ischemia, intracerebral hemorrhage or osteoporotic fracture. This study found the potential causal roles of high circulating adiponectin in reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and increased risk of coronary artery disease, which may help prevent and treat these two diseases.",-1
Intelligent modeling and optimization of titanium surface etching for dental implant application,"Acid-etching is one of the most popular processes for the surface treatment of dental implants. In this paper, acid-etching of commercially pure titanium (cpTi) in a 48% H2SO4 solution is investigated. The etching process time (0-8 h) and solution temperature (25-90 Â°C) are assumed to be the most effective operational conditions to affect the surface roughness parameters such as arithmetical mean deviation of the assessed profile on the surface (Ra) and average of maximum peak to valley height of the surface over considered length profile (Rz), as well as weight loss (WL) of the dental implants in etching process. For the first time, three multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) with two hidden layers was optimized to predict Ra, Rz, and WL. MLP is a feedforward class of ANN and ANN model that involves computations and mathematics which simulate the human-brain processes. The ANN models can properly predict Ra, Rz, and WL variations during etching as a function of process temperature and time. Moreover, WL can be increased to achieve a high Ra. At WL = 0, Ra of 0.5 Î¼m is obtained, whereas Ra increases to 2 Î¼m at WL = 0.78 Î¼g/cm2. Also, ANN model was fed into a nonlinear sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to establish the optimization process and the ability of this method has been proven to predict the optimized etching conditions.",-1
Lentiviral Vectors Expressing Chimeric NEDD4 Ubiquitin Ligases: An Innovative Approach for Interfering with Alpha-Synuclein Accumulation,"One of the main pathological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) is a diffuse accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aS) aggregates in neurons. The NEDD4 E3 Ub ligase promotes aS degradation by the endosomal-lysosomal route. Interestingly, NEDD4, as well as being a small molecule able to trigger its functions, is protective against human aS toxicity in evolutionary distant models. While pharmacological activation of E3 enzymes is not easy to achieve, their flexibility and the lack of ""consensus"" motifs for Ub-conjugation allow the development of engineered Ub-ligases, able to target proteins of interest. We developed lentiviral vectors, encoding well-characterized anti-human aS scFvs fused in frame to the NEDD4 catalytic domain (ubiquibodies), in order to target ubiquitinate aS. We demonstrate that, while all generated ubiquibodies bind to and ubiquitinate aS, the one directed against the non-amyloid component (NAC) of aS (Nac32HECT) affects aS's intracellular levels. Furthermore, Nac32HECT expression partially rescues aS's overexpression or mutation toxicity in neural stem cells. Overall, our data suggest that ubiquibodies, and Nac32HECT in particular, represent a valid platform for interfering with the effects of aS's accumulation and aggregation in neurons.",-1
Advancement of PD Is Reflected by White Matter Changes in Olfactory Areas: A Pilot Study,"Loss of sense of smell is a well-known non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we present insight into the association between PD advancement and equivalents of smell loss in olfactory-eloquent brain areas, such as the posterior cortex and orbitofrontal cortex. Twelve PD patients in different Hoehn and Yahr stages and 12 healthy normosmic individuals were examined with diffusion tensor imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were used to analyze microstructural changes in white matter adjacent to the bilateral posterior and orbitofrontal cortex. Axial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were significantly higher in olfactory ROIs in advanced PD patients. The results of this preliminary study indicate that PD advancement is associated with progressive neurodegeneration in olfactory-related brain areas.",-1
"Genome-Wide Association Study in 3,173 Outbred Rats Identifies Multiple Loci for Body Weight, Adiposity, and Fasting Glucose","Objective:                    Obesity is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Despite the success of human genome-wide association studies, the specific genes that confer obesity remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to use outbred rats to identify the genetic loci underlying obesity and related morphometric and metabolic traits.              Methods:                    This study measured obesity-relevant traits, including body weight, body length, BMI, fasting glucose, and retroperitoneal, epididymal, and parametrial fat pad weight in 3,173 male and female adult N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats across three institutions, providing data for the largest rat genome-wide association study to date. Genetic loci were identified using a linear mixed model to account for the complex family relationships of the HS and using covariates to account for differences among the three phenotyping centers.              Results:                    This study identified 32 independent loci, several of which contained only a single gene (e.g., Epha5, Nrg1, Klhl14) or obvious candidate genes (e.g., Adcy3, Prlhr). There were strong phenotypic and genetic correlations among obesity-related traits, and there was extensive pleiotropy at individual loci.              Conclusions:                    This study demonstrates the utility of HS rats for investigating the genetics of obesity-related traits across institutions and identify several candidate genes for future functional testing.",-1
Transgenic Expression of Human C-Type Lectin Protein CLEC18A Reduces Dengue Virus Type 2 Infectivity in Aedes aegypti,"The C-type lectins, one family of lectins featuring carbohydrate binding domains which participate in a variety of bioprocesses in both humans and mosquitoes, including immune response, are known to target DENV. A human C-type lectin protein CLEC18A in particular shows extensive glycan binding abilities and correlates with type-I interferon expression, making CLEC18A a potential player in innate immune responses to DENV infection; this potential may provide additional regulatory point in improving mosquito immunity. Here, we established for the first time a transgenic Aedes aegypti line that expresses human CLEC18A. This expression enhanced the Toll immune pathway responses to DENV infection. Furthermore, viral genome and virus titers were reduced by 70% in the midgut of transgenic mosquitoes. We found significant changes in the composition of the midgut microbiome in CLEC18A expressing mosquitoes, which may result from the Toll pathway enhancement and contribute to DENV inhibition. Transgenic mosquito lines offer a compelling option for studying DENV pathogenesis, and our analyses indicate that modifying the mosquito immune system via expression of a human immune gene can significantly reduce DENV infection.",-1
Pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of bovine primary myoblasts through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,"Pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes in organismal growth and development. However, its role in muscle function is unclear. This work investigated the roles of PLAG1 in muscle development and explored its regulatory mechanisms. The PLAG1 was proved to promote the proliferation of bovine primary myoblasts using the cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay (P < 0.001), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) proliferation assay (P = 0.005), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (P = 0.028), western blot, and flow cytometry (P < 0.05), and to inhibit apoptosis of bovine primary myoblasts using qRT-PCR (P = 0.038), western blot, and flow cytometry (P < 0.001). Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and western blot showed PLAG1 upregulated phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt, Akt, Cyclin D1, and CDK2 and inhibited the expression of p21 and p27 to enhance myoblast proliferation, and increased expression of Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL to inhibit apoptosis. Additionally, PLAG1 was identified as a target of miR-1 using dual-luciferase assay (P < 0.001), qRT-PCR (P < 0.001), and western blot. Furthermore, miR-1 might be a potential mediator of the positive feedback regulation relationship between PLAG1 and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.",-1
miR-125a attenuates the malignant biological behaviors of cervical squamous cell carcinoma cells through Rad51,"Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the most common cervical malignancy, is more likely to invade and metastasize than other cervical cancers. miR-125a, a tumor suppressor gene, has been confirmed to be associated with cancer metastasis. However, the role of miR-125a in CSCC and the underlying mechanism are unknown. miR-125a expression was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and the Rad51 expression level was measured by western blotting analysis. CSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed with functional assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell assays. Our data confirmed that miR-125a is expressed at low levels in CSCC tissues and cells. Functionally, the overexpression of miR-125a greatly prevented the proliferation, migration and invasion of CSCC cells, and the inhibition of miR-125a expression strongly enhanced these behaviors in CSCC cells. Moreover, the expression of Rad51, a miR-125a target gene, greatly reversed the miR-125-mediated inhibition of CSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we discovered that miR-125a downregulated the levels of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT and mTOR through Rad51 in CSCC cells. miR-125a, a tumor suppressor, can attenuate the malignant behaviors of CSCC cells by targeting Rad51. Therefore, the miR-125a/Rad51 axis might be a target for CSCC therapy.",-1
A comparison between the abdominal and femoral adipose tissue proteome of overweight and obese women,"Body fat distribution is an important determinant of cardiometabolic health. Lower-body adipose tissue (AT) has protective characteristics as compared to upper-body fat, but the underlying depot-differences remain to be elucidated. Here, we compared the proteome and morphology of abdominal and femoral AT. Paired biopsies from abdominal and femoral subcutaneous AT were taken from eight overweight/obese (BMI â?28 kg/m2) women with impaired glucose metabolism after an overnight fast. Proteins were isolated and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and protein expression in abdominal and femoral subcutaneous AT was compared. Moreover, correlations between fat cell size and the proteome of both AT depots were determined. In total, 651 proteins were identified, of which 22 proteins tended to be differentially expressed between abdominal and femoral AT after removal of blood protein signals (p < 0.05). Proteins involved in cell structure organization and energy metabolism were differently expressed between AT depots. Fat cell size, which was higher in femoral AT, was significantly correlated with ADH1B, POSTN and LCP1. These findings suggest that there are only slight differences in protein expression between abdominal and femoral subcutaneous AT. It remains to be determined whether these differences, as well as differences in protein activity, contribute to functional and/or morphological differences between these fat depots.",-1
"Multiple cytochrome P450 genes: conferring high levels of permethrin resistance in mosquitoes, Culex quinquefasciatus","Insecticides, especially pyrethroids, are the most important in the insect pest control and preventing insect vector-borne human diseases. However, insect pests, including mosquitoes, have developed resistance in the insecticides that used against them. Cytochrome P450s are associated with insecticide resistance through overexpression and detoxification mechanisms in insect species. In this study, we utilized a powerful tool, the RNAi technique, to determine the roles of key P450 genes overexpressed in permethrin resistant mosquitoes that confer insecticide resistance to unravel the molecular basis of resistance mechanisms in the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. The results showed that knockdown of 8 key P450 genes using RNAi techniques significantly decreased resistance to permethrin in resistant mosquitoes. In silico modeling and docking analysis further revealed the potential metabolic function of overexpressed P450 genes in the development of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. These findings not only highlighted the functional importance of these P450 genes in insecticide resistance, but also revealed that overexpression of multiple P450 genes was responsible for the high levels of insecticide resistance in a mosquito population of Culex quinquefasciatus.",-1
Understanding what patients think about hospitals: A deep learning approach for detecting emotions in patient opinions,"Introduction:                    Most hospital assessment systems are based on the study of objective statistical variables as well as patient opinions on their experiences with respect to the services offered by each hospital. Nevertheless, studies have indicated that most of these assessment systems fail to detect patient emotions when they are assessing their stays in a hospital. This information is vital to understanding most of the patient reviews, which are very complex and convey several emotions per review. Therefore, this study aimed to address the problem of detecting multiple emotions from patient reviews.              Methods:                    First, a large set of patient opinions was collected from a website that allowed patients to publish their experiences when visiting hospitals. Second, each opinion was labeled with the corresponding conveyed emotions. Third, a deep learning architecture based on a bidirectional gated recurrent unit with a multichannel convolutional neural network layer was proposed to detect multiple emotions from these reviews. Finally, the hyperparameters of this architecture were fine-tuned and different pretrained word embedding models were configured to test its performance.              Results:                    The results confirmed that our proposed method outperformed other deep learning and machine learning-based algorithms and achieved an average accuracy of 95.82%. Furthermore, the experiments show that clinical-domain word embedding slightly outperforms other general-domain word embeddings, although general-domain embeddings are larger in terms of dimensions.              Conclusions:                    The combination of the gated recurrent unit and the multichannel convolutional neural network is able to exploit both semantic and syntactic characteristics of patient opinions. The findings of this study identify research gaps related to areas such as opinion-based hospital recommendations, thereby providing future research directions.",-1
Three important short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) attenuate the inflammatory response induced by 5-FU and maintain the integrity of intestinal mucosal tight junction,"Background:                    5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a used chemotherapy drug for cancer, and its main side effect is intestinal mucositis which causes chemotherapy to fail. It was known that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can inhibit immune cell release of various proinflammatory factors and inhibit excessive intestinal inflammation. However, the inhibitory effect of SCFAs on 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis is still unclear.              Results:                    To simulate the effects of SCFAs on immune and intestinal epithelial cells, the cells (THP-1 cells and Caco-2 cells) were pretreated with sodium acetate (NaAc), sodium propionate (NaPc) and sodium butyrate (NaB), then inflammation was induced by 5-FU. The expressions of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Beclin-1, LC3-II, NF-ÎºB p65, NLRP3 inflammasome, proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines and mucosal tight junction proteins were determined. In our results, the three SCFAs could inhibit ROS expressions, NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-18, Beclin-1 and LC3-II, when induced by 5-FU. In a 5-FU-induced chemoentermuctis mouse model, Lactobacillus rhamnoides can increase the concentrations of three SCFAs in faeces and increase the concentrations of IL-1Î², IL-6 and IgA in serum, and decrease the expressions of NLRP3 and IL-17 in spleen cells. The expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin in intestinal mucosa were significantly increased.              Conclusions:                    These results indicated that the three SCFAs can effectively suppress the inflammation of THP-1 cells and Caco-2 cells and maintain tight junction integrity in intestinal mucosal epithelial cells.",-1
Exosome-Mediated Transfer of miR-1323 from Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Confers Radioresistance of C33A Cells by Targeting PABPN1 and Activating Wnt/Î²-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Cervical Cancer,"Plenty of pieces of evidence suggest that the resistance to radiotherapy greatly influences the therapeutic effect in cervical cancer (CCa). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate cellular processes by acting as tumor suppressors or promoters, thereby driving radioresistance or radiosensitivity. Meanwhile, it has been reported that microRNA-1323 (miR-1323) widely participates in cancer progression and radiotherapy effects. However, the role of miR-1323 is still not clear in CCa. Hence, in this study, we are going to investigate the molecular mechanism of miR-1323 in CCa cells. In the beginning, miR-1323 was found aberrantly upregulated in CCa cells via RT-qPCR assay. Functional assays indicated that miR-1323 was transferred by cancer-associated fibroblasts-secreted (CAFs-secreted) exosomes and miR-1323 downregulation suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and increased cell radiosensitivity in CCa. Mechanism assays demonstrated that miR-1323 targeted poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). Besides, PABPN1 recruited insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) to regulate glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3Î²) and influenced Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, rescue experiments were implemented to validate that PABPN1 overexpression rescued the inhibited cancer development and radioresistance induced by the miR-1323 inhibitor. In conclusion, miR-1323 was involved in CCa progression and radioresistance which might provide a novel insight for CCa treatment.",-1
Defining the Role of Isoeugenol from Ocimum tenuiflorum against Diabetes Mellitus-Linked Alzheimer's Disease through Network Pharmacology and Computational Methods,"The present study involves the integrated network pharmacology and phytoinformatics-based investigation of phytocompounds from Ocimum tenuiflorum against diabetes mellitus-linked Alzheimer's disease. It aims to investigate the mechanism of the Ocimum tenuiflorum phytocompounds in the amelioration of diabetes mellitus-linked Alzheimer's disease through network pharmacology, druglikeness and pharmacokinetics, molecular docking simulations, GO analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy analyses. A total of 14 predicted genes of the 26 orally bioactive compounds were identified. Among these 14 genes, GAPDH and AKT1 were the most significant. The network analysis revealed the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway to be a prominent pathway linked to GAPDH with 50.53% probability. Upon the molecular docking simulation with GAPDH, isoeugenol was found to possess the most significant binding affinity (-6.0 kcal/mol). The molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation results also predicted that isoeugenol forms a stable protein-ligand complex with GAPDH, where the phytocompound is predicted to chiefly use van der Waal's binding energy (-159.277 kj/mol). On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that isoeugenol from Ocimum tenuiflorum could be taken for further in vitro and in vivo analysis, targeting GAPDH inhibition for the amelioration of diabetes mellitus-linked Alzheimer's disease.",-1
What do young people who self-harm find helpful? A comparative study of young people with and without experience of being looked after in care,"Background:                    Self-harm amongst young people is an increasing problem, with looked-after young people at higher risk. Despite this, little research exists on what young people who self-harm find helpful.              Method:                    One hundred and twenty-six 11-21 year olds (53 who had experience of the care system and 73 who did not) were recruited from the community and NHS. All participants had self-harmed in the past 6 months. Participants completed an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-interview (ACASI) regarding their views about the support they had received, how helpful it was, and what further help they felt they needed.              Results:                    Looked-after young people reported the three most helpful sources of support were Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), friends and pets and the least helpful were CAMHS, Accident and Emergency (A&E) and Social services. For non-looked-after young people, CAMHS, counselling and Harmless (user-led support service for self-harm) were most helpful and CAMHS, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and general practitioner (GP) were the least. Compared with the other group, more looked-after young people had received help from A&E and CAMHS, whereas more non-looked-after young people had accessed GPs, parents, psychological therapies, self-help books and websites. More looked-after young people found support groups helpful, and more non-looked-after young people reported that distraction techniques, medication and their siblings were helpful.              Conclusion:                    Young people who self-harm have mixed views about CAMHS. Differences in the pattern of access and preferences for support between looked-after and non-looked-after young people should be reflected in service availability and commissioning.              Key practitioner message:                    Little is known about what young people who self-harm find helpful, particularly for looked-after young people. CAMHS was named amongst the most helpful and the least helpful services by both looked-after and non-looked-after young people. Social services and A&E were frequently cited amongst the least helpful sources of support. Young people report finding informal support helpful, including family and friends. There appears to be a need for explorations of the reasons behind the apparent negative perception of statutory services in young people, and what is required to shift that.",-1
Video Representation of Dopamine-Responsive Multiple System Atrophy Cerebellar Type,"BACKGROUND Multiple system atrophy cerebellar type (MSA-C) is a subtype of MSA that presents with predominant ataxia along with lesser signs of parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction. Previous studies have shown benefits from carbidopa/levodopa therapy for the MSA parkinsonian subtype but few studies have focused on the MSA-C subtype. We present a video case of MSA-C that demonstrated significant improvement with carbidopa/levodopa therapy. CASE REPORT A right-handed 61-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic microvascular ischemia, mild lower extremity neuropathy, and lumbar and cervical stenosis status after decompression presented with progressive worsening gait changes over several months with acute deterioration before admission. The initial neurological workup demonstrated bilateral cogwheel rigidity; difficulty with movement initiation. including standing up from a seated position; slow saccadic eye movements; masked facies (hypomimia); right ankle clonus; bilateral upper and left lower limb ataxia; and hyperreflexia. A follow-up workup was negative for metabolic, infectious, and paraneoplastic causes, but magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated cerebellar atrophy along with a ""hot cross bun sign"" suggestive of probable MSA-C according to consensus criteria, and the patient was started on carbidopa-levodopa. He subsequently demonstrated improvement in key motor domains, including his cogwheel rigidity and gait testing, and was discharged shortly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS Through this case report, we highlight a significant response to L-dopa therapy beyond what is normally expected according to diagnostic criteria for MSA. MSA treatment responsiveness can vary significantly across patients, which warrants additional studies into appropriate treatment choices for patients with Parkinson's disease and MSA.",-1
hsa-miR-206b Involves in the Development of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma via Targeting LMX1B,"Objectives:                    Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common endocrine system malignant thyroid cancer, and patients with lymph node metastasis typically exhibit poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in PTC. This study was aimed at using PTC transcriptome data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify differentially expressed, survival-related miRNAs and target genes.              Methods:                    We analyzed the TCGA datasets to identify differentially expressed mRNAs/miRNAs in 493 PTC patients with stage I_II group (stages I and II) versus stage III_IV group (stages III and IV) according to TNM staging. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the Cox regression analysis, and the log-rank test were performed to investigate survival-related miRNAs.              Results:                    We identified 36 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in the stage I_II group versus the stage III_IV group, in which 31 were upregulated and only 5 were downregulated (i.e., hsa-miR-891a-5p, hsa-miR-892a, hsa-miR-888-5p, hsa-miR-891b, and hsa-miR-892b). Additionally, five signature miRNAs (hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-299-3p, hsa-miR-299-5p, hsa-miR-496, and hsa-miR-509-3-5p) were associated with the overall survival of PTC patients. We also found that LMX1B, whose expression was inversely correlated with hsa-miR-206 expression, was a putative target gene of hsa-miR-206 and LMX1B was likely to serve as a tumor suppressor in PTC.              Conclusion:                    hsa-miR-206b might be involved in promoting TNM staging in PTC via targeting of LMX1B.",-1
Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene variants in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort with Parkinson's disease: mutational spectrum and clinical features,"GBA variants are associated with increased risk and earlier onset of Parkinson's disease (PD), and more rapid disease progression especially with ""severe"" variants typified by p.L483P. GBA mutation screening studies from South-East Asia, with > 650 million inhabitants of diverse ancestries, are very limited. We investigated the spectrum of GBA variants, and associated clinico-demographic features, in a multi-ethnic PD cohort in Malaysia. Patients (n = 496) were recruited from seven centres, primarily of Chinese (45%), Malay (37%), and Indian (13%) ethnicities. All GBA coding exons were screened using a next-generation sequencing-based PD gene panel and verified with Sanger sequencing. We identified 14 heterozygous GBA alleles consisting of altogether 17 missense variants (8 classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for PD) in 25 (5.0%) patients, with a substantially higher yield among early (< 50 years) vs. late-onset patients across all three ethnicities (9.1-13.2% vs. 1.0-3.2%). The most common variant was p.L483P (including RecNciI, n = 11, 2.2%), detected in all three ethnicities. Three novel variants/recombinant alleles of uncertain significance were found; p.P71L, p.L411P, and p.L15S(;)S16G(;)I20V. The common European risk variants, p.E365K, p.T408M, and p.N409S, were not detected. A severe disease course was noted in the majority of GBA-variant carriers, across a range of detected variants. We report a potentially novel observation of spine posture abnormalities in GBA-variant carriers. This represents the largest study on GBA variation from South-East Asia, and highlights that these populations, especially those with EOPD, would be relevant for studies including clinical trials targeting GBA pathways.",-1
Cross-sectional and Prospective Associations of Rest-Activity Rhythms With Metabolic Markers and Type 2 Diabetes in Older Men,"Objective:                    Disruption of rest-activity rhythms is cross-sectionally associated with metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, yet it remains unclear whether it predicts impaired glucose metabolism and homeostasis. The aim of this study is to examine the cross-sectional and prospective associations between rest-activity rhythm characteristics and glycemic measures in a cohort of older men.              Research design and methods:                    Baseline rest-activity rhythms were derived from actigraphy with use of extended cosine model analysis. With subjects fasting, glucose, insulin, and HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured from blood at baseline and after â?.5 years. Type 2 diabetes was defined based on self-report, medication use, and fasting glucose.              Results:                    In the cross-sectional analysis (n = 2,450), lower 24-h amplitude-to-mesor ratio (i.e., mean activity-adjusted rhythm amplitude) and reduced overall rhythmicity were associated with higher fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (all P trend < 0.0001), indicating increased insulin resistance. The odds of baseline type 2 diabetes were significantly higher among those in the lowest quartile of amplitude (Q1) (odds ratio [OR]Q1 vs. Q4 1.63 [95% CI 1.14, 2.30]) and late acrophase group (ORlate vs. normal 1.46 [95% CI 1.04, 2.04]). In the prospective analysis (n = 861), multiple rest-activity characteristics predicted a two- to threefold increase in type 2 diabetes risk, including a lower amplitude (ORQ1 vs. Q4 3.81 [95% CI 1.45, 10.00]) and amplitude-to-mesor ratio (OR 2.79 [95% CI 1.10, 7.07]), reduced overall rhythmicity (OR 3.49 [95% CI 1.34, 9.10]), and a late acrophase (OR 2.44 [1.09, 5.47]).              Conclusions:                    Rest-activity rhythm characteristics are associated with impaired glycemic metabolism and homeostasis and higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes.",-1
Adaptive comparison matrix: An efficient method for psychological scaling of large stimulus sets,"Studies on natural and social vision often need to quantify subjective intensity along a particular dimension for a large number of stimuli whose perceptual ordering is unknown. Here, we introduce an easy experimental protocol of comparative judgments that can rank and scale subjective stimulus intensity using a comparatively small number of trials. On each trial in our protocol, the observer initially views M stimuli sampled from a space of N stimuli and selects the stimulus that elicits maximum subjective response along a given dimension (e.g., the most attractive). The selected stimulus is subsequently discarded, the observer then performs a judgment on the remaining stimuli, and the process is iterated until the last stimulus remains and a new trial begins. The method relies on sorting perceived stimulus order in the N x N comparison matrix via logistic regression and sampling the next set of M stimuli such that responses will be collected only for stimulus pairs whose expected response ratio is most informative. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this method can estimate psychological scale with a small number of responses. Psychophysical experiments confirm that the method can quickly estimate the contrast response function for gratings and the perceived glossiness of naturalistic objects. This protocol would be useful for characterizing human judgments along various dimensions, especially those with no physical image correlates such as emotional and social attributes.",-1
Animal models for assessing impact of C-section delivery on biological systems,"There has been a significant increase in Caesarean section (C-section) births worldwide over the past two decades and although it can be a life-saving procedure, the enduring effects on host physiology are now undergoing further scrutiny. Indeed, epidemiological data have linked C-section birth with multiple immune, metabolic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Birth by C-section is known to alter the colonisation of the neonatal gut microbiota (with C-section delivered infants lacking vaginal microbiota associated with passing along the birth canal), which in turn can impact the development and maintenance of many important biological systems. Appropriate animal models are key to disentangling the role of missing microbes in brain health and disease in C-section births. In this review of preclinical studies, we interrogate the effects of C-section birth on the development (and maintenance) of several biological systems and we discuss the involvement of the gut microbiome on C-section-related alterations.",-1
"Accelerated Generation of Extra-Islet Insulin-Producing Cells in Diabetic Rats, Treated with Sodium Phthalhydrazide","Î²-cells dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), partially may be compensated by the generation of extra-islet insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in pancreatic acini and ducts. Pdx1 expression and inflammatory level are suggested to be involved in the generation of extra-islet IPCs, but the exact reasons and mechanisms of it are unclear. Macrophages are key inflammatory mediators in T2D. We studied changes in mass and characteristics of extra-islet IPCs in rats with a streptozotocin-nicotinamide model of T2D and after i.m. administration of 20 daily doses of 2 mg/kg b.w. sodium aminophthalhydrazide (APH). Previously, we found that APH modulates macrophage production and increases the proliferative activity of pancreatic Î²-cells. Expressions of insulin and Pdx1, as well as F4/80 (macrophage marker), were detected at the protein level by immunohistochemistry analysis, the concentration of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in blood and pancreas-by ELISA. Diabetic rats treated with APH showed an increasing mass of extra-islet IPCs and the content of insulin in them. The presence of Pdx1+ cells in the exocrine pancreas also increased. F4/80+ cell reduction was accompanied by increasing TGF-Î²1 content. Interestingly, during the development of diabetes, the mass of Î²-cells decreased faster than the mass of extra-islet IPCs, and extra-islet IPCs reacted to experimental T2D differently depending on their acinar or ductal location.",-1
Ectopic fat and aerobic fitness are key determinants of glucose homeostasis in nonobese Asians,"Background:                    The importance of ectopic fat deposition and physical fitness in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction in subjects from the nonobese Asians is not known.              Materials and methods:                    We conducted a cross-sectional study and measured insulin sensitivity (M value; 4-hour hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp), insulin secretion rate (3-hour mixed meal tolerance test with oral minimal modelling), percent body fat, visceral adipose tissue, intramyocellular and intrahepatic lipid contents (magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy), cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 max; graded exercise test) and habitual physical activity (short International Physical Activity Questionnaire) in 60 healthy nonobese Asian subjects (BMI = 21.9 Â± 1.7 kg/m2 , age = 41.8 Â± 13.4 years).              Results:                    M was inversely associated with percent body fat (r = -0.460, P < 0.001), visceral fat (r = -0.623, P < 0.001) and liver fat (r = -0.601, P < 0.001), whereas insulin secretion correlated positively with these adiposity indices (percent body fat: r = 0.303, P = 0.018; visceral fat: r = 0.409, P = 0.010; hepatic fat: r = 0.393, P = 0.002). VO2 max correlated negatively with insulin secretion rate (r = -0.420, P < 0.001) and positively with M (r = 0.658, P < 0.001). The amount of vigorous physical activity was positively associated with VO2 max (r = 0.682, P < 0.001). Multiple stepwise linear regression analyses indicated that VO2 max, age, and IHTG or VAT were independent determinants of insulin sensitivity and secretion (adjusted R2 = 69% and 33%, respectively, P < 0.001).              Conclusions:                    Increased ectopic fat deposition is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and increased insulin secretion in healthy nonobese Asians. Poor cardiorespiratory fitness, likely due to inadequate participation in vigorous exercise, is strongly related to suboptimal metabolic function. Interventions to encourage engagement in physical activity may thus be important for improving metabolic health in nonobese Asians.",-1
Circular RNA Profiling Identifies Novel circPPARA that Promotes Intramuscular Fat Deposition in Pigs,"Intramuscular fat (IMF) content plays an important role in pork quality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) implicate various biological processes; however, the regulatory mechanisms and functions of circRNAs in porcine IMF remains elusive. Hence, the study assessed the circRNA expression profiling in the longissimus dorsi muscle of pigs with high (H) and low (L) IMF content to unravel their regulatory functions in improving meat quality. The RNA sequencing analysis identified 29,732 circRNAs from six sampled pigs, most of which were exon-derived. In the muscle, 336 were differentially expressed (DE) between the H and L IMF groups; 196 circRNAs were upregulated, and 140 were downregulated. Subsequent qRT-PCR validation of 10 DE circRNAs revealed expression patterns consistent with the RNA-seq data. Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that most significantly enriched DE circRNAs' host genes were linked to lipid metabolism and adipogenesis processes. The circRNA-miRNA regulatory network analysis found several circRNAs targeting miRNAs associated with adipogenesis. Finally, a novel circRNA, circPPARA, was identified with the expression positively correlated with the IMF content. Detailed analysis revealed that circPPARA was formed via head-to-tail splicing and was more stable than the linear PPARA, predominantly located in the cytoplasm. Functional studies using overexpression and siRNA constructs demonstrated that circPPARA promotes differentiation and hinders the proliferation of porcine intramuscular preadipocytes. Moreover, the dual-luciferase assay revealed that circPPARA adsorbed miR-429 and miR-200b, thereby promoting intramuscular adipogenesis in pigs. Our results identified a candidate circRNA, circPPARA, that affects porcine IMF content. The study provides knowledge of the regulatory functions of circRNAs in intramuscular adipogenesis and abundant resource for future research on circRNAs in pigs.",-1
Hen raising helps chicks establish gut microbiota in their early life and improve microbiota stability after H9N2 challenge,"Background:                    Early gut microbial colonization is important for postnatal growth and immune development of the chicken. However, at present, commercial chickens are hatched and raised without adult hens, thus are cut off from the microbiota transfer between hens and chicks. In this study, we compared the gut microbiota composition between hen-reared and separately reared chicks, and its impact on the resistance to H9N2 avian influenza virus, with the motive of investigating the impact of this cutoff in microbiota transfer.              Results:                    We used the 16SrRNA sequencing method to assess the composition of the gut microbiota in chicks represented by three hen-reared groups and one separately reared group. We found that the diversity of gut microbes in the chicks from the three hen-reared groups was more abundant than in the separately reared group, both at the phylum and genus levels. Our findings highlight the importance of early parental care in influencing the establishment of gut microbiota in the early life of chicks. SourceTracker analysis showed that the feather and cloaca microbiota of hens are the main sources of gut microbiota of chicks. After H9N2 exposure, the viral infection lasted longer in the separately reared chicks, with the viral titers in their oropharyngeal swabs being higher compared to the hen-reared chicks at day 5 post-infection. Interestingly, our results revealed that the gut microbiota of the hen-reared chicks was more stable after H9N2 infection in comparison to that of the separately reared chicks.              Conclusions:                    Microbiota transfer between the hens and their chicks promotes the establishment of a balanced and diverse microbiota in the early life of the chicks and improves microbiota stability after H9N2 challenge. These findings advance our understanding of the protective role of gut microbiota in the early life of chicks and should be instrumental in improving chick rearing in the commercial poultry industry.

"Metagenomic sequencing reveals viral abundance and diversity in mosquitoes from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, China","Background:                    Mosquitoes host and transmit numerous arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that cause disease in both humans and animals. Effective surveillance of virome profiles in mosquitoes is vital to the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases in northwestern China, where epidemics occur frequently.              Methods:                    Mosquitoes were collected in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region (Shaanxi Province, Gansu Province, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region) of China from June to August 2019. Morphological methods were used for taxonomic identification of mosquito species. High-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis were used to characterize mosquito viromes.              Results:                    A total of 22,959 mosquitoes were collected, including Culex pipiens (45.7%), Culex tritaeniorhynchus (40.6%), Anopheles sinensis (8.4%), Aedes (5.2%), and Armigeres subalbatus (0.1%). In total, 3,014,183 (0.95% of clean reads) viral sequences were identified and assigned to 116 viral species (including pathogens such as Japanese encephalitis virus and Getah virus) in 31 viral families, including Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Phasmaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and some unclassified viruses. Mosquitoes collected in July (86 species in 26 families) showed greater viral diversity than those from June and August. Culex pipiens (69 species in 25 families) and Culex tritaeniorhynchus (73 species in 24 families) carried more viral species than Anopheles sinensis (50 species in 19 families) or Aedes (38 species in 20 families) mosquitoes.              Conclusion:                    Viral diversity and abundance were affected by mosquito species and collection time. The present study elucidates the virome compositions of various mosquito species in northwestern China, improving the understanding of virus transmission dynamics for comparison with those of disease outbreaks.",-1
Effect of prior antibiotic or chemotherapy treatment on immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer,"Background:                    Treatment outcomes of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have substantially improved with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), although only approximately 19% of patients respond to immunotherapy alone, increasing to 58% with the addition of chemotherapy. The gut microbiome has been recognized as a modulator of ICI response via its priming effect on the host immune response. Antibiotics as well as chemotherapy reduce gut microbial diversity, hence altering composition and function of the gut microbiome. Since the gut microbiome may modify ICI efficacy, we conducted a retrospective study evaluating the effects of prior antibiotic or chemotherapy use on NSCLC patient response to ICI.              Methods:                    We retrospectively evaluated 256 NSCLC patients treated between 2011-2017 at Moffitt Cancer Center with ICI Â± chemotherapy, examining the associations between prior antibiotic or chemotherapy use, overall response rate and survival. Relative risk regression using a log-link with combinatorial expectation maximization algorithm was performed to analyze differences in response between patients treated with antibiotics or chemotherapy versus patients who didn't receive antibiotics or chemotherapy. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to evaluate associations between risk factors and overall survival.              Results:                    Only 46 (18% of 256) patients used antibiotics prior to and/or during ICI treatment, and 146 (57%) had prior chemotherapy. Antibiotic users were 8% more likely to have worse overall response rate (RR:1.08; CI:0.93-1.26; p = 0.321), as well as a 35% worse overall survival (HR:1.35; CI:0.91-2.02; p = 0.145), although results were not statistically significant. However, prior use of chemotherapy was significantly associated with poor ICI response (RR:1.24; CI:1.05-1.47; p = 0.013) and worse overall survival (HR:1.47; CI:1.07-2.03; p = 0.018).              Conclusions:                    Patients receiving antibiotics prior to and/or during ICI therapy might experience worse treatment outcomes and survival than unexposed patients, although these associations were not statistically significant and hence warrant further prospective study. Prior chemotherapy significantly reduced ICI response and overall survival. Antibiotic or chemotherapy exposure may negatively impact ICI response, perhaps through disruption of the eubiotic gut microbiome.",-1
Assessment of West Nile Virus Lineage 2 Dynamics in Greece and Future Implications,"The emergence of West Nile Virus lineage 2 (WNV-2) has contributed to multiple major human outbreaks in Greece since 2010. Studies to date investigating biological and environmental factors that contribute to West Nile Virus (WNV) transmission have resulted in complex statistical models. We sought to examine open publicly available data to ascertain if a predictive risk assessment could be employed for WNV-2 in Greece. Based on accessible data, factors such as precipitation, temperature, and range of avian host species did not yield conclusive outcomes. However, by measuring the average rate of temperature change leading up to peak caseloads, we found a predictive characteristic to the timing of outbreaks. Detailed evolutionary studies revealed possible multiple introductions of WNV-2 in Europe, and that Greece acts through a source-sink inversion model, thereby allowing continued reseeding of WNV transmission each year by overwintering the Culex pipiens mosquito vector. Greece has proven an excellent model in WNV surveillance and has demonstrated the importance of rapid reporting for proper preparedness and response to vector-borne diseases.",-1
BiP Heterozigosity Aggravates Pathological Deterioration in Experimental Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,"In the present study, we investigated the involvement of the chaperone protein BiP (also known as GRP78 or Hspa5), a master regulator of intracellular proteostasis, in two mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). To this end, we used mice bearing partial genetic deletion of the BiP gene (BiP+/- mice), which, for the ALS model, were crossed with mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) transgenic mice to generate mSOD1/BiP+/- double mutant mice. Our data revealed a more intense neurological decline in the double mutants, reflected in a greater deterioration of the neurological score and rotarod performance, with also a reduced animal survival, compared to mSOD1 transgenic mice. Such worsening was associated with higher microglial (labelled with Iba-1 immunostaining) and, to a lesser extent, astroglial (labelled with GFAP immunostaining) immunoreactivities found in the double mutants, but not with a higher loss of spinal motor neurons (labelled with Nissl staining) in the spinal cord. The morphological analysis of Iba-1 and GFAP-positive cells revealed a higher presence of activated cells, characterized by elevated cell body size and shorter processes, in double mutants compared to mSOD1 mice with normal BiP expression. In the case of the PD model, BiP+/- mice were unilaterally lesioned with the parkinsonian neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In this case, however, we did not detect a greater susceptibility to damage in mutant mice, as the motor defects caused by 6-OHDA in the pole test and the cylinder rearing test, as well as the losses in tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons and the elevated glial reactivity (labelled with CD68 and GFAP immunostaining) detected in the substantia nigra were of similar magnitude in BiP+/- mice compared with wildtype animals. Therefore, our findings support the view that a dysregulation of the protein BiP may contribute to ALS pathogenesis. As BiP has been recently related to cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor function, our work also opens the door to future studies on a possible link between BiP and the neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids that have been widely reported in this neuropathological context. In support of this possibility, preliminary data indicate that CB1 receptor levels are significantly reduced in mSOD1 mice having partial deletion of BiP gene.",-1
"Bioacoustics in cognitive research: Applications, considerations, and recommendations","The multifaceted ability to produce, transmit, receive, and respond to acoustic signals is widespread in animals and forms the basis of the interdisciplinary science of bioacoustics. Bioacoustics research methods, including sound recording and playback experiments, are applicable in cognitive research that centers around the processing of information from the acoustic environment. We provide an overview of bioacoustics techniques in the context of cognitive studies and make the case for the importance of bioacoustics in the study of cognition by outlining some of the major cognitive processes in which acoustic signals are involved. We also describe key considerations associated with the recording of sound and its use in cognitive applications. Based on these considerations, we provide a set of recommendations for best practices in the recording and use of acoustic signals in cognitive studies. Our aim is to demonstrate that acoustic recordings and stimuli are valuable tools for cognitive researchers when used appropriately. In doing so, we hope to stimulate opportunities for innovative cognitive research that incorporates robust recording protocols.

"Association of early-onset diabetes, prediabetes and early glycaemic recovery with the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality","Aims/hypothesis:                    The increasing incidence of diabetes among young adults is a disease burden; however, the effects of early-onset diabetes, prediabetes and glycaemic recovery on CVD or mortality remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of these factors with 10 year all-cause mortality, CVD mortality and CVD incidence in Korean young adults.              Methods:                    This large and longitudinal cohort study included data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Information Database; 2,502,375 young adults aged 20-39 years without diabetes mellitus and CVD at baseline were included. Glycaemic status was measured twice, first in 2002-2003 and second in 2004-2005. Changes in fasting glucose levels were evaluated according to fasting glucose status: normal fasting glucose (NFG; <5.5 mmol/l), impaired fasting glucose (IFG; 5.5-6.9 mmol/l), and diabetic fasting glucose (DFG; â?.0 mmol/l). Primary outcomes were all-cause and CVD mortality risk. The secondary outcome was incidence of CVD, including acute myocardial infarction and stroke. All outcomes arose from the 10 year follow-up period 1 Jan 2006 to 31 December 2015.              Results:                    Individuals with NFG at baseline, who were subsequently newly diagnosed with diabetes and prediabetes (IFG), had increased all-cause mortality (HR [95% CI] 1.60 [1.44, 1.78] and 1.13 [1.09, 1.18], respectively) and CVD incidence (1.13 [1.05, 1.23] and 1.04 [1.01, 1.07], respectively). In those with DFG at baseline, early recovery to NFG and IFG was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (0.57 [0.46, 0.70] and 0.65 [0.53, 0.81], respectively) and CVD incidence (0.70 [0.60, 0.81] and 0.78 [0.66, 0.91], respectively). Among patients with IFG at baseline, early recovery to NFG was associated with decreased CVD mortality (0.74 [0.59, 0.93]).              Conclusions/interpretation:                    Early-onset diabetes or prediabetes increased CVD risks and all-cause mortality after the 10 year follow-up. Furthermore, recovery of hyperglycaemia could reduce the subsequent 10 year risk for CVD incidence and all-cause mortality. Graphical abstract.",-1
Targeting HIF1-alpha/miR-326/ITGA5 axis potentiates chemotherapy response in triple-negative breast cancer,"Purpose:                    Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer that is frequently treated with chemotherapy. However, many patients exhibit either de novo chemoresistance or ultimately develop resistance to chemotherapy, leading to significantly high mortality rates. Therefore, increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy has potential to improve patient outcomes.              Methods:                    Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing (both RNA and small RNA-sequencing), coupled with network simulations and patient survival data analyses to build a novel miRNA-mRNA interaction network governing chemoresistance in TNBC. We performed cell proliferation assay, Western blotting, RNAi/miRNA mimic experiments, FN coating, 3D cultures, and ChIP assays to validate the interactions in the network, and their functional roles in chemoresistance. We developed xenograft models to test the therapeutic potential of the identified key miRNA/proteins in potentiating chemoresponse in vivo. We also analyzed several patient datasets to evaluate the clinical relevance of our findings.              Results:                    We identified fibronectin (FN1) as a central chemoresistance driver gene. Overexpressing miR-326 reversed FN1-driven chemoresistance by targeting FN1 receptor, ITGA5. miR-326 was downregulated by increased hypoxia/HIF1A and ECM stiffness in chemoresistant tumors, leading to upregulation of ITGA5 and activation of the downstream FAK/Src signaling pathways. Overexpression of miR-326 or inhibition of ITGA5 overcame FN1-driven chemotherapy resistance in vitro by inhibiting FAK/Src pathway and potentiated the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. Importantly, lower expression of miR-326 or higher levels of predicted miR-326 target genes was significantly associated with worse overall survival in chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients.              Conclusion:                    FN1 is central in chemoresistance. In chemoresistant tumors, hypoxia and resulting ECM stiffness repress the expression of the tumor suppressor miRNA, miR-326. Hence, re-expression of miR-326 or inhibition of its target ITGA5 reverses FN1-driven chemoresistance making them attractive therapeutic approaches to enhance chemotherapy response in TNBCs.",-1
A severe case of human rhinovirus A45 with central nervous system involvement and viral sepsis,"Background:                    Rhinovirus is a common viral aetiology of upper respiratory infection and is mostly associated with common cold or flu-like illness. Although rhinovirus has been recognized as a pathogen for lower respiratory infections in severe cases credited to advances in molecular detection, central nervous system involvement and multiorgan dysfunction are extremely rare.              Case presentation:                    A previously healthy 10-year-old girl developed fever, sore throat and conjunctive injection after contact with an upper respiratory infection patient, followed by seizures, haematuria, and severe diarrhoea. She experienced viral sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction after admission. Cerebral computed tomography showed significant diffuse encephaledema. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed significantly elevated protein levels. After her consciousness disturbance improved, she still took a long time to recover from haematuria and diarrhoea. We identified a rarely reported rhinovirus A45 in her oropharyngeal and anal swabs by metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and bacterial culture of blood specimens yielded negative results.              Conclusions:                    This case presents a patient with severe rhinovirus infection, which was very likely responsible for her central nervous system symptoms and viral sepsis.",-1
Computed Tomography Measures of Nutrition in Patients With End-Stage Liver Disease Provide a Novel Approach to Characterize Deficits,"Background:                    Patients with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) develop severe nutrition deficits that affect morbidity and mortality. Laboratory measures of nutrition fail to fully assess clinical deficits in muscle mass and fat stores. This study employs computed tomography imaging to assess muscle mass and subcutaneous and visceral fat stores in patients with ESLD.              Methods:                    This 1:1 case-control study design compares ESLD patients with healthy controls. Study patients were selected from a database of ESLD patients using a stratified method to assure a representative sample based on age, body mass index (BMI), sex, and model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD). Control patients were trauma patients with a low injury severity score (<10) who had a computed tomography scan during evaluation. Cases and controls were matched for age Â± 5 years, sex, and BMI Â± 2.              Results:                    There were 90 subjects and 90 controls. ESLD patients had lower albumin levels (P < .001), but similar total protein levels (P = .72). ESLD patients had a deficit in muscle mass (-19%, P < .001) and visceral fat (-13%, P < .001), but similar subcutaneous fat (-1%, P = .35). ESLD patients at highest risk for sarcopenia included those over age 60, BMI<25.0, and female sex. We found degree of sarcopenia to be independent of model for end-stage liver disease score.              Conclusions:                    These results support previous research demonstrating substantial nutrition deficits in ESLD patients that are not adequately measured by laboratory testing. Patients with ESLD have significant deficits of muscle and visceral fat stores, but a similar amount of subcutaneous fat.",-1
"Safety and Efficacy of Pitavastatin in Patients With Impaired Fasting Glucose and Hyperlipidemia: A Randomized, Open-labeled, Multicentered, Phase IV Study","Purpose:                    Although the role of high-intensity lipid-lowering therapy in cardiovascular protection has broadened, concerns still exist about new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM), especially in vulnerable patients. This study aimed to compare the effect of high-dose (4 mg/d) and usual dose (2 mg/d) pitavastatin on glucose metabolism in patients with hyperlipidemia and impaired fasting glucose (IFG).              Methods:                    In this 12-month study, glucose tolerance and lipid-lowering efficacy of high-dose pitavastatin (4 mg [study group]) was compared with that of usual dose pitavastatin (2 mg [control group]) in patients with hyperlipidemia and IFG. The primary end point was the change of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 24 weeks of treatment. The secondary end points were as follows: (1) NODM within 1 year after treatment, (2) change of lipid parameters, (3) changes of adiponectin, and (4) change of blood glucose and insulin levels.              Findings:                    Of the total 417 patients screened, 313 patients with hypercholesterolemia and IFG were randomly assigned into groups. The mean (SD) change in HbA1c was 0.06% (0.20%) in the study group and 0.03% (0.22%) in the control group (P = 0.27). Within 1 year, 27 patients (12.3%) developed NODM, including 12 (10.6%) of 113 patients in the study group and 15 (14.2%) of 106 in the control group (P = 0.43). The study group had a significantly higher reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-C levels and a higher increase in apolipoprotein A1/apolipoprotein B ratio (0.68 [0.40] vs 0.51 [0.35], P < 0.01).              Implications:                    The high-dose pitavastatin therapy did not aggravate glucose metabolism compared with the usual dose therapy. Moreover, it had a better effect on cholesterol-lowering and apolipoprotein distribution in the patients with hyperlipidemia and IFG.",-1
Intrapancreatic fat deposition and visceral fat volume are associated with the presence of diabetes after acute pancreatitis,"Ectopic fat and abdominal adiposity phenotypes have never been studied holistically in individuals after acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of the study was to investigate phenotypical differences in ectopic fat and abdominal fat between individuals after AP (with and without diabetes) and to determine the role of pancreatitis-related factors. Eighty-four individuals were studied cross-sectionally after a median of 21.5 mo since last episode of AP and were categorized into ""diabetes"" and ""no diabetes"" groups. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were also recruited. With the use of magnetic resonance imaging, intrapancreatic fat percentage, liver fat percentage, visceral fat volume (VFV), subcutaneous fat volume, and visceral-to-subcutaneous (V/S) fat volume ratio were quantified. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in these phenotypes between the groups. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the association between pancreatitis-related factors and the studied phenotypes. Intrapancreatic fat percentage was significantly higher in the diabetes group (10.2 Â± 1.2%) compared with the no diabetes (9.2 Â± 1.7%) and healthy volunteers (7.9 Â± 1.9%) groups (P < 0.001). VFV was significantly higher in the diabetes (2,715.3 Â±1,077.6 cm3) compared with no diabetes (1,983.2 Â± 1,092.4 cm3) and healthy volunteer (1,126.2 Â± 740.4 cm3) groups (P < 0.001). V/S fat volume ratio was significantly higher in the diabetes (0.97 Â± 0.27) compared with no diabetes (0.68 Â± 0.42) and healthy volunteer (0.52 Â± 0.34) groups (P = 0.001). Biliary AP was associated with significantly higher intrapancreatic fat percentage (Î² = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.01, 1.33; P = 0.047). C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization for AP were associated with significantly higher VFV (Î² = 3.32; 95% CI, 1.68, 4.96; P < 0.001). In conclusion, individuals with diabetes after AP have higher intrapancreatic fat percentage, VFV, and V/S fat volume ratio. Levels of C-reactive protein during AP are significantly associated with VFV, whereas biliary AP is significantly associated with intrapancreatic fat percentage. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Individuals with diabetes after acute pancreatitis have significantly higher intrapancreatic fat percentage and visceral fat volume compared with individuals without diabetes after acute pancreatitis and healthy controls. C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization for acute pancreatitis and biliary etiology of acute pancreatitis are associated with significantly larger visceral fat and pancreatic fat depots, respectively.",-1
Resveratrol Inhibition of the WNT/Î²-Catenin Pathway following Discogenic Low Back Pain,"Low back pain (LBP) management is an important clinical issue. Inadequate LBP control has consequences on the mental and physical health of patients. Thus, acquiring new information on LBP mechanism would increase the available therapeutic tools. Resveratrol is a natural compound with many beneficial effects. In this study, we investigated the role of resveratrol on behavioral changes, inflammation and oxidative stress induced by LBP. Ten microliters of Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected in the lumbar intervertebral disk of Sprague Dawley rats to induce degeneration, and resveratrol was administered daily. Behavioral analyses were performed on day zero, three, five and seven, and the animals were sacrificed to evaluate the molecular pathways involved. Resveratrol administration alleviated hyperalgesia, motor disfunction and allodynia. Resveratrol administration significantly reduced the loss of notochordal cells and degenerative changes in the intervertebral disk. From the molecular point of view, resveratrol reduced the 5th/6th lumbar (L5-6) spinal activation of the WNT pathway, reducing the expression of WNT3a and cysteine-rich domain frizzled (FZ)8 and the accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear Î²-catenin. Moreover, resveratrol reduced the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-18 that are target genes strictly downstream of the WNT/Î²-catenin pathway. It also showed important anti-inflammatory activities by reducing the activation of the NFkB pathway, the expression of iNOS and COX-2, and the levels of PGE2 in the lumbar spinal cord. Moreover, resveratrol reduced the oxidative stress associated with inflammation and pain, as shown by the observed reduced lipid peroxidation and increased GSH, SOD, and CAT activities. Therefore, resveratrol administration controlled the WNT/Î²-catenin pathway and the related inflammatory and oxidative alterations, thus alleviating the behavioral changes induced by LBP.",-1
The Role of MIF and IL-10 as Molecular Yin-Yang in the Modulation of the Host Immune Microenvironment During Infections: African Trypanosome Infections as a Paradigm,"African trypanosomes are extracellular flagellated unicellular protozoan parasites transmitted by tsetse flies and causing Sleeping Sickness disease in humans and Nagana disease in cattle and other livestock. These diseases are usually characterized by the development of a fatal chronic inflammatory disease if left untreated. During African trypanosome infection and many other infectious diseases, the immune response is mediating a see-saw balance between effective/protective immunity and excessive infection-induced inflammation that can cause collateral tissue damage. African trypanosomes are known to trigger a strong type I pro-inflammatory response, which contributes to peak parasitaemia control, but this can culminate into the development of immunopathologies, such as anaemia and liver injury, if not tightly controlled. In this context, the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and the interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokines may operate as a molecular ""Yin-Yang"" in the modulation of the host immune microenvironment during African trypanosome infection, and possibly other infectious diseases. MIF is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine and critical upstream mediator of immune and inflammatory responses, associated with exaggerated inflammation and immunopathology. For example, it plays a crucial role in the pro-inflammatory response against African trypanosomes and other pathogens, thereby promoting the development of immunopathologies. On the other hand, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, acting as a master regulator of inflammation during both African trypanosomiasis and other diseases. IL-10 is crucial to counteract the strong MIF-induced pro-inflammatory response, leading to pathology control. Hence, novel strategies capable of blocking MIF and/or promoting IL-10 receptor signaling pathways, could potentially be used as therapy to counteract immunopathology development during African trypanosome infection, as well as during other infectious conditions. Together, this review aims at summarizing the current knowledge on the opposite immunopathological molecular ""Yin-Yang"" switch roles of MIF and IL-10 in the modulation of the host immune microenvironment during infection, and more particularly during African trypanosomiasis as a paradigm.",-1
What Is IL-1 for? The Functions of Interleukin-1 Across Evolution,"Interleukin-1 is a cytokine with potent inflammatory and immune-amplifying effects, mainly produced by macrophages during defensive reactions. In mammals, IL-1 is a superfamily of eleven structurally similar proteins, all involved in inflammation or its control, which mainly act through binding to specific receptors on the plasma membrane of target cells. IL-1 receptors are also a family of ten structurally similar transmembrane proteins that assemble in heterocomplexes. In addition to their innate immune/inflammatory effects, the physiological role of IL-1 family cytokines seems to be linked to the development of adaptive immunity in vertebrates. We will discuss why IL-1 developed in vertebrates and what is its physiological role, as a basis for understanding when and how it can be involved in the initiation and establishment of pathologies.",-1
A Single-Institute Experience with C-ros Oncogene 1 Translocation in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers in Taiwan,"(1) Background: The C-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) gene translocation is an important biomarker for selecting patients for crizotinib-targeted therapy. The aim of this study was to understand the incidence, diagnostic algorithm, clinical course and objective response to crizotinib in ROS1 translocated lung non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in Taiwan. (2) Methods: First, we retrospectively studied the ROS1 status in 100 NSCLC samples using break-apart fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to establish a diagnostic algorithm. Then, we performed routine ROS1 IHC tests in 479 NSCLCs, as crizotinib was available from 2018 in Taiwan. We analyzed the objective response rate and the survival impact of crizotinib. (3) Results: Four ROS1 translocations were clustered in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type adenocarcinomas but not in cases with EGFR mutations. Strong ROS1 expression was positively correlated with ROS1 translocation (p &lt; 0.001). NSCLCs with ROS1 translocation had a poor prognosis compared to those without ROS1 translocation (p = 0.004) in the pre-crizotinib stage. Twenty NSCLCs were detected with ROS1 translocation in 479 wild-type EGFR specimens from 2018. Therefore, the incidence of ROS1 translocation is approximately 4.18% in EGFR wild-type NSCLCs. In these 20 ROS1 translocation cases, 19 patients received crizotinib treatment, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 78.95% (confidence interval = 69.34% to 88.56%), including 1 complete response, 14 partial responses, 3 stable cases and 1 progressive case. Overall survival and progression-free survival were better in the 19 ROS1-translocated NSCLCs of the prospective group with crizotinib treatment than the four ROS1-translocated NSCLCs of the retrospective group without crizotinib treatment. (4) Conclusions: ROS1-translocated NSCLCs had a poor prognosis and could have a beneficial outcome with crizotinib.",-1
Sex-specific effects of central adiposity and inflammatory markers on limbic microstructure,"Midlife obesity is a risk factor of late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) but why this is the case remains unknown. As systemic inflammation is involved in both conditions, obesity-related neuroinflammation may contribute to damage in limbic structures important in LOAD. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that systemic inflammation would mediate central obesity related effects on limbic tissue microstructure in 166 asymptomatic individuals (38-71 years old). We employed MRI indices sensitive to myelin and neuroinflammation [macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) and kf] from quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) together with indices from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to investigate the effects of central adiposity on the fornix, parahippocampal cingulum, uncinate fasciculus (compared with whole brain white matter and corticospinal tract) and the hippocampus. Central obesity was assessed with the Waist Hip Ratio (WHR) and abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat area fractions (VFF, SFF), and systemic inflammation with blood plasma concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein and interleukin 8. Men were significantly more centrally obese and had higher VFF than women. Individual differences in WHR and in VFF were negatively correlated with differences in fornix MPF and kf, but not with any differences in neurite microstructure. In women, age mediated the effects of VFF on fornix MPF and kf, whilst in men differences in the leptin and adiponectin ratio fully mediated the effect of WHR on fornix MPF. These results suggest that visceral fat related systemic inflammation may damage myelin-related properties of the fornix, a key limbic structure known to be involved in LOAD.",-1
Are BPA Substitutes as Obesogenic as BPA?,"Metabolic diseases, such as obesity, Type II diabetes and hepatic steatosis, are a significant public health concern affecting more than half a billion people worldwide. The prevalence of these diseases is constantly increasing in developed countries, affecting all age groups. The pathogenesis of metabolic diseases is complex and multifactorial. Inducer factors can either be genetic or linked to a sedentary lifestyle and/or consumption of high-fat and sugar diets. In 2002, a new concept of ""environmental obesogens"" emerged, suggesting that environmental chemicals could play an active role in the etiology of obesity. Bisphenol A (BPA), a xenoestrogen widely used in the plastic food packaging industry has been shown to affect many physiological functions and has been linked to reproductive, endocrine and metabolic disorders and cancer. Therefore, the widespread use of BPA during the last 30 years could have contributed to the increased incidence of metabolic diseases. BPA was banned in baby bottles in Canada in 2008 and in all food-oriented packaging in France from 1 January 2015. Since the BPA ban, substitutes with a similar structure and properties have been used by industrials even though their toxic potential is unknown. Bisphenol S has mainly replaced BPA in consumer products as reflected by the almost ubiquitous human exposure to this contaminant. This review focuses on the metabolic effects and targets of BPA and recent data, which suggest comparable effects of the structural analogs used as substitutes.",-1
Estimating the potential impact of Attractive Targeted Sugar Baits (ATSBs) as a new vector control tool for Plasmodium falciparum malaria,"Background:                    Attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) are a promising new tool for malaria control as they can target outdoor-feeding mosquito populations, in contrast to current vector control tools which predominantly target indoor-feeding mosquitoes.              Methods:                    It was sought to estimate the potential impact of these new tools on Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence in African settings by combining data from a recent entomological field trial of ATSBs undertaken in Mali with mathematical models of malaria transmission. The key parameter determining impact on the mosquito population is the excess mortality due to ATSBs, which is estimated from the observed reduction in mosquito catch numbers. A mathematical model capturing the life cycle of P. falciparum malaria in mosquitoes and humans and incorporating the excess mortality was used to estimate the potential epidemiological effect of ATSBs.              Results:                    The entomological study showed a significant reduction of ~ 57% (95% CI 33-72%) in mosquito catch numbers, and a larger reduction of ~ 89% (95% CI 75-100%) in the entomological inoculation rate due to the fact that, in the presence of ATSBs, most mosquitoes do not live long enough to transmit malaria. The excess mortality due to ATSBs was estimated to be lower (mean 0.09 per mosquito per day, seasonal range 0.07-0.11 per day) than the bait feeding rate obtained from one-day staining tests (mean 0.34 per mosquito per day, seasonal range 0.28-0.38 per day).              Conclusions:                    From epidemiological modelling, it was predicted that ATSBs could result in large reductions (> 30% annually) in prevalence and clinical incidence of malaria, even in regions with an existing high malaria burden. These results suggest that this new tool could provide a promising addition to existing vector control tools and result in significant reductions in malaria burden across a range of malaria-endemic settings.",-1
Antitumor bioactivity and gut microbiota modulation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in a rat animal model for colorectal cancer,"Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a non-toxic polyhydroxyalkanoate polymer produced by several microorganisms, widely used as a biological substitute for plastics derived from fossil hydrocarbons. In this work, PHB polymer has been tested in an animal model for colorectal cancer. In the animal model, PHB has been able to reduce the number of polyps by 48,1%, and the tumoral extension area by 58,1%. Also, PHB induces a selective increase in beneficial gut bacterial taxons in this animal model, and a selective reduction in pro-inflammatory taxons, demonstrating its value as a nutraceutical compound. This antitumor effect is caused by gut production of 3-hydroxybutyrate and butyrate. In this animal model, 3-hydroxybutyrate is also observed in plasma and in brain tissue, after PHB consumption, making PHB supplementation interesting as a bioactive compound in other extraintestinal conditions, as 3-hydroxybutyrate has been reported to enhance brain and cognitive function, cardiac performance, appetite suppression and diabetes. Therefore, PHB could be postulated as an interesting non-polysaccharide antitumor prebiotic, paving the way towards its future use in functional foods.",-1
"Association of Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and depression in the elderly over 55 years in Northern China: analysis of data from a multicentre, cohort study","Objectives:                    Our study aimed to assess the association between the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and depression in the elderly over 55 years in Northern China.              Methods:                    We analysed the data of 2022 Chinese adults aged 55 and over from a community-based neurological disease cohort study from 2018 to 2019. A validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess eating habits at the time of inclusion. Multiple logistic regression was used for analysis, and social demographics, lifestyle and health-related factors were adjusted.              Results:                    Among the included population, the prevalence of depression was 23.39%. Mean (SD) and range of the DII in the included population were 1.70 (1.42) and -5.20 to +5.68. The risk of depression was significantly higher in participants in the most pro-inflammatory group (quartile 4) than in the participants in the most anti-inflammatory group (quartile 1) (OR 1.53; 1.37 to 1.82; p-trend=0.01). The subgroup analysis of body mass index (BMI) showed that there is a significant association between DII and the risk of depression in overweight and obese people (pï¼?.05). The restricted cubic spline results show that the OR value of depression possesses an upward trend with the increase of the DII score.              Conclusions:                    Aged patients with depression present a higher potential for dietary inflammation. Pro-inflammatory diets might increase the risk of depressive symptoms. Further research in different populations is crucial to confirm the association between DII and depression.",-1
A self-driven approach for multi-class discrimination in Alzheimer's disease based on wearable EEG,"Early detection is critical to control Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and postpone cognitive decline. Traditional medical procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging are costly, involve long waiting lists, and require complex analysis. Alternatively, for the past years, researchers have successfully evaluated AD detection approaches based on machine learning and electroencephalography (EEG). Nonetheless, these approaches frequently rely upon manual processing or involve non-portable EEG hardware. These aspects are suboptimal regarding automated diagnosis, since they require additional personnel and hinder portability. In this work, we report the preliminary evaluation of a self-driven AD multi-class discrimination approach based on a commercial EEG acquisition system using sixteen channels. For this purpose, we recorded the EEG of three groups of participants: mild AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) non-AD, and controls, and we implemented a self-driven analysis pipeline to discriminate the three groups. First, we applied automated artifact rejection algorithms to the EEG recordings. Then, we extracted power, entropy, and complexity features from the preprocessed epochs. Finally, we evaluated a multi-class classification problem using a multi-layer perceptron through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The preliminary results that we obtained are comparable to the best in literature (0.88 F1-score), what suggests that AD can potentially be detected through a self-driven approach based on commercial EEG and machine learning. We believe this work and further research could contribute to opening the door for the detection of AD in a single consultation session, therefore reducing the costs associated to AD screening and potentially advancing medical treatment.",-1
Nuclear microRNA-466c regulates Vegfa expression in response to hypoxia,"MicroRNAs are well characterized in their role in silencing gene expression by targeting 3Â´-UTR of mRNAs in cytoplasm. However, recent studies have shown that miRNAs have a role in the regulation of genes in the nucleus, where they are abundantly located. We show here that in mouse endothelial cell line (C166), nuclear microRNA miR-466c participates in the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor a (Vegfa) gene expression in hypoxia. Upregulation of Vegfa expression in response to hypoxia was significantly compromised after removal of miR-466c with CRISPR-Cas9 genomic deletion. We identified a promoter-associated long non-coding RNA on mouse Vegfa promoter and show that miR-466c directly binds to this transcript to modulate Vegfa expression. Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-466c regulates Vegfa gene transcription in the nucleus by targeting the promoter, and expands on our understanding of the role of miRNAs well beyond their canonical role.",-1
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Neonates Born to Mothers with SARS-CoV-2 Infection (MIS-N) and in Neonates and Infants Younger Than 6 Months with Acquired COVID-19 (MIS-C): A Systematic Review,"(1) Introduction: There is an increasing literature describing neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection (MIS-N) and infants infected with SARS-CoV-2 who presented with a severe disease (MIS-C). (2) Methods: To investigate clinical features of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in neonates and infants under six months of age, we used a systematic search to retrieve all relevant publications in the field. We screened in PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus for data published until 10 October 2021. (3) Results: Forty-eight articles were considered, including 29 case reports, six case series and 13 cohort studies. Regarding clinical features, only 18.2% of MIS-N neonates presented with fever; differently from older children with MIS-C, in which gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common manifestation, we displayed that cardiovascular dysfunction and respiratory distress are the prevalent findings both in neonates with MIS-N and in neonates/infants with MIS-C. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that all infants with suspected inflammatory disease should undergo echocardiography, due to the possibility of myocardial dysfunction and damage to the coronary arteries observed both in neonates with MIS-N and in neonates/infants with MIS-C. Moreover, we also summarize how they were treated and provide a therapeutic algorithm to suggest best management of these fragile infants.",-1
Identification of the toxic 6mer seed consensus for human cancer cells,"6mer seed toxicity is a novel cell death mechanism that kills cancer cells by triggering death induced by survival gene elimination (DISE). It is based on si- or shRNAs with a specific G-rich nucleotide composition in position 2-7 of their guide strand. An arrayed screen of 4096 6mer seeds on two human and two mouse cell lines identified G-rich 6mers as the most toxic seeds. We have now tested two additional cell lines, one human and one mouse, identifying the GGGGGC consensus as the most toxic average 6mer seed for human cancer cells while slightly less significant for mouse cancer cells. RNA Seq and bioinformatics analyses suggested that an siRNA containing the GGGGGC seed (siGGGGGC) is toxic to cancer cells by targeting GCCCCC seed matches located predominantly in the 3' UTR of a set of genes critical for cell survival. We have identified several genes targeted by this seed and demonstrate direct and specific targeting of GCCCCC seed matches, which is attenuated upon mutation of the GCCCCC seed matches in these 3' UTRs. Our data show that siGGGGGC kills cancer cells through its miRNA-like activity and points at artificial miRNAs, si- or shRNAs containing this seed as a potential new cancer therapeutics.",-1
MiR-1656 targets GPX4 to trigger pyroptosis in broilers kidney tissues by activating NLRP3 inflammasome under Se deficiency,"Selenium (Se) is a vital minor element for the organism. Se deficiency caused inflammation in kidney tissue and regulate the expression of selenoproteins and microRNAs (miRNAs). Pyroptosis involved in the inflammatory response, however, whether microRNA targets GPX4 to regulate Se-deficient kidney tissue pyroptosis is unclear. In this study, broilers were divided into two groups, Control group with 0.3mg/kg Se diet and Se-deficient group with 0.03mg/kg Se diet. The dual luciferase reporter assay system and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to screen the specificity of miR-1656 and its target protein in Se-deficient broilers. We tested the pyroptosis-related genes of Se-deficient broilers kidney and miR-1656-transfected primary broilers kidney by qRT-PCR, Western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence staining. Our research indicated that the GPX4 is one of the target genes of miR-1656, and Se deficiency leaded to the overexpression of miR-1656 and the increased expression of pyroptosis-related genes. The overexpression of miR-1656 can induce increased expression of pyroptosis-related genes including NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-18, and IL-1Î² by inhibiting the release of GPX4. This study showed that miR-1656 could increase the release of ROS by targeting GPX4, activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, and release the inflammatory factors IL-1Î² and IL-18 to trigger pyroptosis in the kidney tissue of Se-deficient broilers. This finding may provide new research ideas for kidney injury and cell death due to Se deficiency.",-1
"Bloodmeal sources and feeding behavior of anopheline mosquitoes in Bure district, northwestern Ethiopia","Background:                    Mosquito bloodmeal sources determine the feeding rates, adult survival, fecundity, hatching rates, and developmental times. Only the female Anopheles mosquito takes bloodmeals from humans, birds, mammals, and other vertebrates for egg development. Studies of the host preference patterns in blood-feeding anopheline mosquitoes are crucial to determine malaria vectors. However, the human blood index, foraging ratio, and host preference index of anopheline mosquitoes are not known so far in Bure district, Ethiopia.              Methods:                    The origins of bloodmeals from all freshly fed and a few half-gravid exophagic and endophagic females collected using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps were identified as human and bovine using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The human blood index, forage ratio, and host feeding index were calculated.              Results:                    A total of 617 specimens belonging to An. arabiensis (n = 209), An. funestus (n = 217), An. coustani (n = 123), An. squamosus (n = 54), and An. cinereus (n = 14) were only analyzed using blood ELISA. Five hundred seventy-five of the specimens were positive for blood antigens of the host bloods. All anopheline mosquitoes assayed for a bloodmeal source had mixed- rather than single-source bloodmeals. The FR for humans was slightly > 1.0 compared to bovines for all Anopheles species. HFI for each pair of vertebrate hosts revealed that humans were the slightly preferred bloodmeal source compared to bovines for all species (except An. squamosus), but there was no marked host selection.              Conclusions:                    All anopheline mosquitoes assayed for bloodmeal ELISA had mixed feeds, which tends to diminish the density of gametocytes in the mosquito stomach, thereby reducing the chance of fertilization of the female gamete and reducing the chances of a malaria vector becoming infected. Moreover, An. coustani was the only species that had only human bloodmeals, meaning that this species has the potential to transmit the disease. Therefore, combination zooprophylaxis should be reinforced as a means of vector control because the study sites are mixed dwellings.",-1
Replacement of animal testing by integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA): a call for in vivitrosi,"Alternative methods to animal use in toxicology are evolving with new advanced tools and multilevel approaches, to answer from one side to 3Rs requirements, and on the other side offering relevant and valid tests for drugs and chemicals, considering also their combination in test strategies, for a proper risk assessment.While stand-alone methods, have demonstrated to be applicable for some specific toxicological predictions with some limitations, the new strategy for the application of New Approach Methods (NAM), to solve complex toxicological endpoints is addressed by Integrated Approaches for Testing and Assessment (IATA), aka Integrated Testing Strategies (ITS) or Defined Approaches for Testing and Assessment (DA). The central challenge of evidence integration is shared with the needs of risk assessment and systematic reviews of an evidence-based Toxicology. Increasingly, machine learning (aka Artificial Intelligence, AI) lends itself to integrate diverse evidence streams.In this article, we give an overview of the state of the art of alternative methods and IATA in toxicology for regulatory use for various hazards, outlining future orientation and perspectives. We call on leveraging the synergies of integrated approaches and evidence integration from in vivo, in vitro and in silico as true in vivitrosi.",-1
The actual use of directional steering and shorter pulse width in selected patients undergoing deep brain stimulation,"Introduction:                    Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) and pulse with <60Î¼s increase side-effects threshold, enlarging the therapeutic window. However, new systems allowing these advanced features are more expensive and often available only for a limited number of patients in some centers. It is unknown how many and which DBS patients actually need the advanced features because of an insufficient improvement with standard parameters.              Methods:                    We included in the analysis all patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia and tremor who were selected to receive implantation of advanced DBS systems based on specific preoperative or intraoperative clinical features.              Results:                    After a median follow-up of 15 months, 54.9% of the 51 patients implanted with directional leads were using the advanced features in one or both leads (n = 42 leads, 42%), meaning these leads were programmed either with directional stimulation (n = 9, 9%), a shorter pw (n = 20, 20%) or both (n = 13, 13%). This included 92% of patients implanted in the Vim, 44% of those implanted in the STN, and 40% of those implanted in the GPi.              Conclusions:                    DBS systems with advanced features may be particularly indicated for selected patients based on some clinical characteristics and the chosen target. This data may help clinicians allocate resources in a more informed way.",-1
Clinical feasibility of an abdominal thin-slice breath-hold single-shot fast spin echo sequence processed using a deep learning-based noise-reduction approach,"Background:                    T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) is a key sequence of MRI studies of the pancreas. The single-shot fast spin echo (single-shot FSE) sequence is an accelerated form of T2WI. We hypothesized that denoising approach with deep learning-based reconstruction (dDLR) could facilitate accelerated breath-hold thin-slice single-shot FSE MRI, and reveal the pancreatic anatomy in detail.              Purpose:                    To assess the image quality of thin-slice (3 mm) respiratory-triggered FSE T2WI (Resp-FSE) and breath-hold fast advanced spin echo with and without dDLR (BH-dDLR-FASE and BH-FASE, respectively) at 1.5 T.              Materials and methods:                    MR images of 42 prospectively enrolled patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary disease were obtained at 1.5 T. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated image quality of BH-dDLR-FASE related to BH-FASE and Resp-FSE.              Results:                    The scan time of BH-FASE was significantly shorter than that of Resp-FSE (30 Â± 4 s and 122 Â± 25 s, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, dDLR significantly improved BH-FASE image quality, and the image quality of BH-dDLR-FASE was significantly better than that of Resp-FSE; as quantitative parameters, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of BH-dDLR-FASE were also significantly better than those of Resp-FSE. The BH-dDLR-FASE sequence covered the entire pancreas and liver and provided overall image quality rated close to excellent.              Conclusions:                    The dDLR technique enables accelerated thin-slice single-shot FSE, and BH-dDLR-FASE seems to be clinically feasible.",-1
"Characterization of a thermostable, protease-tolerant inhibitor of Î±-glycosidase from carrot: A potential oral additive for treatment of diabetes","Inhibiting Î±-glucosidase activity is important in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia and, thus, helping to manage type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In the present study, we purified a hypothetical protein of carrots called DCHP (Daucus Carrot hypoglycemic peptide), and their inhibitory effects on Î±-glucosidase, as well as related mechanisms, were investigated. The recombinant DCHP protein with a molecular weight of 8 kDa showed strong inhibitory activity against Î±-glycosidase and maintained good stability in solution. DCHP exhibited no inhibitory activity but was tolerant to trypsin and chymotrypsin. Cellular experiments demonstrated that glucose consumption and lactic acid production increased rapidly when treated with DCHP in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells. DCHP crystal was generated, and the crystal structure, which was similar to that of rBTI and consisted of a central Î±-helix and a two-stranded Î²-sheet with a unique loop region. The interaction between DCHP and Î±-glycosidase was investigated by molecular docking and site-directed mutation, which revealed that Glu43, Pro46, Thr47 Thr48 and Gln49 are the key residues in DCHP that inhibit Î±-glycosidase activity. This work provides potential bioactive peptides as functional foods or nutraceutical supplements in preventing and managing T2DM.",-1
Host liver-derived extracellular vesicles deliver miR-142a-3p induces neutrophil extracellular traps via targeting WASL to block the development of Schistosoma japonicum,"Schistosomiasis is an important neglected tropical disease. Interactions between the host immune system and schistosomes are complex. Neutrophils contribute to clearance of large pathogens primarily by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, the functional role of NETs in clearing schistosomes remains unclear. Herein, we report that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from the liver of Schistosoma japonicum-infected mice (IL-EVs) induce NET release by delivering miR-142a-3p to target WASL and block the development of S. japonicum. WASL knockout accelerated the formation of NETs that blocked further development of S. japonicum. miR-142a-3p and NETs upregulated the expression of CCL2, which recruits macrophages that block S. japonicum development. However, S. japonicum inhibited NET formation in wild-type mice by upregulating host interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression. In contrast, in WASL knockout mice, IL-10 expression was downregulated, and S. japonicum-mediated inhibition of NET formation was significantly reduced. IL-EV-mediated induction of NET formation is thus an anti-schistosome response that can be counteracted by S. japonicum. These findings suggest that IL-EV-mediated induction of NET formation plays a key role in schistosome infection and that WASL is a potential therapeutic target in schistosomiasis and other infectious diseases.",-1
"Intestinal gluconeogenesis shapes gut microbiota, fecal and urine metabolome in mice with gastric bypass surgery","Intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN), gastric bypass (GBP) and gut microbiota positively regulate glucose homeostasis and diet-induced dysmetabolism. GBP modulates gut microbiota, whether IGN could shape it has not been investigated. We studied gut microbiota and microbiome in wild type and IGN-deficient mice, undergoing GBP or not, and fed on either a normal chow (NC) or a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. We also studied fecal and urine metabolome in NC-fed mice. IGN and GBP had a different effect on the gut microbiota of mice fed with NC and HFHS diet. IGN inactivation increased abundance of Deltaproteobacteria on NC and of Proteobacteria such as Helicobacter on HFHS diet. GBP increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on NC-fed WT mice and of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria on HFHS-fed WT mice. The combined effect of IGN inactivation and GBP increased abundance of Actinobacteria on NC and the abundance of Enterococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae on HFHS diet. A reduction was observed in the amounf of short-chain fatty acids in fecal (by GBP) and in both fecal and urine (by IGN inactivation) metabolome. IGN and GBP, separately or combined, shape gut microbiota and microbiome on NC- and HFHS-fed mice, and modify fecal and urine metabolome.",-1
Thymoquinone Alterations of the Apoptotic Gene Expressions and Cell Cycle Arrest in Genetically Distinct Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and it is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women. triple-negative breast Cancer (TNBC), a subtype of BC, is typically associated with the highest pathogenic grade and incidence in premenopausal and young African American (AA) women. Chemotherapy, the most common treatment for TNBC today, can lead to acquired resistance and ineffective treatment. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are needed to combat medication resistance and ineffectiveness in TNBC patients. Thymoquinone (TQ) is shown to have a cytotoxic effect on human cancer cells in vitro. However, TQ's mode of action and precise mechanism in TNBC disease in vitro have not been adequately investigated. Therefore, TQ's effects on the genetically different MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines were assessed. The data obtained show that TQ displayed cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner after 24 h, with IC50 values of 25.37 ÂµM and 27.39 ÂµM, respectively. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in a scratched wound-healing assay displayed poor wound closure, inhibiting invasion and migration via cell cycle blocking after 24 h. TQ arrested the cell cycle phase in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. The three cell cycle stages in MDA-MB-468 cells were significantly affected at 15 and 20 ÂµM for G0/G1 and S phases, as well as all TQ concentrations for G2/M phases. In MDA-MB-468 cells, there was a significant decrease in G0/G1 phases with a substantial increase in the S phase and G2/M phases. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 showed a significant effect only during the two cell cycle stages (S and G2/M), at concentrations of 15 and 20 ÂµM for S phases and all TQ values for G2/M phases. The TQ effect on the apoptotic gene profiles indicated that TQ upregulated 15 apoptotic genes in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells, including caspases, GADD45A, TP53, DFFA, DIABLO, BNIP3, TRAF2/3, and TNFRSF10A. In MDA-MB-468 cells, 16 apoptotic genes were upregulated, including TNFRSF10A, TNF, TNFRSF11B, FADD TNFRSF10B, CASP2, and TRAF2, all of which are important for the apoptotic pathway andsuppress the expression of one anti-apoptotic gene, BIRC5, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Compared to MDA-MB-231 cells, elevated levels of TNF and their receptor proteins may contribute to their increased sensitivity to TQ-induced apoptosis. It was concluded from this study that TQ targets the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells differently. Additionally, due to the aggressive nature of TNBC and the lack of specific therapies in chemoresistant TNBC, our findings related to the identified apoptotic gene profile may point to TQ as a potential agent for TNBC therapy.",-1
"""Many roads lead to Rome and the Artificial Intelligence only shows me one road"": an interview study on physician attitudes regarding the implementation of computerised clinical decision support systems","Research regarding the drivers of acceptance of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) by physicians is still rather limited. The literature that does exist, however, tends to focus on problems regarding the user-friendliness of CDSS. We have performed a thematic analysis of 24 interviews with physicians concerning specific clinical case vignettes, in order to explore their underlying opinions and attitudes regarding the introduction of CDSS in clinical practice, to allow a more in-depth analysis of factors underlying (non-)acceptance of CDSS. We identified three general themes from the results. First, 'the perceived role of the AI', including items referring to the tasks that may properly be assigned to the CDSS according to the respondents. Second, 'the perceived role of the physician', referring to the aspects of clinical practice that were seen as being fundamentally 'human' or non-automatable. Third, 'concerns regarding AI', including items referring to more general issues that were raised by the respondents regarding the introduction of CDSS in general and/or in clinical medicine in particular. Apart from the overall concerns expressed by the respondents regarding user-friendliness, we will explain how our results indicate that our respondents were primarily occupied by distinguishing between parts of their job that should be automated and aspects that should be kept in human hands. We refer to this distinction as 'the division of clinical labor.' This division is not based on knowledge regarding AI or medicine, but rather on which parts of a physician's job were seen by the respondents as being central to who they are as physicians and as human beings. Often the respondents' view that certain core parts of their job ought to be shielded from automation was closely linked to claims concerning the uniqueness of medicine as a domain. Finally, although almost all respondents claimed that they highly value their final responsibility, a closer investigation of this concept suggests that their view of 'final responsibility' was not that demanding after all.",-1
"Effects of vitamin D supplementation on fasting glucose, dyslipidemia, blood pressure, and abdominal obesity among patients with metabolic syndrome: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Background:                    Vitamin D deficiency can play a role in extraskeletal functions that are involved with a set of risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The purpose of this review is to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on fasting glucose, dyslipidemia, blood pressure, and abdominal obesity among patients with MetS.              Methods:                    EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, Lilacs, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, clinicaltrials.gov databases, and grey literature will be systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation compared with placebo, through December 2020. We will include in the study patients with MetS diagnosed by the criteria set forth by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III or the International Diabetes Federation. The effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lipid profile improvement (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-HDL-C) is this review's primary outcome. The systematic review will be performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study screening, data extraction, and quality assessment will be fulfilled by two independent reviewers according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0). The results of the systematic review will be provided according to the type of intervention, characteristics of the target population, the methods of measurement of vitamin D, the calculated vitamin D concentrations, types of biological samples, and types of outcomes. Meta-analyses will be conducted where appropriate. The Cochran's Q test and the I2-heterogeneity test will be used to assess the presence of heterogeneity and whether the fixed or the random-effects model would be appropriate for combining study results using the inverse variance method or the DerSimonian-Lair method, respectively. Publication bias will be evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's and Begg's tests. The strength of the evidence will be assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).              Discussion:                    This systematic review will assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on fasting glucose and triglyceride levels, waist circumference and mean blood pressure, and HDL-C among individuals with MetS. These findings may assist with decision-making within a clinical setting.              Systematic review registration:                    PROSPERO registration number CRD42019123212.",-1
Supplementation of Bacillus sp. DU-106 Alleviates Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Association with the Regulation of Intestinal Microbiota in Mice,"Bacillus sp. DU-106, a potential probiotic, has been proved to activate innate immunity, reduce hypercholesterolemia, and regulate the gut microbiota of mice. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of strain DU-106 in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) via analyzing the changes in gut microbial composition in mice. The results indicated that supplementation of strain DU-106 alleviated gastrointestinal symptoms, improved gut barrier integrity and immunoglobulin-A level of mice with AAD. A 16S rRNA sequencing showed that antibiotics decreased bacterial diversity and the abundances of Alistipes, Roseburia, Hungatella, Eubacterium-xylanophilum, Lachnospiraceae-UCG-001, Intestinimonas, and Lachnospiraceae-NK4A136, but increased the abundance of Klebsiella, Bacteroidota, and Verrucomicrobiota. However, strain DU-106 treatment reversed these alternations in mice with AAD. In conclusion, strain DU-106 could alleviate AAD in association with the regulation of intestinal microbiota and could be used as an alternative treatment for AAD.",-1
Health influenced by genetics: A first comprehensive analysis of breast cancer high and moderate penetrance susceptibility genes in the Tunisian population,"Significant advances have been made to understand the genetic basis of breast cancer. High, moderate and low penetrance variants have been identified with inter-ethnic variability in mutation frequency and spectrum. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to identify disease-associated SNPs. Understanding the functional impact of these risk-SNPs will help the translation of GWAS findings into clinical interventions. Here we aim to characterize the genetic patterns of high and moderate penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes and to assess the functional impact of non-coding SNPs. We analyzed BRCA1/2, PTEN, STK11, TP53, ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2 and PALB2 genotype data obtained from 135 healthy participants genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP-Array 6.0. Haplotype analysis was performed using Haploview.V4.2 and PHASE.V2.1. Population structure and genetic differentiation were assessed using principal component analysis (PCA) and fixation index (FST). Functional annotation was performed using In Silico web-based tools including RegulomeDB and VARAdb. Haplotype analysis showed distinct LD patterns with high levels of recombination and haplotype blocks of moderate to small size. Our findings revealed also that the Tunisian population tends to have a mixed origin with European, South Asian and Mexican footprints. Functional annotation allowed the selection of 28 putative regulatory variants. Of special interest were BRCA1_ rs8176318 predicted to alter the binding sites of a tumor suppressor miRNA hsa-miR-149 and PALB2_ rs120963 located in tumorigenesis-associated enhancer and predicted to strongly affect the binding of P53. Significant differences in allele frequencies were observed with populations of African and European ancestries for rs8176318 and rs120963 respectively. Our findings will help to better understand the genetic basis of breast cancer by guiding upcoming genome wide studies in the Tunisian population. Putative functional SNPs may be used to develop an efficient polygenic risk score to predict breast cancer risk leading to better disease prevention and management.",-1
Is Caloric Restriction Associated with Better Healthy Aging Outcomes? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Background: Global dietary patterns have gradually shifted toward a 'western type' with progressive increases in rates of metabolic imbalance. Recently, animal and human studies have revealed positive effects of caloric restriction (CR) on many health domains, giving new knowledge for prevention of ill and health promotion; Methods: We conducted a systematic review (SR) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the role of CR on health status in adults. A meta-analysis was performed on anthropometric, cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes; Results: A total of 29 articles were retrieved including data from eight RCTs. All included RCTs were at low risk for performance bias related to objective outcomes. Collectively, articles included 704 subjects. Among the 334 subjects subjected to CR, the compliance with the intervention appeared generally high. Meta-analyses proved benefit of CR on reduction of body weight, BMI, fat mass, total cholesterol, while a minor impact was shown for LDL, fasting glucose and insulin levels. No effect emerged for HDL and blood pressure after CR. Data were insufficient for other hormone variables in relation to meta-analysis of CR effects; Conclusion: CR is a nutritional pattern linked to improved cardiometabolic status. However, evidence is limited on the multidimensional aspects of health and requires more studies of high quality to identify the precise impact of CR on health status and longevity.",-1
Identification of blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of Parkinson's disease: A systematic review of proteomics studies,"Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterised by the loss of motor function and dopamine neurons. Therapeutic avenues remain a challenge due to lack of accuracy in early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression and limited therapeutic options. Proteomic platforms have been utilised to discover biomarkers for numerous diseases, a tool that may benefit the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in PD patients. Therefore, this systematic review focuses on analysing blood-based candidate biomarkers (CB) identified via proteomics platforms for PD. This study systematically reviewed articles across six databases (EMBASE, Cochrane, Ovid Medline, Scopus, Science Direct and PubMed) published between 2010 and 2020. Of the 504 articles identified, 12 controlled-PD studies were selected for further analysis. A total of 115 candidate biomarkers (CB) were identified across selected 12-controlled studies, of which 23 CB were found to be replicable in more than two cohorts. Using the PANTHER Go-Slim classification system and STRING network, the gene function and protein interactions between biomarkers were analysed. Our analysis highlights Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), which is essential in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and neuroprotection demonstrates high replicability across five cohorts with consistent downregulation across four cohorts. Since ApoA-I was highly replicable across blood fractions, proteomic platforms and continents, its relationship with cholesterol, statin and oxidative stress as PD biomarker, its role in the pathogenesis of PD is discussed in this paper. The present study identified ApoA-I as a potential biomarker via proteomics analysis of PD for the early diagnosis and prediction of disease progression.",-1
Microbiomes mediate host-parasite interactions,"Parasitic and parasitoid organisms, including nematodes, trematodes, flies, ticks and wasps, rely on chemical cues to locate a host. In previous research, these cues were assumed to originate directly from the host, but in some cases it appears that the microbiome is responsible for emitting volatile organic compounds that can attract or repel parasites (Chavez et al., 2021; Takken & Verhulst, 2013). In a From the Cover paper in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Lutz et al. (2021) use multiscale analyses to demonstrate that members of the skin and oral, but not gut microbiome are correlated with ecto- and endoparasite occurrence in Afrotropical bats. That the microbiome may act as a beacon for searching parasites is an innovative mechanism for explaining how parasites find their host. This mechanism also changes our understanding of how evolutionary arms races occur between a host and parasite. Instead of reciprocal adaptations that allow the host to better defend and the parasite to better attack, each host and parasite may be attempting to manipulate or overcome manipulation of the microbiome that mediates the host-parasite interaction. While Lutz et al. (2021) establish that the skin and oral microbiomes are distinct between parasitized and nonparasitized individuals, they acknowledge that the directionality of this change cannot be determined from their data (i.e., does the microbiome differentially attract parasites or does the microbiome reflect the infection status of its host?). This leaves us with several interesting directions for future research. All of these future avenues of research have the potential to change our understanding of host-parasite coevolution, by necessitating that we extend our examination of this seemingly bipartite interaction to include a third actor-the microbiome.",-1
Stress Classification Using Brain Signals Based on LSTM Network,The early diagnosis of stress symptoms is essential for preventing various mental disorder such as depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently employed in stress detection research and are both inexpensive and noninvasive modality. This paper proposes a stress classification system by utilizing an EEG signal. EEG signals from thirty-five volunteers were analysed which were acquired using four EEG sensors using a commercially available 4-electrode Muse EEG headband. Four movie clips were chosen as stress elicitation material. Two clips were selected to induce stress as it contains emotionally inductive scenes. The other two clips were chosen that do not induce stress as it has many comedy scenes. The recorded signals were then used to build the stress classification model. We compared the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for classifying stress and nonstress group. The maximum classification accuracy of 93.17% was achieved using two-layer LSTM architecture.,-1
"LncRNA CASC15, MiR-23b Cluster and SMAD3 form a Novel Positive Feedback Loop to promote Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Metastasis in Ovarian Cancer","Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 15 (CASC15), which is a newly identified long noncoding RNA crucial for epigenetic regulation in human tumors, was found to be associated with poor prognosis of the patients with ovarian cancer by utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus database. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to explore the functional role and latent molecular mechanism of CASC15 in the progression of ovarian cancer. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated CASC15 as an oncogenic lncRNA in ovarian cancer, which could enhance metastasis through TGF-Î²-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition progress. MiR-23b-3p and miR-24-3p, which are members of the miR-23b cluster, were identified to directly target CASC15 through luciferase assays. Further mechanistic investigations indicated that CASC15-mediated miR-23b-3p/miR-24-3p sequestration cooperatively upregulated SMAD3 expression, which, in turn, would permit increased CASC15 mRNA level as a transcription activation factor. This study first described a miR-23b-3p/miR-24-3p-mediated positive feedback loop between CASC15 and SMAD3, which may reflect the underlying molecular mechanism of CASC15's oncogenic function in ovarian cancer.",-1
[Electrocardiogram signal classification algorithm of nested long short-term memory network based on focal loss function],"Electrocardiogram (ECG) can visually reflect the physiological electrical activity of human heart, which is important in the field of arrhythmia detection and classification. To address the negative effect of label imbalance in ECG data on arrhythmia classification, this paper proposes a nested long short-term memory network (NLSTM) model for unbalanced ECG signal classification. The NLSTM is built to learn and memorize the temporal characteristics in complex signals, and the focal loss function is used to reduce the weights of easily identifiable samples. Then the residual attention mechanism is used to modify the assigned weights according to the importance of sample characteristic to solve the sample imbalance problem. Then the synthetic minority over-sampling technique is used to perform a simple manual oversampling process on the Massachusetts institute of technology and Beth Israel hospital arrhythmia (MIT-BIH-AR) database to further increase the classification accuracy of the model. Finally, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is applied to experimentally verify the above algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively solve the issues of imbalanced samples and unremarkable features in ECG signals, and the overall accuracy of the model reaches 98.34%. It also significantly improves the recognition and classification of minority samples and has provided a new feasible method for ECG-assisted diagnosis, which has practical application significance.",-1
Forecasting Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Incidence and Burden: The ViLA-Obesity Simulation Model,"Background:                    Obesity is a major public health problem affecting millions of Americans and is considered one of the most potent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Assessing future disease burden is important for informing policy-decision making for population health and healthcare.              Objective:                    The aim of this study was to develop a computer model of a cohort of children born in Los Angeles County to study the life course incidence and trends of obesity and its effect on type 2 diabetes mellitus.              Methods:                    We built the Virtual Los Angeles cohort-ViLA, an agent-based model calibrated to the population of Los Angeles County. In particular, we developed the ViLA-Obesity model, a simulation suite within our ViLA platform that integrated trends in the causes and consequences of obesity, focusing on diabetes as a key obesity consequence during the life course. Each agent within the model exhibited obesity- and diabetes-related healthy and unhealthy behaviors such as sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, physical activity, fast-food consumption, fresh fruits, and vegetable consumption. In addition, agents could gain or lose weight and develop type 2 diabetes mellitus with a certain probability dependent on the agent's socio-demographics, past behaviors and past weight or type 2 diabetes status. We simulated 98,230 inhabitants from birth to age 65 years, living in 235 neighborhoods.              Results:                    The age-specific incidence of obesity generally increased from 10 to 30% across the life span with two notable peaks at age 6-12 and 30-39 years, while that of type 2 diabetes mellitus generally increased from <2% at age 18-24 to reach a peak of 25% at age 40-49. The 16-year risks of obesity were 32.1% (95% CI: 31.8%, 32.4%) for children aged 2-17 and 81% (95% CI: 80.8%, 81.3%) for adults aged 18-65. The 48-year risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 53.4% (95% CI: 53.1%, 53.7%) for adults aged 18-65.              Conclusion:                    This ViLA-Obesity model provides an insight into the future burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in Los Angeles County, one of the most diverse places in the United States. It serves as a platform for conducting experiments for informing evidence-based policy-making.",-1
Using Wolbachia to Eliminate Dengue: Will the Virus Fight Back?,"Recent field trials have demonstrated that dengue incidence can be substantially reduced by introgressing strains of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. This strategy relies on Wolbachia reducing the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti to disseminated infection by positive-sense RNA viruses like dengue. However, RNA viruses are well known to adapt to antiviral pressures. Here, we review the viral infection stages where selection for Wolbachia-resistant virus variants could occur. We also consider the genetic constraints imposed on viruses that alternate between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, and the likely selection pressures to which dengue virus might adapt in order to be effectively transmitted by Ae. aegypti that carry Wolbachia. While there are hurdles to dengue viruses developing resistance to Wolbachia, we suggest that long-term surveillance for resistant viruses should be an integral component of Wolbachia-introgression biocontrol programs.",-1
PPAR-Targeted Therapies in the Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Diabetic Patients,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, have been identified as key metabolic regulators in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, among others. As a leading cause of liver disease worldwide, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cause a significant burden worldwide and therapeutic strategies are needed. This review provides an overview of the evidence on PPAR-targeted treatment of NAFLD and NASH in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We considered current evidence from clinical trials and observational studies as well as the impact of treatment on comorbid metabolic conditions such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Future areas of research, such as possible sexually dimorphic effects of PPAR-targeted therapies, are briefly reviewed.",-1
Follistatin dysregulation impaired trophoblast biological functions by GDF11-Smad2/3 axis in preeclampsia placentas,"Introduction:                    Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the main causes of maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality. So far, the underlying mechanism of this pregnancy-specific syndrome remains unelucidated. The expression of Follistatin (FST) decreased in maternal serum (especially early onset severe PE) and placental trophoblasts of PE patients. However, whether FST-deficiency in preeclamptic placentas alters trophoblast function remains to be determined.              Methods:                    Trophoblast cell lines were cultured in vitro and LV3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to silence FST. Growth and differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) expression level in placentas and serum were detected by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay, respectively. To verify the effect of reduced FST expression on trophoblasts, microRNA-24-3p, which was predicted to target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of FST, was screened out, and miR-24-3p mimic, inhibitor was used to regulate FST expression in trophoblasts.              Results:                    Downregulation of FST significantly enhanced the apoptosis and impaired migration and invasion of trophoblast. Reduced FST caused the upregulation of GDF11 in trophoblasts. Interestingly, GDF11 reduced in preeclamptic placental microvascular endothelial cells. Dysregulation of FST-GDF11-Smad2/3 signaling pathway, leading to increased apoptosis of trophoblast. Expression levels of miR-24-3p, was significantly elevated in preeclamptic placentas. Trophoblast cells transfected with miR-24-3p mimics displayed impaired migration and invasion and increased apoptosis. Treated by miR-24-3p inhibitor, trophoblast cells exhibited rescued function.              Discussion:                    FST-deficiency impaired trophoblast function by upregulating GDF11 levels in trophoblasts. The regulation of FST-GDF11-Smad2/3 axis by microRNAs mimic or inhibitor may be critical to trophoblast function regulation and helps to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanism of PE.",-1
Short-Term Demand Forecasting Method in Power Markets Based on the KSVM-TCN-GBRT,"With the consumption of new energy and the variability of user activity, accurate and fast demand forecasting plays a crucial role in modern power markets. This paper considers the correlation between temperature, wind speed, and real-time electricity demand and proposes a novel method for forecasting short-term demand in the power market. Kernel Support Vector Machine is first used to classify real-time demand in combination with temperature and wind speed, and then the temporal convolutional network (TCN) is used to extract the temporal relationships and implied information of day-ahead demand. Finally, the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree is used to forecast daily and weekly real-time demand based on electrical, meteorological, and data characteristics. The validity of the method was verified using a dataset from the ISO-NE (New England Electricity Market). Comparative experiments with existing methods showed that the method could provide more accurate demand forecasting results.",-1
"A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Bifidobacterium bifidum CCFM16 for manipulation of the gut microbiota and relief from chronic constipation","A variety of opinions exist on the potential of probiotics to provide relief from chronic constipation with much focus being placed on their mechanism of action and causes of heterogeneity in the results of different studies. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of ingesting Bifidobacterium bifidum (B. bifidum) CCFM16 for 28 days to relieve constipation and to understand the mechanism of action. Using Rome IV criterion, 53 and 50 participants diagnosed with chronic constipation were included in the probiotic group and placebo group, respectively. Spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week, stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS]), the proportion of SBM responders, patient assessment of constipation symptoms (PAC-SYM), and quality of life (PAC-QoL) were evaluated. The gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other indicators were also assessed. B. bifidum CCFM16 treatment improved the stool consistency and increased the proportion of SBM responders, but the differences in PAC-SYM and PAC-QoL were statistically insignificant between the groups. Analysis of the SCFAs and microbiome revealed that CCFM16 significantly increased the acetic acid and butyric acid concentrations and enhanced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Levels of Clostridia were particularly increased and were associated with the increase in butyric acid. In addition, we found the other side of Clostridia; several taxa in the order Clostridiales were observed to prevent CCFM16 from proper functioning in the pre-treatment microbiome. In conclusion, CCFM16 can potentially and efficaciously relieve chronic constipation in Chinese adults by regulating the gut microbiota and SCFA metabolism. The two sides of Clostridia illustrate its importance in microbial therapy for constipation.",-1
Machine learning derivation of four computable 24-h pediatric sepsis phenotypes to facilitate enrollment in early personalized anti-inflammatory clinical trials,"Background:                    Thrombotic microangiopathy-induced thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure and hyperinflammatory macrophage activation syndrome are important causes of late pediatric sepsis mortality that are often missed or have delayed diagnosis. The National Institutes of General Medical Science sepsis research working group recommendations call for application of new research approaches in extant clinical data sets to improve efficiency of early trials of new sepsis therapies. Our objective is to apply machine learning approaches to derive computable 24-h sepsis phenotypes to facilitate personalized enrollment in early anti-inflammatory trials targeting these conditions.              Methods:                    We applied consensus, k-means clustering analysis to our extant PHENOtyping sepsis-induced Multiple organ failure Study (PHENOMS) dataset of 404 children. 24-hour computable phenotypes are derived using 25 available bedside variables including C-reactive protein and ferritin.              Results:                    Four computable phenotypes (PedSep-A, B, C, and D) are derived. Compared to all other phenotypes, PedSep-A patients (n = 135; 2% mortality) were younger and previously healthy, with the lowest C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, the highest lymphocyte and platelet counts, highest heart rate, and lowest creatinine (p < 0.05); PedSep-B patients (n = 102; 12% mortality) were most likely to be intubated and had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale Score (p < 0.05); PedSep-C patients (n = 110; mortality 10%) had the highest temperature and Glasgow Coma Scale Score, least pulmonary failure, and lowest lymphocyte counts (p < 0.05); and PedSep-D patients (n = 56, 34% mortality) had the highest creatinine and number of organ failures, including renal, hepatic, and hematologic organ failure, with the lowest platelet counts (p < 0.05). PedSep-D had the highest likelihood of developing thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (Adj OR 47.51 95% CI [18.83-136.83], p < 0.0001) and macrophage activation syndrome (Adj OR 38.63 95% CI [13.26-137.75], p < 0.0001).              Conclusions:                    Four computable phenotypes are derived, with PedSep-D being optimal for enrollment in early personalized anti-inflammatory trials targeting thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure and macrophage activation syndrome in pediatric sepsis. A computer tool for identification of individual patient membership ( www.pedsepsis.pitt.edu ) is provided. Reproducibility will be assessed at completion of two ongoing pediatric sepsis studies.",-1
"Emergence of Indian lineage of ECSA chikungunya virus in Djibouti, 2019","The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) originated from Africa and has spread worldwide. Since 2017, multiple chikungunya outbreaks have been reported in the Horn of Africa, without molecular characterization. In November 2019, an autochthonous acute chikungunya infection was diagnosed in a French patient living in Djibouti, marking the re-emergence of the virus in the country. The strain was isolated and fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Djiboutian strain belongs to the Indian lineage of the Eastern/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype. Two mutations highly increasing the virus's fitness in Aedes aegypti, the sole vector present in Djibouti city, were identified.",-1
Contralateral Recurrence of a Lumbar Juxtafacet Cyst Following Spontaneous Resolution,"We present a patient who had spontaneous resolution of a right L3/4 lumbar juxtafacet cyst (LJFC); and in whom, 2.5 years after regression of the previous cyst, a new contralateral L3/4 LJFC developed. Furthermore, with an extensive review, we discuss the selection criteria for patients for conservative treatment. A 44-year woman presented with right leg pain for two months. Neurological examination findings were normal; however, hypoesthesia was observed in right L4. There was no medical history of any trauma or a specific condition. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right L3/4 LJFC and L4/5 spondylolysis. The patient refused surgical treatment and was referred to a physical therapy department. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was administered for four weeks. At two months' follow-up, her leg pain was relieved. After 2.5 years, she was readmitted due to radiating left leg pain. The MRI showed regression of the previous right L3/4 LJFC and a newly formed left L3/4 LJFC. Thus, cyst excision and posterior fusion were performed. The symptoms were resolved immediately following the surgery and the patient continued to be symptom-free at a one-year follow-up. In the setting of significant instability, conservative treatment for LJFCs can still be beneficial; however, its role in preventing recurrence of LJFCs may be inadequate. In such patients, early surgical correction of instability may result in better long-term outcomes. Key Words: Degeneration, Juxtafacet cyst, Recurrence, Spinal instability, Spontaneous resolution.",-1
Fifty years after the eradication of Malaria in Italy. The long pathway toward this great goal and the current health risks of imported malaria,"Fifty years ago, Italy was declared a malaria-free country by the World Health Organization (WHO). In remembering this important anniversary, the authors of this paper describe the long journey that led to this goal. In the century following the unification of Italy, malaria was one of the main public health problems. At the end of the 19th century, malaria cases amounted to 2 million, with 15,000-20,000 deaths per year. This manuscript examines the state of public and social health in Italy from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, with particular regard to the government's measures for the prevention, prophylaxis and treatment of malaria. The authors describe the main findings of Italian malariologists during the period under review, from the identification of Plasmodium as a malaria pathogen and the recognition of the Anopheles mosquito as its vector. They also make some considerations regarding the current situation and the importation of malaria by travelers and migrants from countries where the disease is still endemic.",-1
Da Vinci Robot-Assisted Video Image Processing under Artificial Intelligence Vision Processing Technology,"This research was aimed to explore the application value of intelligent algorithm-based digital images in Da Vinci robot-assisted treatment of patients with gastric cancer surgery. 154 patients were included as the research objects, with 89 cases in the control group underwent laparoscopic surgery, and 65 cases in the experimental group underwent robotic surgery. According to the propensity score, the patients in two groups were pair matched (1: 1), of which 104 cases (52 cases in each group) were successfully matched. The general data of patients, the changes in the images before and after the algorithm processing, the intraoperative and postoperative conditions, the pathological examination results, and the follow-up information were observed after matching. Compared with the original images, the images processed by the thread image edge detection algorithm had the significantly improved clarity, as well as highly reduced artifacts and noises. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of image-assisted diagnosis were improved remarkably, showing the differences of statistical significance (P < 0.05). The total time of surgery, intraoperative bleeding, CRP (1d and 3d after surgery), and postoperative total abdominal drainage showed the significant differences as well (P < 0.05). The surgeries of patients in both groups met R0 resection (no tumor infiltration within 1 mm of the surgical margin), but there was a significant difference in the number of lymph node dissections (P < 0.05). The overall survival rates of patients in the experimental group and the control group were 83.0% and 76.1%, respectively, 2 years after surgery, with no significant difference (P > 0.05). The thread image edge detection algorithm produced a better processing effect on the images, which greatly improved the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Compared with endoscopic surgery, robotic surgery has better postoperative recovery, safety and reliability, and obvious advantages of minimally invasive surgery.",-1
Adipose tissue macrophages do not affect atherosclerosis development in mice,"Background and aims:                    Obese individuals have a higher risk of developing atherosclerosis, possibly driven by adipose tissue (AT) inflammation. We recently showed that AT macrophages (ATMs), which accumulate in the expanding obese AT, produce mediators causing immune cell recruitment from the bone marrow. In the current study, we evaluated whether ATMs are directly involved in atherosclerotic plaque development.              Methods:                    Lean ldlr-/- acceptor mice received visceral AT (vAT) from lean, obese, or ATM-depleted obese ldlr-/- mice. Acceptor mice were fed high cholesterol diet (HCD) for 4 weeks before and 8 weeks after AT transplantation to induce atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaque development was studied 8 weeks after transplantation.              Results:                    Transplanting donor vAT from obese mice increased circulating triglycerides and B-cells, but decreased Ly6c- monocytes. Plasma cholesterol, Ly6c+ monocytes, T-cells, NK-cells and eosinophils were unaffected. Depleting ATMs from obese AT using clodronate liposomes prior to vAT transplantation prevented the increase in triglycerides and B-cells and decrease in Ly6c- monocytes, but did increase eosinophils. Circulating Cxcl1 was reduced by obese AT transplantation and Ifn-Î³ tended to be increased while Tnf and Il-1Î² were unaffected. ATM-depleted obese AT transplantation also reduced Cxcl1, but increased circulating Tnf levels. However, obese AT transplantation with or without depletion of ATMs did not influence atherosclerotic plaque size, phenotype, or stability.              Conclusions:                    ATMs from obese vAT do not affect atherosclerotic plaque development or phenotype.",-1

Detection of balance disorders using rotations around vertical axis and an artificial neural network,"Vestibular impairments affect patients' movements and can result in difficulties with daily life activities. The main aim of this study is to answer the question whether a simple and short test such as rotation about a vertical axis can be an objective method of assessing balance dysfunction in patients with unilateral vestibular impairments. A 360Ë rotation test was performed using six MediPost devices. The analysis was performed in three ways: (1) the analytical approach based only on data from one sensor; (2) the analytical approach based on data from six sensors; (3) the artificial neural network (ANN) approach based on data from six sensors. For approaches 1 and 2 best results were obtained using maximum angular velocities (MAV) of rotation and rotation duration (RD), while approach 3 used 11 different features. The following sensitivities and specificities were achieved: for approach 1: MAV-80% and 60%, RD-69% and 74%; for approach 2: 61% and 85% and RD-74% and 56%; for approach 3: 88% and 84%. The ANN-based six-sensor approach revealed the best sensitivity and specificity among parameters studied, however one-sensor approach might be a simple screening test used e.g. for rehabilitation purposes.",-1
Circ_0043947 contributes to interleukin 1Î²-induced injury in chondrocytes by sponging miR-671-5p to up-regulate RTN3 expression in osteoarthritis pathology,"Objective:                    Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease featured by articular cartilage degeneration and damage. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated the pivotal regulatory roles of circular RNAs in OA pathology. However, the role of circ_0043947 in OA progression and its associated mechanism remain largely unknown.              Methods:                    The expression of RNA and protein was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assay. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell proliferation was analyzed by 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to analyze the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were performed to confirm the target interaction between microRNA-671-5p (miR-671-5p) and circ_0043947 or reticulon 3 (RTN3).              Results:                    Interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²) stimulation up-regulated the expression of circ_0043947 in chondrocytes. IL-1Î² treatment restrained the viability and proliferation and induced the apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation and inflammatory response of chondrocytes partly by up-regulating circ_0043947. Circ_0043947 interacted with miR-671-5p, and miR-671-5p silencing largely reversed circ_0043947 knockdown-mediated protective effects in IL-1Î²-induced chondrocytes. miR-671-5p interacted with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of RTN3. miR-671-5p overexpression attenuated IL-1Î²-induced injury in chondrocytes, and these protective effects were largely overturned by the overexpression of RTN3. Circ_0043947 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-671-5p to up-regulate RTN3 level in chondrocytes.              Conclusion:                    Circ_0043947 silencing alleviated IL-1Î²-induced injury in chondrocytes by targeting miR-671-5p/RTN3 axis.",-1
"Effects of chronic exposure to microcystin-LR on life-history traits, intestinal microbiota and transcriptomic responses in Chironomus pallidivittatus","Microcystins (MCs) are the most widely distributed cyanobacterial toxins that can exert adverse effects on aquatic organisms, but aside from the study of the harmful effect of cyanobacterial blooms, little is known about the effect of released MCs on the growth and development of chironomid larvae. To assess the harmful effect and the toxic mechanism of MCs on midges, the life-history traits, intestinal microbiota, and transcriptome of Chironomus pallidivittatus were analyzed after chronic exposure to 30 Î¼g/L of MC-LR. Exposure inhibited larvae body length by 35.61% and wet weight by 21.92%, increased emergence time of midges, damaged mitochondria in the intestine, promoted oxidative stress, dysregulated lipid metabolism of chironomid larvae, and increased detoxification enzymes glutathione S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 32.44% and 17.41%, respectively. Exposure also altered the diversity and abundance of the intestinal microbiota, favoring pathogenic and MC degradation bacteria. RNA sequencing identified 261 differentially expressed genes under MC-LR stress, suggesting that impairment of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway upregulated fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation to promote lipid accumulation. In addition, exposure-induced detoxification and antioxidant responses, indicating that the chironomid larvae had the potential ability to resist MC-LR. To our knowledge, this is the first time that lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and detoxification have been studied in this organism at the environmentally relevant concentration of MC-LR; the information may assist in ecological risk assessment of cyanobacterial toxins and their effects on benthic organisms.",-1
Determination of psychosocial factors in cluster headache - construction and psychometric properties of the Cluster Headache Scales (CHS),"Background:                    Cluster headache (CH) is clinically associated with considerable psychosocial burden. However, instruments to assess and characterize psychosocial factors in cluster headache more specifically are lacking. This study aimed to develop a self-report questionnaire, which assesses the broadest possible spectrum of psychosocial factors in cluster headache, the Cluster Headache Scales (CHS).              Method:                    Items of the Cluster Headache Scales were constructed based on a literature review and semi-structured interviews with several experts (including persons with cluster headache). A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to determine the psychometric properties and the factor structure of the Cluster Headache Scales. Data was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis as well as exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM).              Results:                    In total, n = 342 subjects with cluster headache (mean age 47.8, 63% male, 51% with episodic cluster headache) were included. Factor analysis yielded eight clearly interpretable factors: Medical care, medication side effects, fear of attacks, disability, (auto)aggression, coping, physical activity, and financial burden, which are assessed via 36 items. The internal consistencies of the subscales were acceptable to excellent and ranged between Cronbach's alpha = .76 and .93. The pattern of correlations with related instruments provides first evidence for convergent validity.              Conclusion:                    The CHS represents a reliable and valid self-report instrument for the assessment of psychosocial factors in persons with cluster headache, which appears useful for both clinical practice as well as research.Trial registration: The study was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de, ID-Number: DRKS00016502).",-1
Prediction and detection of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease from plantar pressure data using long short-term memory neural-networks,"Background:                    Freezing of gait (FOG) is a walking disturbance in advanced stage Parkinson's disease (PD) that has been associated with increased fall risk and decreased quality of life. Freezing episodes can be mitigated or prevented with external intervention such as visual or auditory cues, activated by FOG prediction and detection systems. While most research on FOG detection and prediction has been based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) and accelerometer data, plantar-pressure data may capture subtle weight shifts unique to FOG episodes. Different machine learning algorithms have been used for FOG detection and prediction; however, long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning methods hold an advantage when dealing with time-series data, such as sensor data. This research aimed to determine if LSTM can be used to detect and predict FOG from plantar pressure data alone, specifically for use in a real-time wearable system.              Methods:                    Plantar pressure data were collected from pressure-sensing insole sensors worn by 11 participants with PD as they walked a predefined freeze-provoking path. FOG instances were labelled, 16 features were extracted, and the dataset was balanced and normalized (z-score). The resulting datasets were classified using long short-term memory neural-network models. Separate models were trained for detection and prediction. For prediction models, data before FOG were included in the target class. Leave-one-freezer-out cross validation was used for model evaluation. In addition, the models were tested on all non-freezer data to determine model specificity.              Results:                    The best FOG detection model had 82.1% (SD 6.2%) mean sensitivity and 89.5% (SD 3.6%) mean specificity for one-freezer-held-out cross validation. Specificity improved to 93.3% (SD 4.0%) when ignoring inactive state data (standing) and analyzing the model only on active states (turning and walking). The model correctly detected 95% of freeze episodes. The best FOG prediction method achieved 72.5% (SD 13.6%) mean sensitivity and 81.2% (SD 6.8%) mean specificity for one-freezer-held-out cross validation.              Conclusions:                    Based on FOG data collected in a laboratory, the results suggest that plantar pressure data can be used for FOG detection and prediction. However, further research is required to improve FOG prediction performance, including training with a larger sample of people who experience FOG.",-1
Anthropometric measures and their association with risk factors for cardio-metabolic diseases in Kenyan adults,"Background:                    The prevalence of cardio-metabolic diseases (CMD) is drastically increasing worldwide. Anthropometric measures of fat accumulation are correlated with CMD and Metabolic Syndrome (MS), but few studies have addressed this association in sub-Saharan African populations.              Aim:                    To investigate the association between anthropometric features, MS and other CMD risk factors in a population from Kenya.              Subjects and methods:                    In this cross-sectional study including 1405 Kenyans, anthropometric measurements including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were carried out. Fasting blood glucose and standard oral glucose tolerance test, fasting serum insulin and plasma lipids were analysed. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance was calculated. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured.              Results:                    CMD risk factors and MS were associated with all anthropometric features, except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p < 0.05). The strongest association between MS and anthropometrics was seen with SAT (Î² = 1.45 Â± 0.32 in men and 0.88 Â± 0.14 in women, both p < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Anthropometric measures, especially features of central obesity such as VAT and SAT, are relevant indicators of cardio-metabolic health in Kenyan populations. SAT is the strongest predictor of MS. These results highlight the need for further research on the pathological implication of VAT and SAT, in order to understand patterns of fat distribution and cardio-metabolic health among different ethnic groups.",-1
"Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Annona squamosa L. seed extract: characterization, photocatalytic and biological activity assay","The aqueous seed extract of Annona squamosa L. was used as a reducing and stabilizing agent for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The formation of AgNPs in aqueous silver nitrate solution after the addition of the extract was indicated by a colour change from pale yellow to dark brown corresponding to a Î»max at 430 nm. The phytochemicals in the extract, responsible for efficient capping and stabilization of the nanoparticles, were identified by FTIR. Powder XRD pattern demonstrated the polycrystalline nature of the AgNPs. TEM image confirmed that AgNPs were spherical in shape and the average particle size was found to be 22 nm. Further, the nanoparticles exhibited good catalytic activity towards the degradation of coomassie brilliant blue dye and demonstrated significant antibacterial activity. Their larvicidal activity against mosquito larvae showed a LC50 value 22.44 Î¼g/mL against III instars. In addition, AgNPs positively influenced the germination of chickpea seeds.",-1
The associations between fasting plasma glucose levels and mortality of COVID-19 in patients without diabetes,"Aims:                    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is a novel pneumonia can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. It has appeared in 196 countries around the world. We aimed to clarify the associations between fasting plasma glucose levels and mortality of COVID-19 in patients without diabetes.              Methods:                    We performed a retrospective, single-center study of 151 patients without diabetes in Tongji Hospital from January 1, 2020 to February 28, 2020. Past medical histories, clinical features and laboratory parameters were collected in these patients.              Results:                    Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely to have underlying medical conditions including hypertension and chronic pulmonary diseases. Non-survivors had higher C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) levels, while lower lymphocyte counts as compared with those of survivors (all P<0.05). Besides, patients with higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) had higher IL-6, IL-8, CRP levels and mortality; while lower lymphocyte counts. After adjusting for age and gender, each tertile increment of FPG levels conferred 3.54-fold higher risks of death (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidential interval, 1.25-10.06, P=0.018).              Conclusions:                    Non-survivors combined with more comorbidities, more severe infection, and worse liver, kidney and cardiac function in patients without diabetes. Additionally, fasting plasma glucose levels were significantly associated with the risk of death in patients even with normal FPG and HbA1c levels.",-1
"Unfolded p53 as a Marker of Oxidative Stress in Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease","Aims:                    There are several candidate biomarkers for AD and PD which differ in sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, invasiveness, logistical and technical demands. This study is aimed to test whether plasma concentration of unfolded p53 may help to discriminate among the neurodegenerative processes occurring in Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.              Methods:                    An electrochemical immunosensor was used to measure unfolded p53 in plasma samples of 20 Mild Cognitive Impairment (13 males/7 females; mean age 74.95Â±5.31), 20 Alzheimer's (11 males/9 females; mean age: 77.25Â±7.79), 15 Parkinson's disease patients (12 males/3 females; mean age: 68.60 Â± 7.36) and its respective age/sex/studies-matched controls.              Results:                    We observed a significantly higher concentration of unfolded p53 in the plasma of patients of each of the three pathologies with respect to their control groups (p=0.000). Furthermore, the plasma concentration of unfolded p53 was significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease patients in comparison with Mild Cognitive Impairment patients (p=0.000) and Parkinson's disease patients (p=0.006). No significant difference between Mild Cognitive Impairment and Parkinson's disease patients was observed (p=0.524).              Conclusion:                    Our results suggest that unfolded p53 concentration in the plasma may be a useful biomarker for an undergoing neuropathological process that may be common, albeit with different intensity, to different diseases.",-1
Significance of a tumor microenvironment-mediated P65-miR-30a-5p-BCL2L11 amplification loop in multiple myeloma,"Despite significant progress in the treatment of myeloma, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable hematological malignancy due to cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) phenotype. However, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the CAM-DR remains scanty. Here, we identified a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in myeloma cells that are directly adherent to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Our data showed that the BMSCs up-regulated miR-30a-5p and down-regulated BCL2L11 at both mRNA and protein level in the myeloma cells. Besides, luciferase reporter genes demonstrated direct interaction between miR-30a-5p and BCL2L11 gene. Moreover, the BMSCs activated NF-ÎB signaling pathway in myeloma cells and the NF-ÎºB P65 was shown to directly bind the miR-30a-5p promoter region. Moreover, suppression of the miR-30a-5p or upregulation of the BCL2L11 promoted apoptosis of the myeloma cells independent of the BMSCs, thus suggesting clinical significance of miR-30a-5p inhibitor and PLBCL2L11 plasmid in CAM-DR. Together, our data demonstrated the role of P65-miR-30a-5p-BCL2L11 loop in CAM-DR myeloma cells. These findings give new insights into the role of tumor microenvironment in the treatment of patients with myeloma.",-1
Association of Differential Metabolites With Small Intestinal Microflora and Maternal Outcomes in Subclinical Hypothyroidism During Pregnancy,"Objective:                    To investigate the association of differential metabolites with small intestinal microflora and maternal outcomes in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) during pregnancy.              Methods:                    The plasma of pregnant women in the SCH group and control group was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), obtaining differential metabolites. Then, methane and hydrogen breath tests were performed in both groups, and basic clinical data and maternal outcome information were collected. Finally, differential metabolites were analyzed for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and pregnancy outcomes using Spearman correlation analysis.              Results:                    (1) Multivariate statistics: There were 564 different metabolites in positive ion mode and 226 different metabolites in negative ion mode. (2) The positive rate of the methane hydrogen breath test in the SCH group was higher than that in the control group (p<0.05). (3) KEGG pathway analysis revealed that differential metabolites were mainly involved in bile secretion, cholesterol metabolism, and other pathways. (4) Serum cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels and hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP) were higher in the SCH group (p<0.05), and newborn birth weight (BW) was lower than that in the control group (p<0.05). (5) SIBO was negatively correlated with glycocholic acid and BW, and positively correlated with TC. Glycocholic acid was negatively correlated with TG but positively correlated with BW. TG was positively correlated with HDCP.              Conclusion:                    Differential metabolites in the SCH group during pregnancy were disordered with small intestinal bacteria, which may affect pregnancy outcomes, and bile acids and cholesterol may be potential biomarkers for studying their mechanism of action.",-1
Blockade of the P2Y2 Receptor Attenuates Alcoholic Liver Inflammation by Targeting the EGFR-ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway,"Purpose:                    It is well known that inflammation plays a key role in complex pathological progressions of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). To date, effective therapy for ALD is lacking. P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R), a G protein-coupled P2Y purinergic receptor, represents a novel pharmacological target in many inflammations.              Methods:                    The alcohol-associated liver injury and inflammation mouse model was established. The effect of P2Y2R on alcohol-induced liver injury and inflammation was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical assay. An alcohol-stimulated (100 mmol/L, for 24 h) AML-12 cell model was established. Different agonists, antagonists and P2Y2R siRNA were used to explore the possible mechanisms of P2Y2R.              Results:                    In vivo, results showed that the hepatoprotective effect of P2Y2R blockade by significantly suppressed liver structural abnormalities and lipid infiltration, and decreased levels of ALT/AST and TNF-Î±/IL-1Î² in the high dosage group of suramin (20 mg/kg) compared to control diet (CD)-fed mice. At the same time, we found that alcohol feeding promoted the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2, both of which were effectively inhibited by suramin (20 mg/kg). In vitro, suramin or P2Y2R silencing effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK1/2, similar to the down-regulated effects of their corresponding inhibitors (EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126) accompanied by reduced levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² compared to alcohol-induced AML-12 cell. In addition, we found that silencing P2Y2R attenuated the apoptosis of hepatocyte.              Conclusion:                    Our findings suggest that P2Y2R regulates alcoholic liver inflammation by targeting the EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and plays an important role in hepatocyte apoptosis, which may provide new ideas for the development of methods to treat ALD.",-1
Suppression of PCSK9/NF-kB-dependent pathways by acetate ameliorates cardiac inflammation in a rat model of polycystic ovarian syndrome,"Aim:                    Endocrinometabolic disorders in women of reproductive age, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has contributed to increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and its attendant complications. Acetate, the most abundant endogenously produced short chain fatty acid has been linked to metabolic health. However, the impact of acetate on CVD-driven pathologies in PCOS is unknown. The present study therefore investigated the effects of acetate on cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with PCOS in rat model, and the possible involvement of PCSK9/NF-kB-dependent pathways.              Materials and methods:                    Eight-week-old female Wistar rats were allotted into four groups (n = 6) and the groups received vehicle, acetate (200 mg/kg), letrozole (1 mg/kg) and letrozole plus acetate respectively. The administrations were done once daily by oral gavage and lasted for 21 days.              Key findings:                    In letrozole-induced PCOS rats characterized with insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, elevated plasma testosterone and decreased 17-Î² estradiol as well as degenerated ovarian follicles, there was a significant increase in plasma and cardiac lipid/lipoproteins, lipid peroxidation, inflammatory mediators (NF-kB and TNF-Î±), Î³-glutamyl transferase/lactate dehydrogenase and lactate content, PCSK9 and reduction in plasma and cardiac antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione) and plasma nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS and NO) compared with the control rats. In addition, immunohistochemical assessment of cardiac tissue showed severe expression of inflammasome in letrozole-induced PCOS rats compared with the control rats. Nevertheless, supplementation with acetate significantly attenuated these alterations.              Significance:                    The present results suggest that acetate protects against cardiac inflammation in a rat model of PCOS by suppression of PCSK9 and NF-kB-dependent mechanisms.",-1
The Cell Surface Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan Syndecan-3 Promotes Ovarian Cancer Pathogenesis,"Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that integrate signaling at the cell surface. By interacting with cytokines, signaling receptors, proteases, and extracellular matrix proteins, syndecans regulate cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. We analyzed public gene expression datasets to evaluate the dysregulation and potential prognostic impact of Syndecan-3 in ovarian cancer. Moreover, we performed functional in vitro analysis in syndecan-3-siRNA-treated SKOV3 and CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells. In silico analysis of public gene array datasets revealed that syndecan-3 mRNA expression was significantly increased 5.8-fold in ovarian cancer tissues (n = 744) and 3.4-fold in metastases (n = 44) compared with control tissue (n = 46), as independently confirmed in an RNAseq dataset on ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma tissue (n = 374, controls: n = 133, 3.5-fold increase tumor vs. normal). Syndecan-3 siRNA knockdown impaired 3D spheroid growth and colony formation as stemness-related readouts in SKOV3 and CAOV3 cells. In SKOV3, but not in CAOV3 cells, syndecan-3 depletion reduced cell viability both under basal conditions and under chemotherapy with cisplatin, or cisplatin and paclitaxel. While analysis of the SIOVDB database did not reveal differences in Syndecan-3 expression between patients, sensitive, resistant or refractory to chemotherapy, KM Plotter analysis of 1435 ovarian cancer patients revealed that high syndecan-3 expression was associated with reduced survival in patients treated with taxol and platin. At the molecular level, a reduction in Stat3 activation and changes in the expression of Wnt and notch signaling constituents were observed. Our study suggests that up-regulation of syndecan-3 promotes the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer by modulating stemness-associated pathways.",-1

Metabolic and Microbial Changes Associated With Diet and Obesity During Pregnancy: What Can We Learn From Animal Studies?,"The intestinal microbiota changes throughout pregnancy and influences maternal metabolic adaptations to support fetal growth. Obesity induces alterations to the microbiota that include decreased microbial diversity and shifts in microbial composition, though specific species changes are inconsistent between published studies. In animal models, probiotics and exercise moderate maternal weight gain and partially correct the maternal microbiota. Supplemental Escherichia coli, however, exacerbate maternal obesity during the perinatal period, lending weight to the theory that inflammation-induced gut epithelial barrier leak influences metabolic dysregulation. Although birth weight is not always altered when offspring are exposed to an obesogenic diet during gestation, insulin resistance and lipid metabolism are impacted through adulthood in association with this exposure and can lead to increased body weight in adulthood. Postnatal offspring growth is accelerated in response to maternal overnutrition during lactation. Offspring microbiota, metabolism, and behavior are altered in response to early exposure to high fat and high sucrose diets. Consequences to this exposure include impaired glucose and insulin homeostasis, fatty liver, and neurobehavioral deficits that can be ameliorated by improving the microbial environment. In this mini review, we provide an overview of the use of translational animal models to understand the mechanisms associated with changes to the gastrointestinal microbiota due to maternal obesity and the microbial impact on the metabolic changes of pregnancy.",-1
"The triglyceride/glucose ratio is a reliable index of fasting insulin resistance: Observations from hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies in young, normoglycaemic males from southern India","Background & aims:                    Non-obese Asians have a high propensity to develop insulin resistance. Therefore, screening such individuals for insulin resistance using simple surrogate indices is important. In this study, we aimed to validate the triglyceride-glucose (Tg/glu) ratio against the M value of hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (HEC) procedure and other surrogate indices of insulin resistance in normoglycaemic Indian males from Southern India.              Methods:                    A cohort of 105 normoglycaemic males (mean BMI: 19.2 Â± 2.6 kg/m2) underwent HEC procedure. Surrogate indices of insulin resistance viz. the triglyceride-glucose (Tg/Glu) ratio, the triglyceride-glucose index, the McAuley's index, the HOMA-IR, the QUICKI, the fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FG-IR), and the fasting C- peptide index were calculated and correlated with the M value. The cut-off value for the Tg/Glu ratio was obtained using the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) with Area under curve (AUC) analysis at 95% confidence interval (CI). The P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.              Results:                    The Tg/Glu ratio demonstrated significantly higher AUC (0.81), when compared to the Tg Ã glu index (0.63), 20/fasting C peptide Ã fasting plasma glucose index (0.55), HOMA-IR (0.47), QUICKI (0.26), FGIR (0.12) and McAuley's index (0.18). For the Tg/Glu ratio, a cut-off value â?1.19 had high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (79%) values (PPV: 16%; NPV: 98.8%) respectively.              Conclusion:                    The Tg/Glu ratio can be used as a reliable surrogate index to screen for risk of insulin resistance in lean, normoglycaemic males from Southern India.",-1
Understanding the pathways leading to gut dysbiosis and enteric environmental dysfunction in infants: the influence of maternal dysbiosis and other microbiota determinants during early life,"Maternal environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) encompasses undernutrition with an inflammatory gut profile, a variable degree of dysbiosis and increased translocation of pathogens in the gut mucosa. Even though recent research findings have shed light on the pathological pathways underlying the establishment of the infant gut dysbiosis, evidence on how maternal EED influences the development of gut dysbiosis and EED in the offspring remains elusive. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the effect of maternal dysbiosis and EED on infant health, and explores recent progress in unraveling the mechanisms of acquisition of a dysbiotic gut microbiota in the offspring. In Western communities, maternal inoculum, delivery mode, perinatal antibiotics, feeding practices and infections are the major drivers of the infant gut microbiota during the first 2 years of life. In other latitudes, the infectious burden and maternal malnutrition might introduce further risk factors for infant gut dysbiosis. Novel tools, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, have become indispensable to analyze the metabolic environment of the infant in utero and postpartum. Human milk oligosaccharides have essential prebiotic, antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties that might offer additional therapeutic opportunities.",-1
"Immune dysfunction induced by 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, an emerging water disinfection byproduct, due to the defects of host-microbiome interactions","2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ), as an emerging water disinfection byproducts (DBPs), has posed potential risks via the digestion system. However, little is known about the toxicity of DCBQ on the gut microbiome, which plays a critical role on human health. This study has comprehensively investigated the impact of DCBQ on the intestinal microbiome, metabolic functions, and immunity after the mice orally exposure to DCBQ at the concentration of 31.25, 62.5 and 125 mg/kg body weight for 28 days. Our results indicated that DCBQ exposure has perturbed the balance between T helper (Th) 1 mediated pro-inflammatory response and Th2 mediated anti-inflammatory response in mice, especially inducing the activation of immune system toward a Th2 response. DCBQ group has induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, and at phylum level, Proteobacteria was relatively less abundant compared with that in the control group. Furthermore, DCBQ exposure has dramatically perturbed metabolites profiles which were involved in 28 metabolic pathways, such as amino acids biosynthesis and metabolism, lipid metabolism. In particular, the altered gut microbiota showed strong correlations with both the altered metabolites and the altered immunological variables after DCBQ exposure. This study provides evidence on the adverse effects and mechanisms of water disinfection byproduct DCBQ through the interaction of immune-microbiome-metabolome, highlighting the importance to assess DBPs-associated risks.",-1
The Influence of Maternal Vitamin E Concentrations in Different Trimesters on Gestational Diabetes and Large-for-Gestational-Age: A Retrospective Study in China,"Vitamin E can protect pregnant women from oxidative stress and further affect pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to investigate maternal vitamin E concentration in each trimester and its associations with gestational diabetes (GDM) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA). The data were derived from Peking University Retrospective Birth Cohort in Tongzhou, collected from 2015 to 2018 (n = 19,647). Maternal serum vitamin E were measured from blood samples collected in each trimester. Logistic regressions were performed to analyze the association between maternal vitamin E levels and outcomes. The median levels of maternal vitamin E increased from the first (10.00 mg/L) to the third (16.00 mg/L) trimester. Among mothers who had inadequate vitamin E levels, most of them had excessive amounts. Excessive vitamin E level in the second trimester was a risk factor for GDM (aOR = 1.640, 95% CI: 1.316-2.044) and LGA (aOR = 1.334, 95% CI: 1.022-1.742). Maternal vitamin E concentrations in the first and second trimesters were positively associated with GDM (first: aOR = 1.056, 95% CI: 1.038-1.073; second: aOR = 1.062, 95% CI: 1.043-1.082) and LGA (first: aOR = 1.030, 95% CI: 1.009-1.051; second: aOR = 1.040, 95% CI: 1.017-1.064). Avoiding an excess of vitamin E during pregnancy might be an effective measure to reduce GDM and LGA. Studies to explore the potential mechanisms are warranted.",-1
Pre- and Post-publication Verification for Reproducible Data Mining in Macromolecular Crystallography,"Like an article narrative is deemed by an editor and referees to be worthy of being a version of record on acceptance as a publication, so must the underpinning data also be scrutinized before passing it as a version of record. Indeed without the underpinning data, a study and its conclusions cannot be reproduced at any stage of evaluation, pre- or post-publication. Likewise, an independent study without its own underpinning data also cannot be reproduced let alone be considered a replicate of the first study. The PDB is a modern marvel of achievement providing an organized open access to depositor and user of the data held there opening numerous applications. Methods for modeling protein structures and for determination of structures are still improving their precision, and artifacts of the method exist. So their accuracy is realized if they are reproduced by other methods. It is on such foundations that reproducible data mining is based. Data rates are expanding considerably be they at synchrotrons, the X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs), electron cryomicroscopes (cryoEM), or at the neutron facilities. The work of a person as a referee or user with a narrative and its underpinning data may well be complemented in future by artificial intelligence with machine learning, the former for specific refereeing and the latter for the more general validation, both ideally before publication. Examples are described involving rhenium theranostics, the anti-cancer platins and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.",-1
Simultaneous Employment of the FRAIL Scale and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator May Identify Elderly People Who Require Different Interventional Strategies,"Purpose:                    Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that is usually considered as a set of physical deficits (unidimensional concept)ï»? however, it can also concern the psychological and social domains of human functioning (multidimensional concept). The FRAIL scale is a diagnostic tool which ascertains only physical frailty, whereas the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) is a diagnostic instrument for multidimensional frailty. The study investigates if non-robust physical status and multidimensional frailty affect the same individuals and whether simultaneous employment of the FRAIL scale and TFI identifies specific subgroups of elderly people which require different interventions.              Patients and methods:                    In this cross-sectional study, 1024 community dwelling elderly individuals at the age of 65 years or older (mean age 72.6 Â± 6.3 years; range 65-93 years) were evaluated with the FRAIL scale and TFI.              Results:                    According to the FRAIL scale, 52.9% of the subjects were physically non-robust, but according to TFI, 54.6% presented multidimensional frailty. These two diagnostic tools were concordant in their outcomes in 77.1% (ie, 42.3% of individuals were physically and multidimensionally frail but 34.8% were robust according to both two instruments)ï»? however, in 22.9% the outcomes were discordant. Consequently, by simultaneous employment of the FRAIL scale and TFI, four distinct functional categories have been distinguished: (i) non-robust physical status with multidimensional frailty, (ii) exclusive non-robust physical status, (iii) exclusive multidimensional frailty, and (iv) full robust status.              Conclusion:                    By applying simple physical and multidimensional frailty diagnostic tools, subgroups of elderly people may be identified that require specific management strategies to improve their functional status.",-1
[Identification of rare variants in exons of NLRC4 gene in patients with type 1 diabetes and their impact on gene function],"Objective: To identify rare variants in exon and exon-intron boundary of containing NLR family CARD domain protein 4 (NLRC4) in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) patients, and to explore their effects on gene function. Methods: A total of 508 T1DM patients and 527 healthy controls in the Department of Metabolic Endocrinology, Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from August 2017 to September 2020 were selected. The case group included 264 males and 244 females, and the age [M (Q1, Q3)] was [27 (11, 43)] years. The control group included 290 males and 237 females, and their ageï¼»Mï¼Q1ï¼Q3ï¼ï¼½was [47 (36, 60)] years old. Identification of rare variants in exons of NLRC4 gene in T1DM patients and healthy controls was performed and verified by next-generation sequencing and sanger sequencing. The NLRC4 gene wild-type and mutant plasmids were constructed and transfected into 293T cells. Western blot (WB) was used to detect the expression of NLRC4 protein and cleavage products of pro-cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase(procaspase-1). Cycloheximide (CHX) was added to 293T cells transfected with wild-type or mutant NLRC4 plasmid to detect the degradation of NLRC4 protein. The localization of NLRC4 protein was detected by immunofluorescence, and the concentration of IL-1Î² in the cell supernatant was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The sequencing results showed that 4 patients and 2 healthy controls had a heterozygous variant c.208C>T in exon 3 of the NLRC4 gene. Two patient had a heterozygous variant c.1564T>C in exon 4, and 1 patients had c.1219G>C in exon 4. These three variants might be pathogenic variants in T1DM. In 293T cells transfected with NLRC4 wild-type and c.208C>Tãc.1564T>Cc.1219G>C mutant plasmids, the expression level, degradation rate, localization of NLRC4 protein and the content of cleavage products of procaspase-1 did not change significantly. However, the concentration of IL-1Î² secreted by 293T cells transfected with c.1219G>C and c.208C>T plasmid [M(Q1, Q3)] was 15.25 (12.98, 17.52) and 15.44 (13.81, 17.07) ng/L, respectively, which was lower than 18.70 (16.59, 20.81) ng/L of 293T cells transfected wild-type plasmid (P=0.020, 0.010). Conclusions: NLRC4 gene rare variants c.208C>T, c.1564T>C and c.1219G>C may not change the protein expression, degradation and localization, but c.208C>T and c.1219G>C may inhibit the secretion of IL-1Î². This result suggests that NLRC4 rare variants may have an impact on gene function.",-1
"Trends in the Prevalence of Cardiometabolic Multimorbidity in the United States, 1999-2018","Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (co-existence of â? cardiometabolic diseases) is increasingly common, while its prevalence in the U.S. is unknown. We utilized data from 10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) two-year cycles in U.S. adults from 1999 to 2018. We reported the age-standardized prevalence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity in 2017-2018 and analyzed their trends during 1999-2018 with joinpoint regression models. Stratified analyses were performed according to gender, age, and race/ethnicity. In 2017-2018, the prevalence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity was 14.4% in the U.S., and it was higher among male, older, and non-Hispanic Black people. The three most common patterns were hypertension and diabetes (7.5%); hypertension, diabetes, and CHD (2.2%); and hypertension and CHD (1.8%). During 1999-2018, the prevalence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity in U.S. adults increased significantly, with an averaged two-year cycle percentage change (AAPC) of 3.6 (95% CI: 2.1 to 5.3). The increasing trend was significant for both genders, most age groups except for 60-79 years, and non-Hispanic White people. For common patterns, the trend was increasing for hypertension and diabetes and hypertension, diabetes, and CHD, while it was decreasing for hypertension and CHD. Our findings provide evidence that cardiometabolic multimorbidity has risen as an austere issue of public health in the U.S.",-1
Bioequivalence Study of Amitriptyline Hydrochloride Tablets in Healthy Chinese Volunteers Under Fasting and Fed Conditions,"Purpose:                    This study compares the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles between a new generic and a branded reference formulation of amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets, and assesses the bioequivalence of the two products in healthy Chinese volunteers to obtain sufficient evidence for the marketing approval of the generic drug.              Materials and methods:                    A randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03646526) was conducted under both fasting and fed conditions in healthy Chinese volunteers (24 subjects/condition). Eligible subjects randomly received a single 25 mg dose of either the test or the reference formulation, followed by a 3-week washout period. Blood samples were collected until 144 h following administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters were acquired based on the concentration-time profiles, including the areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-t, AUC0-â?, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax), the time to achieve Cmax (Tmax), and the elimination half-life (t1/2). The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of amitriptyline were acquired for bioequivalence analysis, and values of these parameters for nortriptyline were used for comparison of therapeutic outcomes. Safety assessments included laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs, and incidence of adverse events (AEs).              Results:                    The values of t1/2 and Tmax for amitriptyline were not significantly different between the test and reference products under both fasting and fed conditions (P > 0.05). The GMRs of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-â?between the two products, and corresponding 90% CIs, were all within the range of 80% to 125% under both fasting and fed conditions. The test and reference products were well tolerated and did not elicit serious adverse events.              Conclusion:                    This study demonstrated that the generic and reference products were well tolerated by the subjects and bioequivalent, according to the rate and extent of the drug absorption.",-1
Time-restricted feeding alters lipid and amino acid metabolite rhythmicity without perturbing clock gene expression,"Time-restricted feeding (TRF) improves metabolism independent of dietary macronutrient composition or energy restriction. To elucidate mechanisms underpinning the effects of short-term TRF, we investigated skeletal muscle and serum metabolic and transcriptomic profiles from 11 men with overweight/obesity after TRF (8 h day-1) and extended feeding (EXF, 15 h day-1) in a randomised cross-over design (trial registration: ACTRN12617000165381). Here we show that muscle core clock gene expression was similar after both interventions. TRF increases the amplitude of oscillating muscle transcripts, but not muscle or serum metabolites. In muscle, TRF induces rhythmicity of several amino acid transporter genes and metabolites. In serum, lipids are the largest class of periodic metabolites, while the majority of phase-shifted metabolites are amino acid related. In conclusion, short-term TRF in overweight men affects the rhythmicity of serum and muscle metabolites and regulates the rhythmicity of genes controlling amino acid transport, without perturbing core clock gene expression.",-1
Effects of short-term fasting on ruminal pH and volatile fatty acids in cattle fed high-roughage versus high-concentrate diets,"We evaluated whether the dietary roughage-to-concentrate ratio affects ruminal pH and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in response to a one-time morning fast. Four healthy rumen-cannulated Holstein steers 4-5 months old were used. Cattle were subjected to 2 weeks of adaptation (high-roughage or high-concentrate diet), and morning feed restriction was performed on the day after the adaptation period ended (Day 0). Thereafter, each diet was reintroduced on the evening of Day 0. Our results showed that the 1-hr mean ruminal pH from 0800 to 1900 on Day 0 was higher, and that from 1700 to 1900 on Day 1 was lower (P<0.05) than pH on 1 day before fasting (Day -1) in cattle fed both diets. On Day 0, total VFA levels decreased after morning fasting and were lower (P<0.05) than those on Day -1 irrespective of evening refeeding. Furthermore, blood non-esterified fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid levels on Day 0 increased and decreased, respectively, compared to Day -1 in cattle fed both diets. These results indicate that even a one-time feed restriction can disrupt ruminal fermentation, and the changes can persist to the next day after fasting.",-1
Circ_0041732 regulates tumor properties of triple-negative breast cancer cells by the miR-149-5p/FGF5 pathway,"Background:                    Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancers with a high recurrence and mortality. The important factors promoting the TNBC process have not been fully identified. In this research, the role of a TNBC-related circular RNA (circRNA), circ_0041732, was revealed in TNBC cell tumor properties.              Methods:                    The expression levels of circ_0041732, microRNA-149-5p (miR-149-5p) and fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis or immunohistochemistry assay. Cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 and cell colony formation assays. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity assays. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. Cell angiogenic capacity was investigated by a tube formation assay. The targeting relationship between miR-149-5p and circ_0041732 or FGF5 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. The impacts of circ_0041732 knockdown on tumor formation were determined by an in vivo assay.              Results:                    Circ_0041732 and FGF5 expression were significantly upregulated, whereas miR-149-5p was downregulated in TNBC tissues and cells compared with normal breast tissues and cells, respectively. Circ_0041732 silencing inhibited TNBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation, but induced apoptosis. Additionally, circ_0041732 regulated TNBC cell tumor properties by binding to miR-149-5p. MiR-149-5p also modulated TNBC cell tumor properties by targeting FGF5. Furthermore, circ_0041732 knockdown hindered tumor formation in vivo.              Conclusion:                    Circ_0041732 silencing suppressed TNBC cell tumor properties by decreasing FGF5 expression through miR-149-5p. This finding demonstrated that circ_0041732 had the potential as a therapeutic target for TNBC.",-1
Inflammation and atherosclerosis: signaling pathways and therapeutic intervention,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory vascular disease driven by traditional and nontraditional risk factors. Genome-wide association combined with clonal lineage tracing and clinical trials have demonstrated that innate and adaptive immune responses can promote or quell atherosclerosis. Several signaling pathways, that are associated with the inflammatory response, have been implicated within atherosclerosis such as NLRP3 inflammasome, toll-like receptors, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, Notch and Wnt signaling pathways, which are of importance for atherosclerosis development and regression. Targeting inflammatory pathways, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and its regulated inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Î², could represent an attractive new route for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases. Herein, we summarize the knowledge on cellular participants and key inflammatory signaling pathways in atherosclerosis, and discuss the preclinical studies targeting these key pathways for atherosclerosis, the clinical trials that are going to target some of these processes, and the effects of quelling inflammation and atherosclerosis in the clinic.",-1
Impact of bacterial infection and intestinal microbiome on colorectal cancer development,"Accumulating evidence suggests that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Due to the complexity of the intestinal microbiome, identification of the specific causative microbial agents in CRC remains challenging, and the search for the causative microbial agents is intense. However, whether bacteria or their products can induce inflammation that results in tumorigenesis or directly causes CRC in humans is still not clear. This review will mainly focus on the progress of bacterial infection and CRC, and introduce the microbial contribution to the hallmarks of cancer. This article uses Salmonella and its chronic infection as an example to investigate a single pathogen and its role in the development of CRC, based on laboratory and epidemiological evidence. The bacterial infection leads to an altered intestinal microbiome. The review also discusses the dysfunction of the microbiome and the mechanism of host-microbial interactions, for example, bacterial virulence factors, key signaling pathways in the host, and microbial post-translational modifications in the tumorigenesis. Colonic carcinogenesis involves a progressive accumulation of mutations in a genetically susceptible host leading to cellular autonomy. Moving forward, more human data are needed to confirm the direct roles of bacterial infection in CRC development. Insights into the inhibiting infection will help to prevent cancer and develop strategies to restore the balance between host and microorganisms.",-1
Pathogenicity and virulence of West Nile virus revisited eight decades after its first isolation,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus which transmission cycle is maintained between mosquitoes and birds, although it occasionally causes sporadic outbreaks in horses and humans that can result in serious diseases and even death. Since its first isolation in Africa in 1937, WNV had been considered a neglected pathogen until its recent spread throughout Europe and the colonization of America, regions where it continues to cause outbreaks with severe neurological consequences in humans and horses. Although our knowledge about the characteristics and consequences of the virus has increased enormously lately, many questions remain to be resolved. Here, we thoroughly update our knowledge of different aspects of the WNV life cycle: virology and molecular classification, host cell interactions, transmission dynamics, host range, epidemiology and surveillance, immune response, clinical presentations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prophylaxis (antivirals and vaccines), and prevention, and we highlight those aspects that are still unknown and that undoubtedly require further investigation.",-1
Association Between Long-Term Regular Exercise and Gut Microbiota Among Middle-Aged and Older Urban Chinese,"Increasing evidence has suggested that physical activity may modulate gut microbiome composition. We investigated associations of long-term regular exercise with gut microbiota among middle-aged and older urban Chinese individuals. Gut microbiota was assessed using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing of stool samples from 2,151 participants from the Shanghai Women's Health Study and Shanghai Men's Health Study. Participants were free of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases at the time of stool sample collection. Physical activity was assessed in repeat surveys between 1996 and 2015 using validated questionnaires. Regular exercise was defined as any type of leisure-time physical activity with a standard metabolic equivalent score >3.0. Stool samples were collected using the 95% ethanol method between 2015 and 2018 with an average of 3.0 years (SD = 0.9) after the latest exposure assessment. General linear regression and permutational multivariate analysis of variance were carried out to evaluate associations of microbial Î±- and Î²-diversity with regular exercise participation. Logistic regression and linear regression models were used to evaluate the prevalence and relative abundance of individual taxa in association with regular exercise. Regular exercise was significantly associated with Î²-diversity (Bray-Curtis and Jaccard dissimilarities, both false discovery rates = 0.03%, 0.12% and 0.09% variance explained, respectively) but not with Î±-diversity. Relative abundance of genus Ruminococcus was significantly lower among regular exercisers compared with nonexercisers (median relative abundance: 0.64% vs. 0.81%, false discovery rate <0.10). Further studies are needed to validate the findings from this study and evaluate health benefits of regular exercise on gut microbiota.",-1
Human Visceral Adipose Tissue Macrophages Are Not Adequately Defined by Standard Methods of Characterization,"Obesity is associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation both systemically and within specific tissues, including adipose tissue (AT). In murine models of obesity, there is a shift in the inflammatory profile of the AT immune cells, with an accumulation of proinflammatory M1 macrophages that surround the expanding adipocyte. However, much less is known about the immune cell composition and how to best define AT macrophages in humans. Objective. The goals of the current study were to determine the contribution of macrophages to the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in lean versus obese human visceral AT (VAT); examine the expression of common M1, M2, and pan macrophage markers; and determine the association of specific macrophage types with known biomarkers of obesity-related cardiometabolic disease. Research Design and Methods. VAT biopsies were obtained from obese (n = 50) and lean (n = 8) patients during elective surgery. Adipocytes and SVF were isolated, and the SVF was subjected to flow cytometry analyses. Results. Our results indicate that VAT macrophages are increased in obesity and associate with biomarkers of CVD but that many macrophages do not fall into currently defined M1/M2 classification system based on CD206 receptor expression levels. Conclusions. VAT macrophages are increased in obese subjects, but the current markers used to define macrophage populations are inadequate to distinguish differences in human obesity. Further studies are needed to delineate the function of AT macrophages in the maintenance and progression of human AT inflammation in obesity.",-1
"Sensitive, Highly Stable, and Anti-Fouling Electrode with Hexanethiol and Poly-A Modification for Exosomal microRNA Detection","It remains a huge challenge to integrate the sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and anti-fouling ability of electrochemical biosensors for practical applications. Herein, we propose a self-assembled electrode combining hexanethiol (HT), poly-adenine (poly-A), and cholesteryl-modified DNA to meet this challenge. HT can tightly pack at the electrode interface to form a hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer (SAM), effectively improving the stability and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of electrochemical detection. Cholesteryl-modified DNA was immobilized at the electrode through the hydrophobic interaction with HT to avoid the competition between the SAM and the DNA probe on the gold site. Thus, the assembly efficiency and uniformity of the DNA probe as well as the detection reproducibility were increased remarkedly. Poly-A was added on the HT assembled electrode to occupy the unreacted sites of gold to further enhance the anti-fouling ability. The combination of HT and poly-A allows the electrode to ensure favorable anti-fouling ability without sacrificing the detection performance. On this basis, we proposed a dual-signal amplification electrochemical biosensor for the detection of exosomal microRNAs, which showed excellent sensitivity with a detection limit down to 1.46 aM. Importantly, this method has been successfully applied to detect exosomal microRNA-21 in cells and human serum samples, proving its potential utility in cancer diagnosis.",-1
Atorvastatin and Fenofibrate Exert Opposite Effects on the Vascularization and Characteristics of Visceral Adipose Tissue in New Zealand White Rabbits,"Statins may precipitate the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk patients. In contrast, only the subset of individuals with insulin resistance and/or diabetes receives cardiovascular benefits with fibrates. In this context, previous observations from our laboratory suggested that atorvastatin induced an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), whereas fenofibrate had the opposite effects in rabbits. Therefore, we determined the mass, morphology, and vascularization of VAT in New Zealand white rabbits (n = 6/group) that received 0.33 or 2.6 mg/kg/d of atorvastatin or fenofibrate, respectively, during 2 months. As expected, the cholesterol from the atorvastatin group was lower after treatment, while triglycerides decreased in the fenofibrate group. The mass of VAT from the fenofibrate group was 46% lower compared to the controls, meanwhile atorvastatin was associated with a larger diameter of adipocytes (+65%) than that of the control and fenofibrate groups. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) gene expression was lower in the fenofibrate group than in the control group (-54%). By contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) gene expression in fenofibrate-treated rabbits was 110% higher than in the control group. In agreement with the gene expression, the marker of angiogenesis platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 was slightly but significantly higher (+10%) in rabbits treated with fenofibrate than in controls, as determined by immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that fenofibrate is associated with a favorable remodeling of VAT, that is, reduced mass and increased vascularization in normolipemic rabbits; in contrast, atorvastatin induced a nonfavorable remodeling of VAT. These results may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of fenofibrate and the increased risk of T2D in high-risk patients induced by atorvastatin.",-1
Sex Differences in Demand for Highly Palatable Foods: Role of the Orexin System,"Background:                    The prevalence of eating disorders, including binge eating disorder, is significantly higher in women. These findings are mirrored by preclinical studies, which indicate that female rats have a higher preference for palatable food and show greater binge-like eating compared with male rats.              Methods:                    Here, we describe a novel within-session behavioral-economic paradigm that allows for the simultaneous measurement of the intake at null cost (Q0) and normalized demand elasticity (Î±) of 3 types of palatable food (low fat, high fat, and chocolate sucrose pellets) via demand curve analysis. In light of evidence that the orexin (hypocretin) system is critically involved in reward and feeding behaviors, we also examined the role of orexin function in sex differences of economic demand for palatable foods.              Results:                    The novel within-session behavioral-economic approach revealed that female rats have higher intake (demand) than males for all palatable foods at low cost (normalized to body weight) but no difference in intake at higher prices, indicating sex-dependent differences in the hedonic, but not motivational, aspects of palatable food. Immediately following behavioral-economic testing, we observed more orexin-expressing neurons and Fos expression (measure of recent neural activation) in these neurons in female rats compared with male rats. Moreover, the orexin-1 receptor antagonist SB334867 reduced both low- and high-cost intake for palatable food in both male and female rats.              Conclusions:                    These findings provide evidence of higher demand at low prices for palatable food in females and indicate that these behavioral differences may be associated with sexual dimorphism in orexin system function.",-1
Association of pulse wave velocity with body fat measures at 30 y of age,"Objectives:                    Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an early marker of arterial stiffness and a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Body fat measures, such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and visceral fat, have been associated with CVD in adulthood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of PWV at 30 y of age using body fat measures.              Methods:                    In 1982, the maternity hospitals in Pelotas, Brazil, were visited daily and all live births were identified. These infants have been prospectively followed several times. At 30 y, we tried to follow the cohort; the individuals were interviewed and had PWV, anthropometric parameters, abdominal fat, and visceral fat measured.              Results:                    The present study included 1576 individuals. PWV was highly correlated with BMI, WC, visceral fat thickness, and fat mass compared with other body composition measures. In linear regression analysis, the highest regression coefficients were observed for BMI (r = 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.35), visceral fat thickness (r = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.24-0.35), and fat mass (r = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.24-0.35), even after controlling for potential confounders (sex, race, birth weight, family income, family education, and maternal smoking during pregnancy).              Conclusion:                    In the present study, BMI, visceral fat thickness, and fat mass were the strongest body fat measures related to PWV.",-1
Visualization and Analysis Model of Industrial Economy Status and Development Based on Knowledge Graph and Deep Neural Network,"This paper adopts knowledge mapping combined with a deep neural network algorithm to conduct in-depth research and analysis on the current situation and development of the industrial economy and designs a visual analysis model of economic development based on knowledge mapping combined with a deep neural network algorithm. Cultivate the concept of coordinated development and legal system of the subject, improve the awareness of network security and integrity self-discipline of the subject, improve the level of network hardware equipment manufacturing, improve the level of network platform construction, build a network security technology prevention system, improve the repair system of network information alienation, set up a specialized agency setting for the coordinated development of network ecology and industrial economy, and increase the capital investment in network infrastructure and network information technology research and development. A framework of breadth and depth recommendation ranking based on a knowledge graph is proposed and implemented. This paper provides a visual analysis method to sort and classify multivariate data. The method first determines users' preferences through their interactive operations, calculates the weights of each attribute according to the users' preference model, then uses the obtained attribute weight sets to sort the whole data set, and finally completes the category classification according to the sorting results and the users' markings on some data. The visual display allows users to intuitively perform data sorting and classification operations and quickly understand the characteristics and category features of the data. The framework achieves modeling and integration of knowledge graph neighborhood information from breadth dimension and depth dimension to realize personalized recommendation sorting and improves the F1 metrics by 8.59%, 14.36%, and 15.22% on the public datasets Amazon-book, Yelp2018, and ILast-FM compared with the previous optimal model.",-1
tDCS application for postural control in Parkinson's disease: Effects are associated with baseline characteristics,"Introduction:                    Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves postural response to perturbation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). However, the influence of baseline characteristics such as clinical/cognitive and postural performance on the response to tDCS remains unclear.              Objective:                    To investigate whether baseline level of postural control (performance during sham condition) and clinical/cognitive characteristics are associated with tDCS-related changes in postural responses to external perturbations in PwPD.              Methods:                    Twenty-four PwPD participated in this study. Clinical assessment included disease severity, disease duration, levodopa equivalent dose and global cognition. Anodal tDCS protocols targeting the primary motor cortex were applied in two separate sessions (at least 2 weeks apart): active (2 mA for 20 min) and sham stimulation. Seven trials with the backward translation of the support base (20 cm/s and 5 cm) were performed after tDCS. Postural outcomes included the recovery time to stable position and onset latency of the medial gastrocnemius (MG). Pearson and Spearman correlation tests were performed.              Results:                    No significant correlations were observed between clinical/cognitive characteristics and tDCS-related changes in postural responses. Negative associations were observed between the baseline level of postural control and tDCS-related changes in postural responses for the recovery time (r = -0.657; p < 0.001) and the MG onset latency (rs = -0.539; p = 0.007). PwPD with worse baseline postural control demonstrated greater improvement after active stimulation.              Conclusions:                    Findings suggest that tDCS-related effects on postural response to perturbation are related to the baseline level of postural control, but not to clinical characteristics in PwPD. Those with worse baseline postural control responded better to tDCS.",-1
"Recent progress of circular RNAs in different types of human cancer: Technological landscape, clinical opportunities and challenges (Review)","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of endogenous nonâcoding RNAs that have been recently regarded as functionally active. CircRNAs are remarkably stable and known to possess several biological functions such as microRNA sponging, regulating transcription and splicing and occasionally acting as polypeptideâproducing templates. CircRNAs show tissueâspecific expression and have been reported to be associated with the progression of several types of malignancies. Given the recent progress in genome sequencing and bioinformatics techniques, a rapid increment in the biological role of circRNAs has been observed. Concurrently, the patent search from different patent databases shows that the patent number of circRNA is increasing very quickly. These phenomena reveal a rapid development of the technological landscape. In the present review, the recent progress on circRNAs in various kinds of cancer has been investigated and their function as biomarkers or therapeutic targets and their technological landscape have been appreciated. A new insight into circRNAs structure and functional capabilities in cancer has been reviewed. Continually increasing knowledge on their critical role during cancer progression is projecting them as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for various kinds of cancer. Thus, recent updates on the functional role of circRNAs in terms of the technological landscape, clinical opportunities (biomarkers and therapeutic targets), and challenges in cancer have been illustrated.",-1
New therapy strategies in the management of breast cancer,"Breast cancer (BC), the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths after lung cancer, is the most common cancer type among women worldwide. BC comprises multiple subtypes based on molecular properties. Depending on the type of BC, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are the current systemic treatment options along with conventional chemotherapy. Several new molecular targets, miRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been discovered over the past few decades and are powerful potential therapeutic targets. Here, we review advanced therapeutics as new players in BC management.",-1
The Differential Expression of Circular RNAs in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults,"Objective: Expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the peripheral blood of individuals with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were quantified to identify dysregulated circRNAs compared with control individuals. Methods: circRNAs were obtained from the peripheral blood serum of 12 healthy adults and 12 individuals with LADA and 12 type 2 diabetics. The circRNA expression profiles were analyzed by high-throughput RNA sequencing. The most highly dysregulated circular RNAs were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A circular RNA-microRNA (miRNA) network diagram predicted the interactions of circular RNAs, miRNAs, and coding genes. Results: A total of 2334 differentially expressed circRNAs were detected among the three groups, with 277 circRNAs in the Group DM versus Group NG; 992 circRNAs in the Group LADA versus Group NG and 1065 circRNAs in the Group DM versus Group LADA. Six circRNAs were identified as the most distinctive differentially expressed targets (p < 0.05). The proposed molecular functions of these differentially expressed circRNAS included the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, the FoxO signaling pathway, cellular senescence, and long-term potentiation (all false discovery rate p < 0.05) which may contribute to T2DM and LADA. Conclusion: circRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the peripheral blood of patients with T2DM and LADA and may interact with miRNA and circRNA-derived peptides in the development of diabetes.

3D Reconstruction of cellular images from microfabricated imagers using fully-adaptive deep neural networks,"Millimeter-scale multi-cellular level imagers enable various applications, ranging from intraoperative surgical navigation to implantable sensors. However, the tradeoffs for miniaturization compromise resolution, making extracting 3D cell locations challenging-critical for tumor margin assessment and therapy monitoring. This work presents three machine-learning-based modules that extract spatial information from single image acquisitions using custom-made millimeter-scale imagers. The neural networks were trained on synthetically-generated (using Perlin noise) cell images. The first network is a convolutional neural network estimating the depth of a single layer of cells, the second is a deblurring module correcting for the point spread function (PSF). The final module extracts spatial information from a single image acquisition of a 3D specimen and reconstructs cross-sections, by providing a layered ""map"" of cell locations. The maximum depth error of the first module is 100 Âµm, with 87% test accuracy. The second module's PSF correction achieves a least-square-error of only 4%. The third module generates a binary ""cell"" or ""no cell"" per-pixel labeling with an accuracy ranging from 89% to 85%. This work demonstrates the synergy between ultra-small silicon-based imagers that enable in vivo imaging but face a trade-off in spatial resolution, and the processing power of neural networks to achieve enhancements beyond conventional linear optimization techniques.",-1
The Role of MicroRNAs in Proteostasis Decline and Protein Aggregation during Brain and Skeletal Muscle Aging,"Aging can be defined as the progressive deterioration of cellular, tissue, and organismal function over time. Alterations in protein homeostasis, also known as proteostasis, are a hallmark of aging that lead to proteome imbalances and protein aggregation, phenomena that also occur in age-related diseases. Among the various proteostasis regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play important roles in the post-transcriptional control of genes involved in maintaining proteostasis during the lifespan in several organismal tissues. In this review, we consolidate recently published reports that demonstrate how miRNAs regulate fundamental proteostasis-related processes relevant to tissue aging, with emphasis on the two most studied tissues, brain tissue and skeletal muscle. We also explore an emerging perspective on the role of miRNA regulatory networks in age-related protein aggregation, a known hallmark of aging and age-related diseases, to elucidate potential miRNA candidates for anti-aging diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",-1
Clinacanthus nutans Leaves Extract Reverts Endothelial Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes Rats by Improving Protein Expression of eNOS,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with endothelial dysfunction; it causes progressive vascular damage resulting from an impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. In the diabetes state, presence of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance predisposes to endothelial dysfunction. Clinacanthus nutans, widely used as a traditional medicine for diabetes is reported to have hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the possibility of C. nutans affecting the vascular endothelial function in diabetes remains unclear. This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of C. nutans methanolic leaves extract (CNME) on endothelial function in a type 2 diabetes (T2DM) rat model. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups (n = 12 per group): nondiabetic control, nondiabetic treated with four weeks of CNME (500 mg/kg/daily), untreated diabetic rats, diabetic treated with metformin (300 mg/kg/daily), and diabetic treated with CNME (500 mg/kg/daily). T2DM was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) to rats fed with high-fat diet (HFD). Endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent relaxations and contractions of the thoracic aorta were determined using the organ bath. Aortic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was determined using Western blotting. Endothelial-dependent relaxation was reduced in diabetic rats. Both diabetic groups treated with CNME or metformin significantly improved the impairment in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation; this was associated with increased expression of aortic eNOS protein. CNME- and metformin-treated groups also reduced aortic endothelium-dependent and aortic endothelium-independent contractions in diabetics. Both of these diabetic-treated groups also reduced blood glucose levels and increased body weight compared to the untreated diabetic group. In conclusion, C. nutans improves endothelial-dependent vasodilatation and reduces endothelial-dependent contraction, thus ameliorating endothelial dysfunction in diabetic rats. This may occur due to its effect on increasing eNOS protein expression.",-1
The dinucleotide composition of the Zika virus genome is shaped by conflicting evolutionary pressures in mammalian hosts and mosquito vectors,"Most vertebrate RNA viruses show pervasive suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, closely resembling the dinucleotide composition of host cell transcriptomes. In contrast, CpG suppression is absent in both invertebrate mRNA and RNA viruses that exclusively infect arthropods. Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by invertebrate vectors and thus encounter potentially conflicting evolutionary pressures in the different cytoplasmic environments. Using a newly developed Zika virus (ZIKV) model, we have investigated how demands for CpG suppression in vertebrate cells can be reconciled with potentially quite different compositional requirements in invertebrates and how this affects ZIKV replication and transmission. Mutant viruses with synonymously elevated CpG or UpA dinucleotide frequencies showed attenuated replication in vertebrate cell lines, which was rescued by knockout of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP). Conversely, in mosquito cells, ZIKV mutants with elevated CpG dinucleotide frequencies showed substantially enhanced replication compared to wild type. Host-driven effects on virus replication attenuation and enhancement were even more apparent in mouse and mosquito models. Infections with CpG- or UpA-high ZIKV mutants in mice did not cause typical ZIKV-induced tissue damage and completely protected mice during subsequent challenge with wild-type virus, which demonstrates their potential as live-attenuated vaccines. In contrast, the CpG-high mutants displayed enhanced replication in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and a larger proportion of mosquitoes carried infectious virus in their saliva. These findings show that mosquito cells are also capable of discriminating RNA based on dinucleotide composition. However, the evolutionary pressure on the CpG dinucleotides of viral genomes in arthropod vectors directly opposes the pressure present in vertebrate host cells, which provides evidence that an adaptive compromise is required for arbovirus transmission. This suggests that the genome composition of arbo flaviviruses is crucial to maintain the balance between high-level replication in the vertebrate host and persistent replication in the mosquito vector.",-1
No Participant Left Behind: Conducting Science During COVID-19,"Cognitive scientists have ramped up online testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although research conducted online solves the problem of data collection, the paucity of internet access among low-income and minority communities may reduce the diversity of study samples, and thus have an impact on the generalizability of scientific findings.",-1
Mosquito sound communication: are male swarms loud enough to attract females?,"Given the unsurpassed sound sensitivity of mosquitoes among arthropods and the sound source power required for long-range hearing, we investigated the distance over which female mosquitoes detect species-specific cues in the sound of station-keeping mating swarms. A common misunderstanding, that mosquitoes cannot hear at long range because their hearing organs are 'particle-velocity' receptors, has clouded the fact that particle velocity is an intrinsic component of sound whatever the distance to the sound source. We exposed free-flying Anopheles coluzzii females to pre-recorded sounds of male An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. swarms over a range of natural sound levels. Sound levels tested were related to equivalent distances between the female and the swarm for a given number of males, enabling us to infer distances over which females might hear large male swarms. We show that females do not respond to swarm sound up to 48 dB sound pressure level (SPL) and that louder SPLs are not ecologically relevant for a swarm. Considering that swarms are the only mosquito sound source that would be loud enough to be heard at long range, we conclude that inter-mosquito acoustic communication is restricted to close-range pair interactions. We also showed that the sensitivity to sound in free-flying males is much enhanced compared to that of tethered ones.",-1
Higher blood glucose impairs cardiac autonomic modulation in fasting and after carbohydrate overload in adults,"This study aimed to assess whether the blood glucose levels influence cardiac autonomic modulation under fasting and after carbohydrate overload conditions. Participants (n = 108) were separated into lower blood glucose and higher blood glucose groups, based on the median (90.5 mgÂ·dL-1) of fasting glucose assessed. The SD2, SDNN, LF indices, and LF/HF increased, and HF decreased after dextrose overload compared with fasting (p < 0.05). Body mass (78.9 vs 69.7 kg), abdominal circumference (90.2 vs 82.2 cm), systolic (113 vs 108 mm Hg) and diastolic (72 vs 67 mm Hg) blood pressure were higher (p < 0.05) in the higher blood glucose group. Heart rate variability (HRV) indices (SD1: 21.0 vs 26.5; SD2: 76.8: vs 86.1; RMSSD: 28.7 vs 37.5; SDNN: 56.1 vs 62.5 ms; pNN50: 10.6 vs 18.9%, HF: 328.4 vs 506.0; LF: 982.8 vs 1259.0 ms2), and the area under the curve of these indices after dextrose overload were lower in the higher blood glucose group (p < 0.05). Additionally, glycemia after dextrose overload was correlated with HRV indices (Ï = -0.216 to -0.273, p < 0.05). Individuals with higher blood glucose, even in the normality range, showed impairment in the cardiac autonomic modulation both at fasting and after carbohydrate overload. Novelty: Higher fasting blood glucose impairs cardiac autonomic modulation. Carbohydrate overload impairs cardiac autonomic modulation.",-1
Impact of the Rapid Normalization of Chronic Hyperglycemia on the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B Ligand and the Osteoprotegerin System in Patients Living with Type 2 Diabetes: RANKL-GLYC Study,"The RANKL-GLYC study aims to explore the impact of the rapid correction of chronic hyperglycemia on the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) and its antagonist osteoprotegerin (OPG). RANKL and OPG are considered the main factors in the pathophysiology of Charcot neuroarthropathy, a devastating complication of the joints that remains poorly understood. The study began recruiting patients in September 2021 and ends in June 2022; the final study results are scheduled for January 2023.",-1
Patterns of balance loss with systematic perturbations in Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis,"Background:                    Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may affect balance differently. However, no studies have compared loss of balance (LOB) patterns following multi-directional perturbations.              Objective:                    1) determine reliability of LOB ratings following standardized manual perturbations; 2) compare LOB ratings in MS, PD, and healthy control (HC) groups following perturbations at upper/lower torso, in anterior/posterior, right/left, and rotational directions.              Methods:                    1) reviewers rated videotaped LOB following perturbations applied by 4 clinicians in 6-10 HCs. 2) three groups (64 MS, 42 PD and 32 HC) received perturbations. LOB ratings following perturbations were analyzed using two-factor mixed ANOVAs for magnitude and prevalence.              Results:                    1) LOB ratings showed moderate to good ICC and good to excellent agreement. 2) MS group showed greater magnitude and prevalence of LOB than PD or HC groups (p < .001). All groups showed greater LOB from right/left versus anterior/posterior perturbations (p < .01). PD showed greater LOB from perturbations at upper versus lower torso; MS and HC showed greater LOB from posterior versus anterior perturbations.              Conclusions:                    Our reliable rating scale showed differences in patterns of LOB following manual perturbations in MS, PD, and HC. Clinically accessible and reliable assessment of LOB could facilitate targeted perturbation-based interventions and reduce falls in vulnerable populations.",-1
Fecal microbiota transplantation protects rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease mice via suppressing inflammation mediated by the lipopolysaccharide-TLR4 signaling pathway through the microbiota-gut-brain axis,"Background:                    Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, displaying not only well-known motor deficits but also gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Consistently, it has been increasingly evident that gut microbiota affects the communication between the gut and the brain in PD pathogenesis, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As an approach to re-establishing a normal microbiota community, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has exerted beneficial effects on PD in recent studies. Here, in this study, we established a chronic rotenone-induced PD mouse model to evaluate the protective effects of FMT treatment on PD and to explore the underlying mechanisms, which also proves the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.              Results:                    We demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by rotenone administration caused gastrointestinal function impairment and poor behavioral performances in the PD mice. Moreover, 16S RNA sequencing identified the increase of bacterial genera Akkermansia and Desulfovibrio in fecal samples of rotenone-induced mice. By contrast, FMT treatment remarkably restored the gut microbial community, thus ameliorating the gastrointestinal dysfunctions and the motor deficits of the PD mice. Further experiments revealed that FMT administration alleviated intestinal inflammation and barrier destruction, thus reducing the levels of systemic inflammation. Subsequently, FMT treatment attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and suppressed neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra (SN), which further decreased the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Additional mechanistic investigation discovered that FMT treatment reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the colon, the serum, and the SN, thereafter suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products both in the SN and the colon.              Conclusions:                    Our current study demonstrates that FMT treatment can correct the gut microbiota dysbiosis and ameliorate the rotenone-induced PD mouse model, in which suppression of the inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway both in the gut and the brain possibly plays a significant role. Further, we prove that rotenone-induced microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the genesis of PD via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Video abstract.",-1
Association between Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Diseases and the Blood Concentration of Carotenoids among the General Population without Apparent Illness,"Several studies have demonstrated that carotenoid-rich vegetables are useful against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, it is still unclear when a healthy population should start eating these vegetables to prevent CVDs. In this study, we evaluated the role of carotenoids in CVD markers in healthy subjects using age-stratified analysis. We selected 1350 subjects with no history of apparent illness who were undergoing health examinations. We then evaluated the relationship between the serum concentrations of six major carotenoids as well as their total, and nine CVD markers (i.e., body mass index (BMI), pulse wave velocity (PWV), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), blood insulin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TGs), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol) using multiple regression analysis. It was found that the total carotenoid level was significantly associated with seven markers other than BMI and FBG in males and with eight markers other than DBP in females. Many of these relationships were independent of lifestyle habits. Many significant relationships were found in young males (aged 20-39) and middle-aged females (aged 40-59). These findings can be used as lifestyle guidance for disease prevention although the causal relationships should be confirmed.",-1
[Automatic detection model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on deep convolutional neural network],"The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is of great significance for the early risk classification of sudden cardiac death and the screening of family genetic diseases. This research proposed a HCM automatic detection method based on convolution neural network (CNN) model, using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal as the research object. Firstly, the R-wave peak locations of single-lead ECG signal were determined, followed by the ECG signal segmentation and resample in units of heart beats, then a CNN model was built to automatically extract the deep features in the ECG signal and perform automatic classification and HCM detection. The experimental data is derived from 108 ECG records extracted from three public databases provided by PhysioNet, the database established in this research consists of 14,459 heartbeats, and each heartbeat contains 128 sampling points. The results revealed that the optimized CNN model could effectively detect HCM, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 95.98%, 98.03% and 95.79% respectively. In this research, the deep learning method was introduced for the analysis of single-lead ECG of HCM patients, which could not only overcome the technical limitations of conventional detection methods based on multi-lead ECG, but also has important application value for assisting doctor in fast and convenient large-scale HCM preliminary screening.",-1
Seasonality of Aedes albopictus in North and Central Mississippi,"Container-breeding mosquitoes are increasingly important in public health due to recent outbreaks of Zika virus, chikungunya, and dengue. This paper documents seasonality of the most prevalent container-breeding mosquito species in Mississippi-Aedes albopictus. Ten sites in 5 counties in both northern and central Mississippi (20 sites, 10 counties total) were sampled by larval dipping and oviposition traps biweekly from September 2016 to June 2019, totaling 22 months and potentially yielding 440 egg or larval collections. However, 22 collections were missed due to inclement weather and personnel issues during the study period, so actually only 418 site visits were performed. Sites were chosen to maximize chances of finding Ae. albopictus. Of the total 1,310 mosquito larvae collected during the study period, 717 larvae and 50 positive egg papers belonged to Ae. albopictus. Aedes albopictus was found in all 10 northern and central counties. No eggs were collected at any of the sites from December through February, although larvae were occasionally collected during that time frame. This study demonstrates that Ae. albopictus is active in central and northern Mississippi beginning in March each year and continuing through November or December. There is little activity during the coldest months of the year (January and February). These data represent the first extensive analysis of Ae. albopictus seasonality in Mississippi, and as such, allow for better public health awareness of diseases transmitted by this species and design of more effective vector control programs.",-1
Increasing Effectiveness of Genetically Modifying Mosquito Populations: Risk Assessment of Releasing Blood-Fed Females,"Releasing mosquito refractory to pathogens has been proposed as a means of controlling mosquito-borne diseases. A recent modeling study demonstrated that instead of the conventional male-only releases, adding blood-fed females to the release population could significantly increase the program's efficiency, hastening the decrease in disease transmission competence of the target mosquito population and reducing the duration and costs of the release program. However, releasing female mosquitoes presents a short-term risk of increased disease transmission. To quantify this risk, we constructed a Ross-MacDonald model and an individual-based stochastic model to estimate the increase in disease transmission contributed by the released blood-fed females, using the mosquito Aedes aegypti and the dengue virus as a model system. Under baseline parameter values informed by empirical data, our stochastic models predicted a 1.1-5.5% increase in dengue transmission during the initial release, depending on the resistance level of released mosquitoes and release size. The basic reproductive number (R0) increased by 0.45-3.62%. The stochastic simulations were then extended to 10 releases to evaluate the long-term effect. The overall reduction of disease transmission was much greater than the number of potential infections directly contributed by the released females. Releasing blood-fed females with males could also outperform conventional male-only releases when the release strain is sufficiently resistant, and the release size is relatively small. Overall, these results suggested that the long-term benefit of releasing blood-fed females often outweighs the short-term risk.",-1
PXR phosphorylated at Ser350 transduces a glucose signal to repress the estrogen sulfotransferase gene in human liver cells and fasting signal in mouse livers,"Hepatic estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1), the enzyme that inactivates estrogen, regulates metabolic estrogen homeostasis. Here, we have demonstrated how nuclear receptor PXR regulated the SULT1E1 gene in response to glucose in human hepatoma-derived cells and in response to fasting in mouse livers. The SULT1E1 gene was activated by a nuclear receptor HNF4Î±-RORÎ± complex binding on an upstream enhancer of the SULT1E1 promoter in cells cultured in high glucose medium (Hu and Negishi, 2020). The SULT1E1 gene was repressed in cells cultured in low glucose medium, in which PXR was phosphorylated at Ser350 by vaccinia virus-related kinase 1. Phosphorylated PXR interacted with this complex, retaining HNF4Î± on and dissociating RORÎ± from the enhancer as a phosphorylated PXR complex. Therefore, in response to low glucose, phosphorylated PXR transduced a low glucose signal to repress the SULT1E1 gene in cells. Hepatic Sult1e1 mRNA was induced in PXR wild type (WT) male mice in response to fasting, whereas this induction was synergistically increased in phosphorylation-blocking PXR Ser347Ala (Ser350 in human) KI males over that observed in PXR WT males. As phosphorylated PXR repressed the Sult1e1 gene, it increased its binding to the Sult1e1 promoter in WT males. The absence of phosphorylated PXR resulted in the synergistic activation of the Sult1e1 gene in PXR KI males. Apparently, phosphorylated PXR functioned as a transcriptional repressor to the SULT1E1/Sult1e1 gene in human liver cells and mouse livers.",-1
Association of muscle and visceral adipose tissues with the probability of Alzheimer's disease in healthy subjects,"Increasing evidence indicates that sarcopenia and obesity can be risk factors for incident dementia. We investigated the association of body composition including muscle and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) with the probability of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in healthy middle-aged and elderly subjects using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). This study included 110 healthy subjects with available whole-body FDG PET/CT scans and medical records. Muscle and VAT tissues were measured on the abdominal CT slice, and the PMOD Alzheimer's discrimination FDG PET analysis tool (PALZ) score was evaluated on the brain PET of the same subject using software PALZ. Skeletal muscle index (r: -0.306; P = 0.031) was significantly negatively associated with the PALZ score in the elderly patients. Muscle area (Î²: -0.640; P = 0.043) and skeletal muscle index (Î²: -0.557; P = 0.043) were independently associated with the PALZ score in elderly subjects after adjustments for sex, duration of education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking and drinking status. Increased muscle tissue was associated with a lower probability of AD in elderly subjects, but VAT was not associated with a lower probability of AD in middle-or older-aged adults.",-1
Which source and level of dietary sodium is appropriate for broiler chickens reared in a high-altitude area?,"This study investigated effect of increasing level of dietary sodium using sodium bicarbonate or sodium chloride on growth performance, mortality, characteristics of carcass, organs and tibia, calcium and phosphorus of serum in broilers reared in a high-altitude area (1,700 m above sea level). A total of 588 Ross 308 male broiler chicks were used in seven treatments, six replicates per treatment of 14 birds per each from 1 to 38 d of age. Seven dietary treatments consisted of a basal diet (with 0.16% sodium and 0.23% chloride), top-dressed for six diets to give three supplementary levels of sodium (0.07%, 0.14% and 0.21%) from sodium bicarbonate (respectively by 0.26%, 0.52% and 0.78%) or sodium chloride (respectively by 0.18%, 0.36% and 0.54%), resulting in seven diets with total sodium and chloride levels of 0.16% and 0.23%, 0.23% and 0.23%, 0.30% and 0.23%, 0.37% and 0.23%, 0.23% and 0.33%, 0.30% and 0.44%, 0.37% and 0.55% respectively. Increasing sodium level improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) linearly and quadratically. However, when FCR was calculated without adjusting for feed intake of mortalities, the enhanced sodium level did not improve this parameter. Increasing sodium level via sodium chloride enhanced ascites mortality, total mortality, relative weight of heart and right ventricle linearly. Increasing sodium level reduced serum calcium and enhanced serum phosphorus linearly; however, there was a linear tendency to increase tibia ash when sodium level was enhanced by sodium bicarbonate (p = 0.08) or sodium chloride (p = 0.07). Increasing sodium level via sodium bicarbonate tended (p = 0.08) to reduce tibia strength linearly. In conclusion, a diet with 0.16% sodium and 0.23% chloride is enough for broiler chicken reared in a high-altitude area, and increasing dietary sodium level via sodium chloride has detrimental effect on survivability of broiler in such condition.",-1
Long Non-Coding RNAs Might Regulate Phenotypic Switch of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Acting as ceRNA: Implications for In-Stent Restenosis,"Coronary in-stent restenosis is a late complication of angioplasty. It is a multifactorial process that involves vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), endothelial cells, and inflammatory and genetic factors. In this study, the transcriptomic landscape of VSMCs' phenotypic switch process was assessed under stimuli resembling stent injury. Co-cultured contractile VSMCs and endothelial cells were exposed to a bare metal stent and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) 20 ng/mL. Migratory capacity (wound healing assay), proliferative capacity, and cell cycle analysis of the VSMCs were performed. RNAseq analysis of contractile vs. proliferative VSMCs was performed. Gene differential expression (DE), identification of new long non-coding RNA candidates (lncRNAs), gene ontology (GO), and pathway enrichment (KEGG) were analyzed. A competing endogenous RNA network was constructed, and significant lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes were selected. VSMCs exposed to ""stent injury"" conditions showed morphologic changes, with proliferative and migratory capacities progressing from G0-G1 cell cycle phase to S and G2-M. RNAseq analysis showed DE of 1099, 509 and 64 differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs, respectively. GO analysis of DE genes showed significant enrichment in collagen and extracellular matrix organization, regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, and collagen biosynthetic process. The main upregulated nodes in the lncRNA-mediated ceRNA network were PVT1 and HIF1-AS2, with downregulation of ACTA2-AS1 and MIR663AHG. The PVT1 ceRNA axis appears to be an attractive target for in-stent restenosis diagnosis and treatment.",-1
Hierarchical deep learning model to simulate phytoplankton at phylum/class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a global issue, affecting public health and water industries in numerous countries. Because funds for monitoring HABs are limited, model development may be an alternative approach for understanding and managing HABs. Continuous monitoring based on grab sampling is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. However, improving simulation performance remains a major challenge in modeling, and current methods are limited to simulating phytoplankton (e.g., Microcystis sp., Anabaena sp., Aulacoseira sp., Cyclotella sp., Pediastrum sp., and Eudorina sp.) and zooplankton (e.g., Cyclotella sp., Pediastrum sp., and Eudorina sp.) at the genus level. The traditional modeling approach is limited for evaluating the interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Recently, deep learning (DL) models have been proposed for solving modeling problems because of their large data handling capabilities and model structure flexibilities. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of DL for simulating phytoplankton at the phylum/class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level. Our work was an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the DL model structure. The prerequisite for this model design was the data collection at two taxonomic and hierarchical levels. Our model consisted of hierarchical DL with classification transformer (TF) and regression TF models. These DL models were hierarchically connected; the output of the phylum/class level model was transferred to the genus level simulation model, and the output of the genus level model was fed into the zooplankton simulation model. The classification TF model determined the phytoplankton occurrence initiation date, whereas the regression TF model quantified the cell concentration of plankton. The hierarchical DL showed potential to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum/class and genus levels by producing average R2, and root mean standard error values of 0.42 and 0.83 [log(cells mL-1)], respectively. All simulated plankton results closely matched the measured concentrations. Particularly, the simulated cyanobacteria showed good agreement with the measured cell concentration, with an R2 value of 0.72. In addition, our simulated result showed good agreement in peak concentration compared to observations. However, a limitation remained in following the temporal variation of Tintinnopsis sp. and Bosmia sp. Using an importance map from the TF model, water temperature, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen were identified as significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms. Overall, our study demonstrated that DL can be used for modeling HABs at the phylum/class and genus levels.",-1
Semi-field assessment of the Gravid Aedes Trap (GAT) with the aim of controlling Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti populations,"The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main vector of arboviroses and current approaches to control this vector are not sufficiently effective. Adult traps, such as the BG-Sentinel (BGS), have been successfully used for mosquito surveillance and can also suppress vector populations. A new ""passive"" trap for gravid Ae. aegypti (Gravid Aedes Trap-GAT) has been shown efficient for Aedes collection and suppress Ae. albopictus populations using mass trapping techniques. Here the GAT was evaluated for the first time as a new tool to control Ae. aegypti in semi-field conditions using simulated outdoor environments (SOE). Two identical large screened chambers inside of a SOE containing different numbers and sizes of artificial breeding sites were used to assess the trapping efficiency of the GAT. One hundred mosquitoes were released into the chambers, and recapture rates evaluated after 48h. The parity status of the captured mosquitoes was also recorded. The number of eggs laid, and breeding productivity were also monitored when using different numbers and sizes of breeding sites. The BGS trap was used here as a control (gold standard) trap to compare capture rates to those of the GAT. The GAT recaptured between 50-65% of the mosquitoes independent of the number and sizes of the breeding sites in the SOEs, whereas the BGS recaptured 60-82% of the females. Both traps showed similar results regarding to the parity status of recaptured mosquitoes. Our results confirmed the effectiveness of GAT for the capture of adult female Ae. aegypti in simulated field environments. The BGS trap recaptured gravid Ae. aegypti before egg-laying in different sizes and number of breading sites, whereas the oviposition activity occurred prior to recapture mosquitoes in the GAT. Based on the results, we believe that GAT is a promising candidate for mass-trapping intervention in urban settings, but a source reduction intervention should be made prior trap deployment. Therefore, we suggest future field studies to confirm the use of GAT as a complementary tool in vector control activities.",-1
Automating and improving cardiovascular disease prediction using Machine learning and EMR data features from a regional healthcare system,"Background:                    The ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) Risk Calculator is widely used in the US for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but may under- or over-estimate risk in some populations. We therefore designed an automated, population-specific ASCVD risk calculator using machine-learning (ML) methods and electronic medical record (EMR) data, and compared its predictive power with that of the PCE calculator.              Methods and findings:                    We collected data from 101,110 unique EMRs of living patients from January 1, 2009 to April 30, 2020. ML techniques were applied to patient datasets that included either only cross-sectional (CS) features, or CS combined with longitudinal (LT) features derived from vital statistics and laboratory values. We compared the utility of the models using a proposed new cost measure (Screened Cases Percentage @ Sensitivity level). All ML models tested achieved better predictive power than the PCE risk calculator. The random forest ML technique (RF) applied on the combination of CS and LT features (RF-LTC) produced the best area under curve (AUC) score of 0.902 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.895-0.910). To detect 90% of all positive ASCVD cases, the best ML model required screening only 43% of patients, while the PCE risk calculator required screening 69% of patients.              Conclusions:                    Prediction models built using ML techniques improved ASCVD prediction and reduced the number of screenings required to predict ASCVD when compared with the PCE calculator, alone. Combining LT and CS features in the ML models significantly improved ASCVD prediction compared with using CS features, alone.",-1
Evaluation of Mosquito Magnet and other collection tools for Anopheles mosquito vectors of simian malaria,"Background:                    Vector surveillance is essential in determining the geographical distribution of mosquito vectors and understanding the dynamics of malaria transmission. With the elimination of human malaria cases, knowlesi malaria cases in humans are increasing in Malaysia. This necessitates intensive vector studies using safer trapping methods which are both field efficient and able to attract the local vector populations. Thus, this study evaluated the potential of Mosquito Magnet as a collection tool for Anopheles mosquito vectors of simian malaria along with other known collection methods.              Methods:                    A randomized 4 Ã 4 Latin square designed experiment was conducted to compare the efficiency of the Mosquito Magnet against three other common trapping methods: human landing catch (HLC), CDC light trap and human baited trap (HBT). The experiment was conducted over six replicates where sampling within each replicate was carried out for 4 consecutive nights. An additional 4 nights of sampling was used to further evaluate the Mosquito Magnet against the ""gold standard"" HLC. The abundance of Anopheles sampled by different methods was compared and evaluated with focus on the Anopheles from the Leucosphyrus group, the vectors of knowlesi malaria.              Results:                    The Latin square designed experiment showed HLC caught the greatest number of Anopheles mosquitoes (n = 321) compared to the HBT (n = 87), Mosquito Magnet (n = 58) and CDC light trap (n = 13). The GLMM analysis showed that the HLC method caught significantly more Anopheles mosquitoes compared to Mosquito Magnet (P = 0.049). However, there was no significant difference in mean nightly catch of Anopheles mosquitoes between Mosquito Magnet and the other two trapping methods, HBT (P = 0.646) and CDC light traps (P = 0.197). The mean nightly catch for both An. introlatus (9.33 Â± 4.341) and An. cracens (4.00 Â± 2.273) caught using HLC was higher than that of Mosquito Magnet, though the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). This is in contrast to the mean nightly catch of An. sinensis (15.75 Â± 5.640) and An. maculatus (15.78 Â± 3.479) where HLC showed significantly more mosquito catches compared to Mosquito Magnet (P < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Mosquito Magnet has a promising ability to catch An. introlatus and An. cracens, the important vectors of knowlesi and other simian malarias in Peninsular Malaysia. The ability of Mosquito Magnet to catch some of the Anopheles mosquito species is comparable to HLC and makes it an ethical and safer alternative.",-1
Comparison of two advanced hybrid closed loop in a pediatric population with type 1 diabetes: a real-life observational study,"Objective:                    The Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) systems have provided the potential to ameliorate glucose control in children with Type 1 Diabetes. The aim of the present work was to compare metabolic control obtained with 2 AHCL systems (Medtronic 780G system and Tandem Control IQ system) in a pediatric real-life clinical context.              Research design and methods:                    It is an observational, real-life, monocentric study; thirty one children and adolescents (M:F = 15:16, age range 7.6-18 years, mean age 13.05 Â± 2.4 years, Diabetes duration > 1 year) with T1D, previously treated with Predictive Low Glucose Suspend (PLGS) systems and then upgraded to AHCL have been enrolled. CGM data of the last four weeks of ""PLGS system"" (PRE period) with the first four weeks of AHCL system (POST period) have been compared.              Results:                    For both AHCL systems, Medtronic 780G and Tandem Control IQ, respectively TIR at 4 weeks significantly increased, from 65.7 to 70.5% (p < 0.01) and from 64.8 to 70.1% (p < 0.01). (p < 0.01). The comparison between CGM metrics of the 2 evaluated systems doesn't show difference at baseline (last four weeks of PLGS system) and after four weeks of AHCL use.              Conclusions:                    To our knowledge, this study is the first real-life one comparing 2 AHCL systems in a pediatric population with T1D. It shows an improvement in glucose control when upgrading to AHCL. The comparison between the two AHCL systems did not show significant differences in the analyzed CGM metrics, meaning that the algorithms currently available are equally effective in promoting glucose control.",-1
"Correlation between DXA and laboratory parameters in normal weight, overweight, and obese patients","Objective:                    The aim of this study was to review the existence and types of correlations between body composition densitometric parameters and laboratory values associated to cardiometabolic risk.              Methods:                    We retrospectively analyzed data from 316 individuals in the weight range from normality to super-obesity, submitted to total body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and routine biochemistry at S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital from June 2010 to March 2014. The study included 182 women, 45.8 Â± 13.4 y of age, with a body mass index (BMI) of 31.5 (Â± 11) kg/m2 (group F) and 134 men, 45.4 Â± 13.6 y of age, with a BMI of 27.6 (Â± 7.8) kg/m2 (group M). All patients underwent whole-body scan (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA) and laboratory analysis (blood fasting glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tricylglycerides [TGs], aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase). Correlation between laboratory values and total body and regional fat mass (including visceral adipose tissue [VAT] and subcutaneous adipose tissue in the android region), and lean mass parameters were analyzed with linear and stepwise regressions analysis (significance limit, P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curves were performed to assess the accuracy of the best-fit DXA parameter (VAT) to identify at least one laboratory risk factor.              Results:                    In both groups, BMI and densitometric parameters showed a linear correlation with fasting blood glucose and TG levels and an inverse correlation with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.05), whereas no correlation was observed with total cholesterol levels. The only densitometric parameter retained in the final model of stepwise multiple regression was VAT for fasting blood glucose (group F: Î² = 0.4627, P < 0.0001; group M: Î² = 0.6221, P < 0.0001) and TG levels (group F: Î² = 0.4931, P < 0.0001; group M: Î² = 0.1990, P < 0.0261) independently of BMI. The optimal cutoff points of VAT to identify the presence of at least one laboratory risk factor were >1395 g and >1479 cm3 for men and >1281 g and >1357 cm3 for women.              Conclusions:                    DXA analysis of VAT is associated with selected laboratory parameters used for the evaluation of cardiometabolic risk and could be per se a helpful parameter in the assessment of clinical risk.",-1
Sorting and packaging of RNA into extracellular vesicles shape intracellular transcript levels,"Background:                    Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by nearly every cell type and have attracted much attention for their ability to transfer protein and diverse RNA species from donor to recipient cells. Much attention has been given so far to the features of EV short RNAs such as miRNAs. However, while the presence of mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts in EVs has also been reported by multiple different groups, the properties and function of these longer transcripts have been less thoroughly explored than EV miRNA. Additionally, the impact of EV export on the transcriptome of exporting cells has remained almost completely unexamined. Here, we globally investigate mRNA and lncRNA transcripts in endothelial EVs in multiple different conditions.              Results:                    In basal conditions, long RNA transcripts enriched in EVs have longer than average half-lives and distinctive stability-related sequence and structure characteristics including shorter transcript length, higher exon density, and fewer 3' UTR A/U-rich elements. EV-enriched long RNA transcripts are also enriched in HNRNPA2B1 binding motifs and are impacted by HNRNPA2B1 depletion, implicating this RNA-binding protein in the sorting of long RNA to EVs. After signaling-dependent modification of the cellular transcriptome, we observed that, unexpectedly, the rate of EV enrichment relative to cells was altered for many mRNA and lncRNA transcripts. This change in EV enrichment was negatively correlated with intracellular abundance, with transcripts whose export to EVs increased showing decreased abundance in cells and vice versa. Correspondingly, after treatment with inhibitors of EV secretion, levels of mRNA and lncRNA transcripts that are normally highly exported to EVs increased in cells, indicating a measurable impact of EV export on the long RNA transcriptome of the exporting cells. Compounds with different mechanisms of inhibition of EV secretion affected the cellular transcriptome differently, suggesting the existence of multiple EV subtypes with different long RNA profiles.              Conclusions:                    We present evidence for an impact of EV physiology on the characteristics of EV-producing cell transcriptomes. Our work suggests a new paradigm in which the sorting and packaging of transcripts into EVs participate, together with transcription and RNA decay, in controlling RNA homeostasis and shape the cellular long RNA abundance profile.",-1
"Efficacy and Safety of Lactobacillus plantarum K50 on Lipids in Koreans With Obesity: A Randomized, Double-Blind Controlled Clinical Trial","Background:                    Only few studies have investigated the role of probiotics in the development of obesity. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of an intake of Lactobacillus plantarum K50 (LPK) on body fat and lipid profiles in people with obesity.              Methods:                    This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial involved 81 adults with a body mass index of 25-30 kg/m2 who were assigned randomly to a diet including 4 Ã 109 colony-forming unit of LPK or a placebo. Changes in body fat, anthropometric parameters, and biomarkers of obesity were compared using a linear mixed-effect model.              Results:                    After 12 weeks of treatment, body weight, fat mass, and abdominal fat area did not change significantly in the two groups. However, total cholesterol levels decreased from 209.4 Â± 34.4 mg/dL to 203.5 Â± 30.9 mg/dL in the LPK group, but increased from 194.7 Â± 37.5 mg/dL to 199.9 Â± 30.7 mg/dL in the placebo group (P = 0.037). Similarly, triglyceride levels decreased from 135.4 Â± 115.8 mg/dL to 114.5 Â± 65.9 mg/dL in the LPK group, with a significant difference between groups. LPK supplementation also tended to decrease leptin levels compared with placebo. It also changed the distribution of gut microbiota significantly, with an increase in L. plantarum and a decrease in Actinobacteria, both of whose changes in abundance were correlated with changes in visceral adiposity, with borderline significance.              Conclusion:                    A 12-week consumption of LPK reduced the total cholesterol and triglyceride levels significantly with favorable alterations in microbiota, suggesting potential benefits for controlling blood lipid profiles.",-1
circ0125803 facilitates tumor progression by sponging miR-197-5p and upregulating E2F1 in neuroblastoma,"Background:                    Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are one type of RNAs with many different functions. circRNAs are very crucial in human malignancy progression. However, few studies have investigated the function and exact mechanism of circRNAs in neuroblastoma. In the current study, we investigated the biological function of circ0125803 in the proliferation and metastasis of neuroblastoma.              Methods:                    A high-throughput circRNA microarray sequencing was conducted to screen differentially expressed circRNAs and in neuroblastoma. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of circRNA and miRNA. RNA immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase reporter experiments were both conducted to investigate the molecular interaction mechanism of circ0125803 in neuroblastoma.              Results:                    We identified hsa_circ_0125803 (circ0125803) as an extremely upregulated circRNA in neuroblastoma samples. Knockdown of circ0125803 significantly decreased the growth rate and invasion rate in neuroblastoma. Our data demonstrated upregulation of circ0125803 promotes the neuroblastoma progression by blocking miR-197-5p and upregulating E2F1 expression.              Conclusion:                    This study uncovered the biological function of the circ0125803-miR-197-5p-E2F1 axis in neuroblastoma metastasis and growth.",-1
Bioinformatics Methods Reveal the Biomarkers and the miRNA-mRNA Network in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has threatened the health of humans, and few therapeutic strategies can completely uproot this illness. Bioinformatics methods have been widely used for investigating the pathological mechanisms of disease. In this study, datasets including GSE20077 and GSE108724, obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, were used for investigating the biomarker and molecular mechanism of HCC. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the datasets were identified, and the targets of the miRNAs were searched in the miRDIP and miRNET databases. Enrichment analysis was performed for delving the molecular mechanism of DEGs, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and miRNA-mRNA networks were used to reveal the hub nodes and the related interaction relationships. Moreover, the expression and diagnostic values of hub nodes were analyzed with the GEPIA2 database. The results showed that 53 upregulated miRNAs and 48 downregulated miRNAs were found in GSE20077, and 55 upregulated miRNAs and 69 downregulated miRNAs were found in GSE108724. Moreover, seven common miRNAs including miR-146b-5p, miR-338-3p, miR-375, miR-502-3p, miR-532-3p, miR-532-5p, and miR-557 were found in the datasets. The targets of the common miRNAs were related with the P53, HIF1, Wnt, and NF-ÎºB pathways. Besides, YWHAZ and CDC42 were identified as the hub nodes and served as the downstream targets of miR-375-3p. The GEPIA2 database showed that YWHAZ and CDC42 were related with the survival rate of the patients. In conclusion, this study suggests that miR-375-3p functions as a tumor suppressor which could inhibit the progression of HCC via targeting YWHAZ and CDC42.",-1
"Fasting Plasma Glucose Level Independently Predicts the Mortality of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: A Multicenter, Retrospective Cohort Study","Background:                    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, which prompts a consensus for the necessity to seek risk factors for this critical disease. Risk factors affecting mortality of the disease remain elusive. Diabetes and hyperglycemia are known to negatively affect a host's antiviral immunity. We evaluated the relationship between a history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and mortality among severely ill patients with COVID-19.              Methods:                    This was a retrospective cohort study that assessed 106 adult inpatients (aged â?8 years) from two tertiary hospitals in Daegu, South Korea. The participants were transferred to tertiary hospitals because their medical condition required immediate intensive care. The demographic and laboratory data were compared between COVID-19 patients who survived and those who did not.              Results:                    Compared with the survivor group, age, and the proportions of diabetes, chronic lung disease and FPG were significantly higher in the deceased group. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model for survival analysis, FPG level and age were identified as significant predictors of mortality (P&lt;0.05). The threshold values for predicting high mortality were age &gt;68 years and FPG of 168 mg/dL, respectively. Among those without diabetes, high FPG remained a significant predictor of mortality (P&lt;0.04).              Conclusion:                    High FPG levels significantly predicted mortality in COVID-19, regardless of a known history of diabetes. These results suggest intensive monitoring should be provided to COVID-19 patients who have a high FPG level.",-1
"Relationships between circulating 25(OH) vitamin D, leptin levels and visceral adipose tissue volume: results from a 1-year lifestyle intervention program in men with visceral obesity","Background/objectives:                    Obesity has been associated with elevated leptinemia and vitamin D deficiency. To date, whether there is an association between vitamin D and leptin levels independent from adiposity remains uncertain. Our objective was to investigate the associations between changes in 25(OH) vitamin D levels, changes in adiposity variables, and changes in leptin levels produced by a 1-year lifestyle intervention program.              Subjects/methods:                    Sedentary men (n = 113) with abdominal obesity, dyslipidemic, and non-vitamin D supplemented were involved in a 1-year lifestyle modification program. Subjects were individually counseled by a kinesiologist and a nutritionist once every 2 weeks during the first 4 months with subsequent monthly visits in order to elicit a 500 kcal daily energy deficit and to increase physical activity/exercise habits. Adiposity mapping by computed tomography and cardiometabolic biomarkers, as well as vitamin D measurements were performed at baseline and at the 1-year visit.              Results:                    The 1-year intervention resulted in a 26% decrease in visceral adipose tissue volume (from 1951 Â± 481 to 1463 Â± 566 cm3), a 27% decrease in leptin levels (from 12.0 Â± 8.1 to 8.5 Â± 7.8 ng/mL) and a 27% increase in plasma 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations (from 50 Â± 18 to 60 Â± 18 nmol/L, p < 0.0001). One-year increases in 25(OH) vitamin D levels were inversely correlated with 1-year changes in leptin levels (r = -0.41, p < 0.001). The association remained significant after adjustment for 1-year changes in various adiposity indices: visceral adipose tissue (r = -0.30, p = 0.0019), subcutaneous adipose tissue (r = -0.35, p = 0.0004), total abdominal adipose tissue (r = -0.31, p = 0.0015), and fat mass (r = -0.31, p = 0.001).              Conclusions:                    In response to a 1-year lifestyle intervention, changes in 25(OH) vitamin D levels were independently associated with changes in leptinemia after adjustment for adiposity changes. This finding supports a possible physiological link between leptinemia and 25(OH) vitamin D levels independent from adiposity and underscores the role of lifestyle modifications leading to lowered leptinemia in the clinical management of vitamin D deficiency.",-1
Regenerating Skeletal Muscle Compensates for the Impaired Macrophage Functions Leading to Normal Muscle Repair in Retinol Saturase Null Mice,"Skeletal muscle repair is initiated by local inflammation and involves the engulfment of dead cells (efferocytosis) by infiltrating macrophages at the injury site. Macrophages orchestrate the whole repair program, and efferocytosis is a key event not only for cell clearance but also for triggering the timed polarization of the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages into the healing one. While pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by the inflammatory macrophages induce satellite cell proliferation and differentiation into myoblasts, healing macrophages initiate the resolution of inflammation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix formation and drive myoblast fusion and myotube growth. Therefore, improper efferocytosis results in impaired muscle repair. Retinol saturase (RetSat) initiates the formation of various dihydroretinoids, a group of vitamin A derivatives that regulate transcription by activating retinoid receptors. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that RetSat-null macrophages produce less milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor-8 (MFG-E8), lack neuropeptide Y expression, and are characterized by impaired efferocytosis. Here, we investigated skeletal muscle repair in the tibialis anterior muscle of RetSat-null mice following cardiotoxin injury. Our data presented here demonstrate that, unexpectedly, several cell types participating in skeletal muscle regeneration compensate for the impaired macrophage functions, resulting in normal muscle repair in the RetSat-null mice.",-1
Pre-therapy fasting slows epithelial turnover and modulates the microbiota but fails to mitigate methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal mucositis,"Background:                    Recent findings by Tang et al. (2020) show dietary restriction (30%, 2 weeks) prevents methotrexate-induced mortality by modulation of the microbiota, specifically the expansion of Lactobacillus. While fundamentally insightful, upscaling this schedule is a major obstacle to clinical uptake. Here, we evaluate a safe and clinically achievable schedule of pre-therapy fasting for 48 h on microbiota composition, body composition and intestinal proliferation, and assess its impact on the severity of methotrexate-induced gastrointestinal mucositis using a validated preclinical rat model.              Methods:                    Age- and weight-matched male Wistar rats were treated with a sublethal dose of 45 mg/kg methotrexate with or without pre-therapy fasting. The impact of acute fasting on epithelial proliferation, body composition and the microbiota was assessed using plasma citrulline, Ki67 immunohistochemistry, miniSpec and 16S rRNA sequencing. The severity of gastrointestinal mucositis was evaluated using plasma citrulline and body weight.              Results:                    Whilst pre-therapy fasting slowed epithelial proliferation and increased microbial diversity and richness, it also induced significant weight loss and was unable to attenuate the severity of mucositis in both age- and weight-matched groups. In contrast to Tang et al., we saw no expansion of Lactobacillus following acute fasting.              Conclusions:                    Our findings suggest that the beneficial effects of acute fasting are masked by the detrimental effects on body weight and composition and lacking influence on Lactobacillus. Future studies should consider alternative fasting schedules or aim to induce comparable microbial and mucosal manipulation without compromising body composition using clinically feasible methods of dietary or microbial intervention.",-1
Momordica charantia L. extracts against Aedes aegypti larvae,"Mormodica charantia (Curcubitaceae) is a plant with great medicinal potential, also used as an alternative of mosquitoes control as demonstrated by previous studies. We evaluated the larvicidal activity of crude extracts of ethyl acetate, methanol and hexane from flowers and fruits of M. charantia against Aedes aegypti (Culicidae). Flowers and fruits were macerated in methanol, ethyl acetate and hexane. Bioassays were performed with application of the extracts at final concentrations of 1 - 200 Âµg/mL in the middle of the third instar larvae of A. aegypti (L3). The results showed high toxicity to ethyl acetate extracts from flowers and fruits at concentrations of 200 Âµg/mL and 100 Âµg/mL, with 97% and 87% of larvae mortality (L3), respectively. Hexane extract demonstrated low toxicity, while methanol extract exhibited 78% larval mortality. The data suggested that the ethyl acetate extracts of flowers and fruits of M. charantia can effectively contribute to larvicidal activity. In addition, purification of M. charantia extracts may lead to a promising larvicidal activity to control the A. aegypti population.",-1
Everybody nose: molecular and clinical characteristics of nasal colonization during active methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection,"Background:                    Healthcare-associated infections pose a potentially fatal threat to patients worldwide and Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of healthcare-associated infections. S. aureus is a common commensal pathogen and a frequent cause of bacteremia, with studies demonstrating that nasal and blood isolates from single patients match more than 80% of the time. Here we report on a contemporary collection of colonizing isolates from those with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections to evaluate the diversity within hosts, and detail the clinical features associated with concomitant nasal colonization.              Methods:                    Swabs of the bilateral anterior nares were obtained from patients diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia. A single colony culture from the blood and an average of 6 colonies from the nares were evaluated for MRSA growth. For the nares cultures, we typed multiple isolates for staphylococcal protein A (spa) and derived the clonal complexes. Demographic and clinical data were obtained retrospectively from the electronic medical record system and analysed using univariate and multivariable regression models.              Results:                    Over an 11-month period, 68 patients were diagnosed with MRSA bloodstream infection, 53 were swabbed, and 37 (70%) were colonized with MRSA in the anterior nares. We performed molecular typing on 213 nasal colonies. Spa types and clonal complexes found in the blood were also detected in the nares in 95% of the cases. We also found that 11% of patients carried more than one clone of MRSA in the nares. Male sex and history of prior hospitalization within the past 90 days increased odds for MRSA colonization.              Conclusion:                    The molecular epidemiological landscape of colonization in the setting of invasive disease is diverse and defining the interplay between colonization and invasive disease is critical to combating invasive MRSA disease.",-1
[The relation between residual Î²-cell function and autoimmune status in long-term type 1 diabetes patients],"Objective: We aimed to investigate the autoimmune status of long-term type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with residual Î²-cell function. Methods: The residual Î²-cell function of long-term (disease durationâ?0 years) autoimmune T1DM patients from the T1DM Integrated Management Clinic of the Second Xiangya Hospital was assessed by serum C-peptide levels. Patients with fasting or 2-hour postprandial C-peptide levels over the lower sensitivity limit of detection (16.7 pmol/L) were grouped as C-peptide-positive, and others were grouped as C-peptide-negative. We screened and enrolled all the C-peptide-positive patients (n=19). C-peptide-negative patients with matched sex, age, duration, BMI (n=19) and healthy controls (n=19) were recruited at the same time. The frequencies of CD4+T cell (Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg) and B cell (MZB/FoB/B10) subsets, the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 on T and B lymphocytes, and the levels of T1DM related cytokines including IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-1RA, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-23 and IP-10 were tested. We compared these parameters in patients with different levels of Î²-cell function. Results: In healthy controls, C-peptide-negative and C-peptide-positive patients, the frequencies M (Q1, Q3) of Th1 cells were 9.93% (7.45%, 15.20%), 14.90% (11.70%, 18.00%) and 10.20% (6.93%, 15.80%) (P=0.015), and the frequencies M (Q1, Q3) of Treg cells were 3.52% (2.92%, 5.68%),2.88% (1.64%, 3.22%) and 3.12% (2.81%, 4.81%) (P=0.005), and the frequencies M(Q1,Q3) of PD-1+B cells were 4.69% (2.64%, 6.37%), 2.11% (1.45%, 3.63%) and 4.20% (2.53%, 6.01%) (P=0.003), respectively. The levels of IL-6 M(Q1,Q3)were 26.43(18.06, 33.35) ng/L, 42.97 (25.52, 66.30) ng/L, and 22.07 (14.85, 34.45) ng/L (P=0.006), and the levels of IP-10 M(Q1,Q3) were 107.39 (76.19, 126.07) ng/L, 188.82 (131.27, 348.18) ng/L and 128.26 (114.31, 136.50) ng/L (P<0.001) in healthy controls, C-peptide-negative and C-peptide-positive patients, respectively. Compared with C-peptide-positive patients, the frequency of Th1 cells and the levels of IL-6 and IP-10 cytokines were higher, while the frequencies of Treg cells and PD-1+B cells were lower in C-peptide-negative patients (all P<0.05). Conclusions: Long-term T1DM patients with residual Î²-cell function had lower frequency of Th1 cells, lower levels of IL-6, IP-10 cytokines, and higher frequencies of Treg and PD-1+B cells, which indicated a pronounced autoimmune tolerance.",-1
Defective viral genomes as therapeutic interfering particles against flavivirus infection in mammalian and mosquito hosts,"Arthropod-borne viruses pose a major threat to global public health. Thus, innovative strategies for their control and prevention are urgently needed. Here, we exploit the natural capacity of viruses to generate defective viral genomes (DVGs) to their detriment. While DVGs have been described for most viruses, identifying which, if any, can be used as therapeutic agents remains a challenge. We present a combined experimental evolution and computational approach to triage DVG sequence space and pinpoint the fittest deletions, using Zika virus as an arbovirus model. This approach identifies fit DVGs that optimally interfere with wild-type virus infection. We show that the most fit DVGs conserve the open reading frame to maintain the translation of the remaining non-structural proteins, a characteristic that is fundamental across the flavivirus genus. Finally, we demonstrate that the high fitness DVG is antiviral in vivo both in the mammalian host and the mosquito vector, reducing transmission in the latter by up to 90%. Our approach establishes the method to interrogate the DVG fitness landscape, and enables the systematic identification of DVGs that show promise as human therapeutics and vector control strategies to mitigate arbovirus transmission and disease.",-1
Visualization of the fat planes between the pancreas and the adjacent organs and blood vessels using multi-detector computed tomography,"Purpose:                    To explore individual variations in visibility of the fat planes between the pancreatic parenchyma and adjacent organs and blood vessels using the multi-detector-computed tomography (MDCT).              Methods:                    Abdominal contrast-enhanced MDCT examinations of 520 consecutive adult individuals were retrospectively analysed by exploring the presence of visible fat planes between the healthy pancreas and the following surrounding structures: stomach, descending duodenum (D2), splenic, portal, superior mesenteric vein (SV, PV, SMV), inferior vena cava (IVC), and coeliac trunk, common hepatic and superior mesenteric artery (CT, HA and SMA). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rS) was used to assess the correlation of individual gender, age, body mass and BMI, and visible fat planes towards particular surrounding structures.              Results:                    Fat planes between the pancreatic parenchyma and surrounding structures was visible as follows: stomach in 76%, D2 11.7%, SV 51.5%, PV 0%, SMV 28.8%, IVC 80.8%, CT 99.4%, HA 90.4% and SMA in 100% participants. The presence of visible fat planes significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with body mass for stomach (rS = 0.367), D2 (rS = 0.247), SV (rS = 0.355), SMV (rS = 0.384) and IVC (rS = 0.259); BMI for stomach (rS = 0.292), SV (rS = 0.248), SMV (rS = 0.290) and IVC (rS = 0.216); age for D2 (rS = 0.363), SV (rS = 0.276) and SMV (rS = 0.409); and male gender for stomach (rS = 0.160) and SV (rS = 0.198).              Conclusion:                    Fat planes around the pancreatic parenchyma in the MDCT scan was almost always visible towards the adjacent magistral visceral arteries and IVC, always invisible towards the PV, and variably visible towards the SV, SMV, stomach and duodenum depending on the individual body mass, BMI, age and gender.",-1
Non-coding RNAs in the regulation of blood-brain barrier functions in central nervous system disorders,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an essential component of the neurovascular unit that controls the exchanges of various biological substances between the blood and the brain. BBB damage is a common feature of different central nervous systems (CNS) disorders and plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of the diseases. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are important regulatory RNA molecules that are involved in almost all cellular processes in normal development and various diseases, including CNS diseases. Cumulative evidences have demonstrated ncRNA regulation of BBB functions in different CNS diseases. In this review, we have summarized the miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs that can be served as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for BBB injuries, and demonstrated the involvement and underlying mechanisms of ncRNAs in modulating BBB structure and function in various CNS diseases, including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), brain tumors, brain infections, diabetes, sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), and others. We have also discussed the pharmaceutical drugs that can regulate BBB functions via ncRNAs-related signaling cascades in CNS disorders, along with the challenges, perspective, and therapeutic potential of ncRNA regulation of BBB functions in CNS diseases.",-1
[Evaluation of brain injury caused by stick type blunt instruments based on convolutional neural network and finite element method],"The finite element method is a new method to study the mechanism of brain injury caused by blunt instruments. But it is not easy to be applied because of its technology barrier of time-consuming and strong professionalism. In this study, a rapid and quantitative evaluation method was investigated to analyze the craniocerebral injury induced by blunt sticks based on convolutional neural network and finite element method. The velocity curve of stick struck and the maximum principal strain of brain tissue (cerebrum, corpus callosum, cerebellum and brainstem) from the finite element simulation were used as the input and output parameters of the convolutional neural network The convolutional neural network was trained and optimized by using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Goodness of Fit ( R 2) of the finally selected convolutional neural network model for the prediction of the maximum principal strain of the cerebrum were 0.084, 0.014, and 0.92, respectively. The predicted results of the maximum principal strain of the corpus callosum were 0.062, 0.007, 0.90, respectively. The predicted results of the maximum principal strain of the cerebellum and brainstem were 0.075, 0.011, and 0.94, respectively. These results show that the research and development of the deep convolutional neural network can quickly and accurately assess the local brain injury caused by the sticks blow, and have important application value for understanding the quantitative evaluation and the brain injury caused by the sticks struck. At the same time, this technology improves the computational efficiency and can provide a basis reference for transforming the current acceleration-based brain injury research into a focus on local brain injury research.",-1
Women's Choice to Deliver at Home: Understanding the Psychosocial and Cultural Factors Influencing Birthing Choices for Unskilled Home Delivery among Women in Southwestern Uganda,"Background:                    Utilization of perinatal services in Uganda remains low, with correspondingly high rates of unskilled home deliveries, which can be life-threatening. We explored psychosocial and cultural factors influencing birthing choices for unskilled home delivery among postpartum women in rural southwestern Uganda.              Methods:                    We conducted in-depth qualitative face-to-face interviews with 30 purposively selected women between December 2018 and March 2019 to include adult women who delivered from their homes and health facility within the past three months. Women were recruited from 10 villages within 20 km from a referral hospital. Using the constructs of the Health Utilization Model (HUM), interview topics were developed. Interviews were conducted and digitally recorded in a private setting by a native speaker to elicit choices and experiences during pregnancy and childbirth. Translated transcripts were generated and coded. Coded data were iteratively reviewed and sorted to derive categories using inductive content analytic approach.              Results:                    Eighteen women (60%) preferred to deliver from home. Women's referent birth location was largely intentional. Overall, the data suggest women choose home delivery (1) because of their financial dependency and expectation for a ""natural"" and normal childbirth, affecting their ability and need to seek skilled facility delivery; (2) as a means of controlling their own birth processes; (3) out of dissatisfaction with facility-based care; (4) out of strong belief in fate regarding birth outcomes; (5) because they have access to alternative sources of birthing help within their communities, perceived as ""affordable,"" ""supportive,"" and ""convenient""; and (6) as a result of existing gender and traditional norms that limit their ability and freedom to make family or health decisions as women.              Conclusion:                    Women's psychosocial and cultural understandings of pregnancy and child birth, their established traditions, birth expectations, and perceptions of control, need, and quality of maternity care at a particular birthing location influenced their past and future decisions to pursue home delivery. Interventions to address barriers to healthcare utilization through a multipronged approach could help to debunk misconceptions, increase perceived need, and motivate women to seek facility delivery.",-1
Parent-Adolescent Communication Influences on Anxious and Depressive Symptoms in Early Adolescence,"The unique developmental changes and important role of parents during early adolescence warrants consideration of parent-adolescent communication, including open communication, co-problem-solving, and co-rumination, and its influences on adolescents' anxious and depressive symptoms. In this study, 400 early adolescents (M age = 12.49; 54% female) recruited from a middle school completed electronic questionnaires at two time points, 5 months apart. While most bivariate associations examined between communication processes and adolescents' symptoms were significant, path analyses found unique patterns. Specifically, over time, paternal open communication was negatively associated with adolescent anxious and depressive symptoms while paternal co-rumination was positively associated with depressive, but not anxious, symptoms. In contrast, few maternal communication factors were significantly linked to adolescents' internalizing symptoms, with only maternal co-rumination surprisingly being negatively linked to depressive symptoms over time. The results suggest how parents communicate with their children may be important as early adolescents develop problem-solving and adaptive coping skills to successfully navigate new experiences.",-1
The Role of DNA Repair in Genomic Instability of Multiple Myeloma,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy marked by genomic instability that arises both through pathogenesis and during disease progression. Despite recent advances in therapy, MM remains incurable. Recently, it has been reported that DNA repair can influence genomic changes and drug resistance in MM. The dysregulation of DNA repair function may provide an alternative explanation for genomic instability observed in MM cells and in cells derived from MM patients. This review provides an overview of DNA repair pathways with a special focus on their involvement in MM and discusses the role they play in MM progression and drug resistance. This review highlights how unrepaired DNA damage due to aberrant DNA repair response in MM exacerbates genomic instability and chromosomal abnormalities, enabling MM progression and drug resistance.",-1
"Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGEs): Formation, Chemistry, Classification, Receptors, and Diseases Related to AGEs","Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) constitute a non-homogenous, chemically diverse group of compounds formed either exogeneously or endogeneously on the course of various pathways in the human body. In general, they are formed non-enzymatically by condensation between carbonyl groups of reducing sugars and free amine groups of nucleic acids, proteins, or lipids, followed by further rearrangements yielding stable, irreversible end-products. In the last decades, AGEs have aroused the interest of the scientific community due to the increasing evidence of their involvement in many pathophysiological processes and diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, and even infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They are recognized by several cellular receptors and trigger many signaling pathways related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Despite many experimental research outcomes published recently, the complexity of their engagement in human physiology and pathophysiological states requires further elucidation. This review focuses on the receptors of AGEs, especially on the structural aspects of receptor-ligand interaction, and the diseases in which AGEs are involved. It also aims to present AGE classification in subgroups and to describe the basic processes leading to both exogeneous and endogeneous AGE formation.",-1
Sex-Dependent Differential Expression of Lipidic Mediators Associated with Inflammation Resolution in Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis,"There is a sex bias in tuberculosis's severity, prevalence, and pathogenesis, and the rates are higher in men. Immunological and physiological factors are fundamental contributors to the development of the disease, and sex-related factors could play an essential role in making women more resistant to severe forms of the disease. In this study, we evaluated sex-dependent differences in inflammatory markers. Serum samples were collected from 34 patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB (19 male and 15 female) and 27 healthy controls (18 male and 9 female). Cytokines IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IFNÎ³, TNFÎ±, and GM-CSF, and eicosanoids PGE2, LTB4, RvD1, and Mar1 were measured using commercially available immunoassays. The MDA, a product of lipidic peroxidation, was measured by detecting thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Differential inflammation patterns between men and women were observed. Men had higher levels of IL6, IL8, and TNFÎ± than women. PGE2 and LTB4 levels were higher in patients than healthy controls, but there were no differences for RvD1 and Mar1. Women had higher RvD1/PGE2 and RvD1/LTB4 ratios among patients. RvD1 plays a vital role in resolving the inflammatory process of TB in women. Men are the major contributors to the typical pro-inflammatory profile observed in the serum of tuberculosis patients.",-1
Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning Prediction of Disease Outcomes for COVID-19 and Pneumonia Patients,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world and impacted many people's lives. The characteristics of COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia have both similarities and differences, which confused doctors initially to separate and understand them. Here we presented a retrospective analysis for both COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia by combining the COVID-19 clinical data, eICU and MIMIC-III databases. Machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost and deep learning neural networks, were developed to predict the severity of COVID-19 infections as well as the mortality of pneumonia patients in intensive care units (ICU). Statistical analysis and feature interpretation, including the analysis of two-level attention mechanisms on both temporal and non-temporal features, were utilized to understand the associations between different clinical variables and disease outcomes. For the COVID-19 data, the XGBoost model obtained the best performance on the test set (AUROC = 1.000 and AUPRC = 0.833). On the MIMIC-III and eICU pneumonia datasets, our deep learning model (Bi-LSTM_Attn) was able to identify clinical variables associated with death of pneumonia patients (AUROC = 0.924 and AUPRC = 0.802 for 24-hour observation window and 12-hour prediction window). The results highlighted clinical indicators, such as the lymphocyte counts, that may help the doctors to predict the disease progression and outcomes for both COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia.",-1
Frequency and Characteristics of Psychosis in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Background:                    Psychotic symptoms are highly frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and are associated with poor prognosis. They include hallucinations, delusions, and minor psychotic phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations, and illusions.              Objective:                    To evaluate the frequency of psychosis in PD patients.              Methods:                    A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies reporting the frequency of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusions in PD.              Results:                    Electronic database search wielded 3536 articles, an additional 91 were identified through citation chaining. Of these, 163 were fully inspected, 57 removed, and 106 included as relevant for neuropsychiatric events frequency, with 32 meeting our inclusion criteria (psychosis and/or specific psychotic phenomena). The pooled frequency of psychosis was 20.7% (95% CI 14.5 to 28.6; I2 = 94%, 15 studies; combined n = 2919). None of the pre-defined meta-regressions or subgroup analyses were statistically significant or helped explain the statistical heterogeneity. The pooled frequency of any form of hallucination was 21.6% (95% CI 14.7 to 30.6; I2 = 95%; 18 studies; combined n = 3161). Duration of PD at baseline and mean baseline Hoehn & Yahr stage helped explain the statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis of hallucinations.              Conclusion:                    Based on the available evidence, around a fifth of PD patients experience psychosis or hallucinations. The risk of developing hallucinations is likely moderated by the disease duration, Hoehn & Yahr stage, and the cognitive status.",-1
Noncoding RNAs in age-related cardiovascular diseases,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the adult population worldwide and represent a severe economic burden and public health concern. The majority of human genes do not code for proteins. However, noncoding transcripts play important roles in ageing that significantly increases the risk for CVDs. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are critical regulators of multiple biological processes related to ageing such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. NcRNAs are also involved in pathophysiological developments within the cardiovascular system including arrhythmias, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocardial infarction and heart failure. In this review article, we cover the roles of ncRNAs in cardiovascular ageing and disease as well as their potential therapeutic applications in CVDs.",-1
You Are the Future: Embodied History in China's Psy-boom,"Ms. Zhou, Ms. Liu, and Ms. Wen represent three generations of psychological counselors in China. They all work in Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan province. China is in the midst of what scholars call the ""psy-boom."" This is generally defined as the rapid rise in psychological services in the country. Rather than understanding this rise as a linear phenomenon or one in which the understanding of psychology and its uses are universally shared by all practitioners, these three therapists show how haphazard and staggered the uptake in psychological services has been. They also show how the different historical contexts and shifting qualification standards that defined their generation of the psy-boom in turn shaped their therapeutic practice. The study uses Bourdieu's concept of the habitus to show how the embodied history of China's psy-boom impacts the practice of counselling and understanding of psychology.",-1
Off with their heads: analysis of the circadian clock genes expression in the body of Aedes aegypti,"The circadian clock of mosquitoes can influence physiological and behavioral processes linked to disease transmission. Currently, we know how clock genes are expressed in the head of the Aedes aegypti in different light and temperature regimens, but we still do not know anything about the expression of these genes in the body. The present work aims to contribute to this understanding. We observed that the expression of clock genes in the body of Aedes can be different from that in the head. Additionally, we found that temperature cycles have greater influence on the clock genes of the body of Aedes than light/dark cycles.",-1
Consequences of nano and microplastic exposure in rodent models: the known and unknown,"The ubiquitous nature of micro- (MP) and nanoplastics (NP) is a growing environmental concern. However, their potential impact on human health remains unknown. Research increasingly focused on using rodent models to understand the effects of exposure to individual plastic polymers. In vivo data showed critical exposure effects depending on particle size, polymer, shape, charge, concentration, and exposure routes. Those effects included local inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic disruption, leading to gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, reproduction disorders, and neurotoxic effects. This review distillates the current knowledge regarding rodent models exposed to MP and NP with different experimental designs assessing biodistribution, bioaccumulation, and biological responses. Rodents exposed to MP and NP showed particle accumulation in several tissues. Critical responses included local inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to microbiota dysbiosis, metabolic, hepatic, and reproductive disorders, and diseases exacerbation. Most studies used MP and NP commercially provided and doses higher than found in environmental exposure. Hence, standardized sampling techniques and improved characterization of environmental MP and NP are needed and may help in toxicity assessments of relevant particle mixtures, filling knowledge gaps in the literature.",-1
Identification of effective features of LFP signal for making closed-loop deep brain stimulation in parkinsonian rats,"Traditional deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of the acceptable methods to relieve the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease in its advanced stages. Today, the use of closed-loop DBS to increase stimulation efficiency and patient satisfaction is one of the most important issues under investigation. The present study was aimed to find local field potential (LFP) features of parkinsonian rats, which can determine the timing of stimulation with high accuracy. The LFP signals from rats were recorded in three groups of parkinsonian rat models receiving stimulation (stimulation), without getting stimulation (off-stimulation), and sham-controlled group. The frequency domain and chaotic features of signals were extracted for classifying three classes by support vector machine (SVM) and neural networks. The best combination of features was selected using the genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, the effective features were introduced to determine the on/off stimulation time, and the optimal stimulation parameters were identified. It was found that a combination of frequency domain and chaotic features with an accuracy of about 99% was able to determine the time the DBS must switch on. In about 80.67% of the 1861 different stimulation parameters, the brain was able to maintain its state for about 3 min after stimulation discontinuation.",-1
Development of Temporal Model for Forecasting of Helicoverpa armigera (Noctuidae: Lepidopetra) Using Arima and Artificial Neural Networks,"Helicoverpa armigera (HÃ¼bner) (Noctuidae: Lepidopetra) is a polyphagous pest of major crops grown in India. To prevent the damage caused by H. armigera farmers rely heavily on insecticides of diverse groups on a regular basis which is not a benign practice, environmentally and economically. To provide more efficient and accurate information on timely application of insecticides, this research was aimed to develop a forecast model to predict population dynamics of pod borer using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The data used in this study were collected from the randomly installed sex pheromone traps at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Hyderabad. Several ARIMA (p, d, q) (P, D, Q) and ANN models were developed using the historical trap catch data. ARIMA model (1,0,1), (1,0,2) with minimal BIC, RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and MASE values and higher R2 value (0.53) was selected as the best ARIMA fit model, and neural network (7-30-1) was found to be the best fit to predict the catches of male moths of pod borer from September 2021 to August 2023. A comparative analysis performed between the ARIMA and ANN, shows that the ANN based on feed forward neural networks is best suited for effective pest prediction. With the developed ARIMA model, it would be easier to predict H. armigera adult population dynamics round the year and timely intervention of control measures can be followed by appropriate decision-making schedule for insecticide application.",-1
Rift Valley Fever and West Nile virus vectors in Morocco: Current situation and future anticipated scenarios,"Rift Valley Fever (RVF) and West Nile virus (WNV) are two important emerging Arboviruses transmitted by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, typically Ae. caspius, Ae. detritus and Cx. pipiens in temperate regions. In Morocco, several outbreaks of WNV (1996, 2003 and 2010), affecting horses mostly, have been reported in north-western regions resulting in the death of 55 horses and one person cumulatively. Serological evidence of WNV local circulation, performed one year after the latest outbreak, revealed WNV neutralizing bodies in 59 out of 499 tested participants (El Rhaffouli et al., 2012). The country also shares common borders with northern Mauritania, where RVF is often documented. Human movement, livestock trade, climate changes and the availability of susceptible mosquito vectors are expected to increase the spread of these diseases in the country. Thus, in this study, we gathered a data set summarizing occurrences of Ae. caspius, Ae. detritus and Cx. pipiens in the country, and generated model prediction for their potential distribution under both current and future (2050) climate conditions, as a proxy to identify regions at-risk of RVF and WNV probable expansion. We found that the north-western regions (where the population is most concentrated), specifically along the Atlantic coastline, are highly suitable for Ae. caspius, Ae. detritus and Cx. pipiens, under present-day conditions. Future model scenarios anticipated possible range changes for the three mosquitoes under all climatic assumptions. All of the studied species are prospected to gain new areas that are currently not suitable, even under the most optimist scenario, thus placing additional human populations at risk. Our maps and predictions offer an opportunity to strategically target surveillance and control programmes. Public health officials, entomological surveillance and control delegation must augment efforts and continuously monitor these areas to reduce and minimize human infection risk.",-1
The effect of fasting or calorie restriction on mitophagy induction: a literature review,"Mitochondrial dysfunction can be a major cause of a wide range of age-related diseases. Maintaining the normal homeostasis of mitochondria population plays an important role in ensuring people's health, which is done through the mitophagy process. Among the various stimuli for the onset of mitophagy, caloric restriction (CR) is one of the strongest non-genetic triggers for initiating the mitophagy process. The primary objective of this paper is to review the literature assessing the effect of CR on mitophagy. Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases was searched from inception to 1 August 2019. Reference lists from all selected articles were also examined for additional relevant studies. The evidence regarding the effect of fasting or CR on mitophagy is still limited. In addition, the methodological approaches of the studies are too heterogeneous in terms of types of food restriction, study duration, and targeted tissues. Most of the studies showed that fasting or CR induced mitophagy and mitophagy-related markers such as Binp3 and Parkin. However, some studies demonstrated that mitophagy occurred both in fasting and fed state with no significant differences or may be induced in fed state. Study on the muscle tissue of subjects after exercise showed that mitophagy was upregulated in the fed state. It has been demonstrated that mitophagy in the muscle was lowered in the absence of AMP-dependent kinase and fibroblast growth factor 21 genes, both in fasted and fed conditions. Current evidence overwhelmingly suggests that CR and fasting induce mitophagy and mitophagy-related markers. Based on the current evidence that we reviewed here, it could be concluded that fasting or CR has a promising role as a novel and practical approach in the prevention of age-related diseases without any side effects by inducing mitophagy in different organs of the body. More studies will be required in future to clarify the relationship between food deprivation and mitophagy. Further studies using a variety of different types of CR and fasting states are also warranted to determine the best approach for inducing mitophagy and improving health.",-1
MiR-1270 Suppresses the Malignant Progression of Breast Cancer via Targeting MMD2,"We aimed to detect the clinical significance of microRNA-1270 (miR-1270) in breast cancer (BCa) development and its potential influence on malignant phenotypes of BCa cells. The miR-1270 level in paired BCa and paracancerous tissues was detected. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for the prognosis analysis of miR-1270 in BCa. The biofunctions of miR-1270 in apoptosis and proliferation of breast cancer cells were evaluated. Downstream target of miR-1270 was predicted and confirmed. The involvement of monocyte to macrophage differentiation associated 2 (MMD2) in BCa development was finally illustrated. miR-1270 was lowly expressed in BCa tissues. Lowly expressed miR-1270 was associated with tumor staging, larger tumor size, and also worse prognostic results in patients with BCa. miR-1270 overexpression suppressed proliferation and increased apoptotic rate of BCa cells. Further exploration showed that MMD2 might be the target of miR-1270. MMD2 was upregulated in BCa tissues and negatively correlated to miR-1270 level. Importantly, MMD2 significantly neutralized the above biofunctions of miR-1270 in malignant phenotypes of BCa. Lowly expressed miR-1270 is a hallmark of poor prognosis in patients with BCa. It inhibits proliferative ability and increases apoptosis in BCa by negatively regulating the MMD2 level.",-1
Obesity programmed by prenatal dexamethasone and postnatal high-fat diet leads to distinct alterations in nutrition sensory signals and circadian-clock genes in visceral adipose tissue,"Background:                    Prenatal dexamethasone treatment has been shown to enhance the susceptibility of offspring to postnatal high-fat (HF) diet-induced programmed obesity. We investigated the metabolic phenotypes, nutrient-sensing signal and circadian-clock genes in adipose tissue that are programmed by prenatal dexamethasone exposure and postnatal HF diet.              Methods:                    Male offspring of Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups: normal diet, prenatal dexamethasone exposure, postnatal HF diet, and prenatal dexamethasone plus postnatal HF diet. Postnatal HF diet was prescribed from weaning to 6 months of age.              Results:                    Prenatal dexamethasone and postnatal HF diet exerted synergistic effects on body weight and visceral adiposity, whereas prenatal dexamethasone and postnatal HF diet altered the metabolic profile and caused leptin dysregulation. Prenatal dexamethasone and postnatal HF diet distinctly influenced nutrient-sensing molecules and circadian-clock genes in adipose tissue. The mRNA expression of mTOR, AMPK-Î±2, PPAR-Î±, and PPAR-Î³ was suppressed by prenatal dexamethasone but enhanced by postnatal HF diet.              Conclusion:                    Prenatal dexamethasone and postnatal HF treatment cause dysregulation of nutrient-sensing molecules and circadian-clock genes in visceral adipose tissue. Characterizing altered nutrient-sensing molecules and circadian-clock genes has potential therapeutic relevance with respect to the pathogenesis and treatment of prenatal stress and postnatal HF diet-related metabolic disorders.",-1
Additional evidence on the efficacy of different Akirin vaccines assessed on Anopheles arabiensis (Diptera: Culicidae),"Background:                    Anopheles arabiensis is an opportunistic malaria vector that rests and feeds outdoors, circumventing current indoor vector control methods. Furthermore, this vector will readily feed on both animals and humans. Targeting this vector while feeding on animals can provide an additional intervention for the current vector control activities. Previous results have displayed the efficacy of using Subolesin/Akirin ortholog vaccines for the control of multiple ectoparasite infestations. This made Akirin a potential antigen for vaccine development against An. arabiensis.              Methods:                    The efficacy of three antigens, namely recombinant Akirin from An. arabiensis, recombinant Akirin from Aedes albopictus, and recombinant Q38 (Akirin/Subolesin chimera) were evaluated as novel interventions for An. arabiensis vector control. Immunisation trials were conducted based on the concept that mosquitoes feeding on vaccinated balb/c mice would ingest antibodies specific to the target antigen. The antibodies would interact with the target antigen in the arthropod vector, subsequently disrupting its function.              Results:                    All three antigens successfully reduced An. arabiensis survival and reproductive capacities, with a vaccine efficacy of 68-73%.              Conclusions:                    These results were the first to show that hosts vaccinated with recombinant Akirin vaccines could develop a protective response against this outdoor malaria transmission vector, thus providing a step towards the development of a novel intervention for An. arabiensis vector control.",-1
StimFit-A Data-Driven Algorithm for Automated Deep Brain Stimulation Programming,"Background:                    Finding the optimal deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters from a multitude of possible combinations by trial and error is time consuming and requires highly trained medical personnel.              Objective:                    We developed an automated algorithm to identify optimal stimulation settings in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS based on imaging-derived metrics.              Methods:                    Electrode locations and monopolar review data of 612 stimulation settings acquired from 31 PD patients were used to train a predictive model for therapeutic and adverse stimulation effects. Model performance was then evaluated within the training cohort using cross-validation and on an independent cohort of 19 patients. We inverted the model by applying a brute-force approach to determine the optimal stimulation sites in the target region. Finally, an optimization algorithm was established to identify optimal stimulation parameters. Suggested stimulation parameters were compared to the ones applied in clinical practice.              Results:                    Predicted motor outcome correlated with observed outcome (R = 0.57, P < 10-10 ) across patients within the training cohort. In the test cohort, the model explained 28% of the variance in motor outcome differences between settings. The stimulation site for maximum motor improvement was located at the dorsolateral border of the STN. When compared to two empirical settings, model-based suggestions more closely matched the setting with superior motor improvement.              Conclusion:                    We developed and validated a data-driven model that can suggest stimulation parameters leading to optimal motor improvement while minimizing the risk of stimulation-induced side effects. This approach might provide guidance for DBS programming in the future. Â© 2021 The Authors.

Pesticide-induced disturbances of bee gut microbiotas,"Social bee gut microbiotas play key roles in host health and performance. Worryingly, a growing body of literature shows that pesticide exposure can disturb these microbiotas. Most studies examine changes in taxonomic composition in Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiotas caused by insecticide exposure. Core bee gut microbiota taxa shift in abundance after exposure but are rarely eliminated, with declines in Bifidobacteriales and Lactobacillus near melliventris abundance being the most common shifts. Pesticide concentration, exposure duration, season and concurrent stressors all influence whether and how bee gut microbiotas are disturbed. Also, the mechanism of disturbance-i.e. whether a pesticide directly affects microbial growth or indirectly affects the microbiota by altering host health-likely affects disturbance consistency. Despite growing interest in this topic, important questions remain unanswered. Specifically, metabolic shifts in bee gut microbiotas remain largely uninvestigated, as do effects of pesticide-disturbed gut microbiotas on bee host performance. Furthermore, few bee species have been studied other than A. mellifera, and few herbicides and fungicides have been examined. We call for these knowledge gaps to be addressed so that we may obtain a comprehensive picture of how pesticides alter bee gut microbiotas, and of the functional consequences of these changes.",-1
"Transcriptomic, proteomic and ultrastructural studies on salinity-tolerant Aedes aegypti in the context of rising sea levels and arboviral disease epidemiology","Background:                    Aedes aegypti mosquito, the principal global vector of arboviral diseases, lays eggs and undergoes larval and pupal development to become adult mosquitoes in fresh water (FW). It has recently been observed to develop in coastal brackish water (BW) habitats of up to 50% sea water, and such salinity tolerance shown to be an inheritable trait. Genomics of salinity tolerance in Ae. aegypti has not been previously studied, but it is of fundamental biological interest and important for controlling arboviral diseases in the context of rising sea levels increasing coastal ground water salinity.              Results:                    BW- and FW-Ae. aegypti were compared by RNA-seq analysis on the gut, anal papillae and rest of the carcass in fourth instar larvae (L4), proteomics of cuticles shed when L4 metamorphose into pupae, and transmission electron microscopy of cuticles in L4 and adults. Genes for specific cuticle proteins, signalling proteins, moulting hormone-related proteins, membrane transporters, enzymes involved in cuticle metabolism, and cytochrome P450 showed different mRNA levels in BW and FW L4 tissues. The salinity-tolerant Ae. aegypti were also characterized by altered L4 cuticle proteomics and changes in cuticle ultrastructure of L4 and adults.              Conclusions:                    The findings provide new information on molecular and ultrastructural changes associated with salinity adaptation in FW mosquitoes. Changes in cuticles of larvae and adults of salinity-tolerant Ae. aegypti are expected to reduce the efficacy of insecticides used for controlling arboviral diseases. Expansion of coastal BW habitats and their neglect for control measures facilitates the spread of salinity-tolerant Ae. aegypti and genes for salinity tolerance. The transmission of arboviral diseases can therefore be amplified in multiple ways by salinity-tolerant Ae. aegypti and requires appropriate mitigating measures. The findings in Ae. aegypti have attendant implications for the development of salinity tolerance in other fresh water mosquito vectors and the diseases they transmit.",-1
Flight tone characterisation of the South American malaria vector Anopheles darlingi (Diptera: Culicidae),"Background:                    Flight tones play important roles in mosquito reproduction. Several mosquito species utilise flight tones for mate localisation and attraction. Typically, the female wingbeat frequency (WBF) is lower than males, and stereotypic acoustic behaviors are instrumental for successful copulation. Mosquito WBFs are usually an important species characteristic, with female flight tones used as male attractants in surveillance traps for species identification. Anopheles darlingi is an important Latin American malaria vector, but we know little about its mating behaviors.              Objectives:                    We characterised An. darlingi WBFs and examined male acoustic responses to immobilised females.              Methods:                    Tethered and free flying male and female An. darlingi were recorded individually to determine their WBF distributions. Male-female acoustic interactions were analysed using tethered females and free flying males.              Findings:                    Contrary to most mosquito species, An. darlingi females are smaller than males. However, the male's WBF is ~1.5 times higher than the females, a common ratio in species with larger females. When in proximity to a female, males displayed rapid frequency modulations that decreased upon genitalia engagement. Tethered females also modulated their frequency upon male approach, being distinct if the interaction ended in copulation or only contact.              Main conclusions:                    This is the first report of An. darlingi flight acoustics, showing that its precopulatory acoustics are similar to other mosquitoes despite the uncommon male:female size ratio, suggesting that WBF ratios are common communication strategies rather than a physical constraint imposed by size.",-1
PRP4 Induces Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Drug Resistance in Colon Cancer Cells via Activation of p53,"Pre-mRNA processing factor 4B (PRP4) promotes pre-mRNA splicing and signal transduction. Recent studies have shown that PRP4 modulates the assembly of actin cytoskeleton in cancer cells and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance. PRP4 displays kinase domain-like cyclin-dependent kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases, making it capable of phosphorylating p53 and other target proteins. In the current study, we report that PRP4 induces drug resistance and EMT via direct binding to the p53 protein, inducing its phosphorylation. Moreover, PRP4 overexpression activates the transcription of miR-210 in a hypoxia-inducible factor 1Î± (HIF-1Î±)-dependent manner, which activates p53. The involvement of miR-210 in the activation of p53 was confirmed by utilizing si-miR210. si-miR210 blocked the PRP4-activated cell survival pathways and reversed the PRP4-induced EMT phenotype. Moreover, we used deferoxamine as a hypoxia-mimetic agent, and si-HIF to silence HIF-1Î±. This procedure demonstrated that PRP4-induced EMT and drug resistance emerged in response to consecutive activation of HIF-1Î±, miR-210, and p53 by PRP4 overexpression. Collectively, our findings suggest that the PRP4 contributes to EMT and drug resistance induction via direct interactions with p53 and actions that promote upregulation of HIF-1Î± and miR-210. We conclude that PRP4 is an essential factor promoting cancer development and progression. Specific PRP4 inhibition could benefit patients with colon cancer.",-1
Insights on Genetic and Environmental Factors in Parkinson's Disease from a Regional Swedish Case-Control Cohort,"Background:                    Risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD) can be more or less relevant to a population due to population-specific genetic architecture, local lifestyle habits, and environmental exposures. Therefore, it is essential to study PD at a local, regional, and continental scale in order to increase the knowledge on disease etiology.              Objective:                    We aimed to investigate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to PD in a new Swedish case-control cohort.              Methods:                    PD patients (n = 929) and matched population-based controls (n = 935) from the southernmost county in Sweden were included in the cohort. Information on environmental exposures was obtained using questionnaires at inclusion. Genetic analyses included a genome-wide association study (GWAS), haplotype assessment, and a risk profile analysis using cumulative genetic risk scores.              Results:                    The cohort is a representative PD case-control cohort (64% men, mean age at diagnosis = 67 years, median Hoehn and Yahr score 2.0), in which previously reported associations between PD and environmental factors, such as tobacco, could be confirmed. We describe the first GWAS of PD solely composed of PD patients from Sweden, and confirm associations to well-established risk alleles in SNCA. In addition, we nominate an unconfirmed and potentially population-specific genome-wide significant association in the PLPP4 locus (rs12771445).              Conclusion:                    This work provides an in-depth description of a new PD case-control cohort from southern Sweden, giving insights into environmental and genetic risk factors for PD in the Swedish population.",-1
"Methylglyoxal Induces Inflammation, Metabolic Modulation and Oxidative Stress in Myoblast Cells","Uremic sarcopenia is a serious clinical problem associated with physical disability and increased morbidity and mortality. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive, dicarbonyl uremic toxin that accumulates in the circulatory system in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is related to the pathology of uremic sarcopenia. The pathophysiology of uremic sarcopenia is multifactorial; however, the details remain unknown. We investigated the mechanisms of MG-induced muscle atrophy using mouse myoblast C2C12 cells, focusing on intracellular metabolism and mitochondrial injury. We found that one of the causative pathological mechanisms of uremic sarcopenia is metabolic flow change to fatty acid synthesis with MG-induced ATP shortage in myoblasts. Evaluation of cell viability revealed that MG showed toxic effects only in myoblast cells, but not in myotube cells. Expression of mRNA or protein analysis revealed that MG induces muscle atrophy, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in myoblast cells. Target metabolomics revealed that MG induces metabolic alterations, such as a reduction in tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites. In addition, MG induces mitochondrial morphological abnormalities in myoblasts. These changes resulted in the reduction of ATP derived from the mitochondria of myoblast cells. Our results indicate that MG is a pathogenic factor in sarcopenia in CKD.",-1
Semiautomated Measure of Abdominal Adiposity Using Computed Tomography Scan Analysis,"Background:                    The obesity epidemic has prompted the need to better understand the impact of adipose tissue on human pathophysiology. However, accurate, efficient, and replicable models of quantifying adiposity have yet to be developed and clinically implemented. We propose a novel semiautomated radiologic method of measuring the visceral fat area (VFA) using computed tomography scan analysis.              Materials and methods:                    We obtained a cohort of 100 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, with a median age of 60.9 y (age range: 35-87 y) and an average body mass index of 28.8 kg/m2 Â± 6.56 kg/m2. The semiautomated quantification method of adiposity was developed using a commercial imaging suite. The method was compared to two manual delineations performed using two different picture archiving communication systems. We quantified VFA, subcutaneous fat area (SFA), total fat area (TFA), and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (V/S ratio) on computed tomography axial slices that were at the L4-L5 intervertebral level.              Results:                    The semiautomated method was comparable to manual measurements for TFA, VFA, and SFA with intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.99, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. However, the ICC for the V/S ratio was only 0.44, which led to the identification of technical outliers that were identified using robust regression. After removal of these outliers, the ICC improved to 0.99 for TFA, VFA, and SFA and 0.97 for the V/S ratio. Measurements from the manual methodology highly correlated between the two picture archiving communication system platforms, with ICC of 0.98 for TFA, 0.98 for VFA, 0.96 for SFA, and 0.95 for the V/S ratio.              Conclusions:                    This semiautomated method is able to generate precise and reproducible results. In the future, this method may be applied on a larger scale to facilitate risk stratification of patients using measures of abdominal adiposity.",-1
A neutrophil-mediated carrier regulates tumor stemness by inhibiting autophagy to prevent postoperative triple-negative breast cancer recurrence and metastasis,"Recurrence and metastasis after resection are still the main challenges in clinical treatment of breast cancer. Residual tumor and cancer stem-like cells are the primary culprits of recurrence and metastasis. Recent research studies indicate that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism of tumors, which maintains the stemness of cancer cells and promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis. Here, we constructed a ""Trojan horse"" using neutrophils as the carrier (PH-RL@NEs) to prevent the recurrence and metastasis of postoperative breast cancer. Neutrophils, as a ""Trojan horse,"" can quickly respond to postoperative inflammation and accurately deliver drugs to the residual tumor site. The inflammation-triggered ""Trojan horse"" was then opened to release the liposomes containing the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) and the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). We found that HCQ could effectively inhibit tumor cell autophagy, interfere with tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and reduce the tumor stem cell-like population. In the orthotopic 4T1 postoperative recurrence models, PTX and HCQ synergistically killed tumors and regulated the stemness of tumor cells, thereby significantly inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis. Our work proved that the inhibition of autophagy to reduce tumor stemness is feasible and effective, which opens up a new prospect for postoperative tumor treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The present study aimed to solve the issues of postoperative recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer and low efficiency of drug administration after surgery. For this purpose, we constructed neutrophils containing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and paclitaxel (PTX) co-loaded liposomes (PH-RL@NEs), which for the first time regulated the stemness of tumor cells by inhibiting autophagy, thereby inhibiting postoperative recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer cells. The results showed that PH-RL@NEs enhanced the targeted drug delivery efficiency, with the help of postoperative inflammation chemotaxis of neutrophils. HCQ effectively inhibited autophagy of tumor cells and reduced tumor stem cell-like cells, thus improving the therapeutic effect in the 4T1 in situ postoperative recurrence model.",-1
Automated interpretable discovery of heterogeneous treatment effectiveness: A COVID-19 case study,"Testing multiple treatments for heterogeneous (varying) effectiveness with respect to many underlying risk factors requires many pairwise tests; we would like to instead automatically discover and visualize patient archetypes and predictors of treatment effectiveness using multitask machine learning. In this paper, we present a method to estimate these heterogeneous treatment effects with an interpretable hierarchical framework that uses additive models to visualize expected treatment benefits as a function of patient factors (identifying personalized treatment benefits) and concurrent treatments (identifying combinatorial treatment benefits). This method achieves state-of-the-art predictive power for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality and interpretable identification of heterogeneous treatment benefits. We first validate this method on the large public MIMIC-IV dataset of ICU patients to test recovery of heterogeneous treatment effects. Next we apply this method to a proprietary dataset of over 3000 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, and find evidence of heterogeneous treatment effectiveness predicted largely by indicators of inflammation and thrombosis risk: patients with few indicators of thrombosis risk benefit most from treatments against inflammation, while patients with few indicators of inflammation risk benefit most from treatments against thrombosis. This approach provides an automated methodology to discover heterogeneous and individualized effectiveness of treatments.",-1
"Phytochemical Profiling of Lavandula coronopifolia Poir. Aerial Parts Extract and Its Larvicidal, Antibacterial, and Antibiofilm Activity Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Infections associated with the emergence of multidrug resistance and mosquito-borne diseases have resulted in serious crises associated with high mortality and left behind a huge socioeconomic burden. The chemical investigation of Lavandulacoronopifolia aerial parts extract using HPLC-MS/MS led to the tentative identification of 46 compounds belonging to phenolic acids, flavonoids and their glycosides, and biflavonoids. The extract displayed larvicidal activity against Culex pipiens larvae (LC50 = 29.08 Âµg/mL at 72 h). It significantly inhibited cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase (CYP450), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and carboxylesterase (CarE) enzymes with the comparable pattern to the control group, which could explain the mode of larvae toxification. The extract also inhibited the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 17-38% at different Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) (0.5-0.125 mg/mL) while the activity was doubled when combined with ciprofloxacin (ratio = 1:1 v:v). In conclusion, the wild plant, L.coronopifolia, can be considered a promising natural source against resistant bacteria and infectious carriers.",-1
Binding Interaction of Betulinic Acid to Î±-Glucosidase and Its Alleviation on Postprandial Hyperglycemia,"Inhibiting the intestinal Î±-glucosidase can effectively control postprandial hyperglycemia for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. In the present study, we reported the binding interaction of betulinic acid (BA), a pentacyclic triterpene widely distributed in nature, on Î±-glucosidase and its alleviation on postprandial hyperglycemia. BA was verified to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect against Î±-glucosidase with an IC50 value of 16.83 Â± 1.16 Î¼M. More importantly, it showed a synergistically inhibitory effect with acarbose. The underlying inhibitory mechanism was investigated by kinetics analysis, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculation. BA showed a non-competitive inhibition on Î±-glucosidase. SPR revealed that it had a strong and fast affinity to Î±-glucosidase with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) value of 5.529 Ã 10-5 M and a slow dissociation. Molecular docking and MD simulation revealed that BA bound to the active site of Î±-glucosidase mainly due to the van der Waals force and hydrogen bond, and then changed the micro-environment and secondary structure of Î±-glucosidase. Free energy decomposition indicated amino acid residues such as PHE155, PHE175, HIE277, PHE298, GLU302, TRY311 and ASP347 of Î±-glucosidase at the binding pocket had strong interactions with BA, while LYS153, ARG210, ARG310, ARG354 and ARG437 showed a negative contribution to binding affinity between BA and Î±-glucosidase. Significantly, oral administration of BA alleviated the postprandial blood glucose fluctuations in mice. This work may provide new insights into the utilization of BA as a functional food and natural medicine for the control of postprandial hyperglycemia.",-1
Monitoring Mosquito-Borne Arbovirus in Various Insect Regions in China in 2018,"Background:                    Increases in global travel and trade are changing arbovirus distributions worldwide. Arboviruses can be introduced by travelers, migratory birds, or vectors transported via international trade. Arbovirus surveillance in field-collected mosquitoes may provide early evidence for mosquito-borne disease transmission.              Methods:                    During the seasons of high mosquito activity of 2018, 29,285 mosquitoes were sampled from seven sentinel sites in various insect regions. The mosquitoes were analyzed by RT-PCR for alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and orthobunyaviruses.              Results:                    We detected three strains of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), five strains of Getah virus (GETV), and 45 strains of insect-specific flaviviruses including Aedes flavivirus (AeFV, 1), Chaoyang virus (CHAOV, 1), Culex flavivirus (CxFV, 17), Hanko virus (HANKV, 2), QuangBinh virus (QBV, 22), and Yunnan Culex flavivirus (YNCxFV, 2). Whole genomes of one strain each of GETV, CxFV, CHAOV, and AeFV were successfully amplified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new JEV strains detected in the Shanghai and Hubei Provinces belong to the GI-b strain and are phylogenetically close to the NX1889 strain (MT134112) isolated from a patient during a JE outbreak in Ningxia in 2018. GETVs were found in Inner Mongolia, Hubei, and Hainan and belonged to Group III. They were closely related to strains isolated from swine. HANKV was recorded for the first time in China and other ISFVs were newly detected at several sentinel sites. The bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimation value for JEV in Jinshan, Shanghai was 4.52/1,000 (range 0.80-14.64). Hence, there is a potential risk of a JEV epidemic in that region.              Conclusion:                    GI-b is the dominant circulating JEV genotype in nature and poses a health risk to animals and humans. The potential threat of widespread GETV distribution as a zoonosis is gradually increasing. The present study also disclosed the dispersion and host range of ISFVs. These findings highlight the importance of tracing the movements of the vectors and hosts of mosquito-borne pathogens in order to prevent and control arbovirus outbreaks in China.",-1
Chromosome-level genome assemblies of the malaria vectors Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles arabiensis,"Background:                    Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles arabiensis belong to the Anopheles gambiae complex and are among the major malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa. However, chromosome-level reference genome assemblies are still lacking for these medically important mosquito species.              Findings:                    In this study, we produced de novo chromosome-level genome assemblies for A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis using the long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology and the Hi-C scaffolding approach. We obtained 273.4 and 256.8 Mb of the total assemblies for A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis, respectively. Each assembly consists of 3 chromosome-scale scaffolds (X, 2, 3), complete mitochondrion, and unordered contigs identified as autosomal pericentromeric DNA, X pericentromeric DNA, and Y sequences. Comparison of these assemblies with the existing assemblies for these species demonstrated that we obtained improved reference-quality genomes. The new assemblies allowed us to identify genomic coordinates for the breakpoint regions of fixed and polymorphic chromosomal inversions in A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis.              Conclusion:                    The new chromosome-level assemblies will facilitate functional and population genomic studies in A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis. The presented assembly pipeline will accelerate progress toward creating high-quality genome references for other disease vectors.",-1
SNHG14 Upregulation Was a Molecular Mechanism Underlying MPP + Neurotoxicity in Dopaminergic SK-N-SH Cells via SNHG14-miR-519a-3p-ATG10 ceRNA Pathway,"Long non-coding RNA small nuclear RNA host gene 14 (SNHG14) is a novel contributor of dopaminergic neuronal injury in Parkinson's disease. We further explored its role in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-damaged dopaminergic neurons (DAn) and the possible mechanism involving SNHG14, microRNA (miR)-519a-3p, and autophagy-related 10 (ATG10). MPP+ cytotoxicity was measured by MTS cell viability assay, flow cytometry, and a series of assay kits for detecting apoptosis and oxidative stress. Molecule expression was examined by qPCR and Western blotting, and RNA interaction was predicted by starBase2.0 of ENCORI platform and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. SNHG14 and ATG10 expression was increased, and miR-519a-3p was decreased in MPP+-treated SK-N-SH cells, and SNHG14 knockdown alleviated MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cell damage by regulating cell viability, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Additionally, antisense RNA of miR-519a-3p abated the suppressive role of SNHG14 knockdown, and ectopic expression of ATG10 counteracted the protective role of miR-519a-3p against MPP+ neurotoxicity. Mechanistically, SNHG14 and ATG10 were competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for miR-519a-3p, and ATG10 expression could be positively modulated by SNHG14 via sponging miR-519a-3p. Target silencing SNHG14 and restoring miR-519a-3p could prevent DAn from MPP+ toxicity via regulation of ATG10.",-1

Towards a circulating marker of hepato-visceral fat excess: S100A4 in adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome - Evidence from randomized clinical trials,"S100A4 is a marker of subcutaneous adipose tissue dysfunction. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often driven by hepato-visceral adiposity. PCOS phenotypes are normalized more by reduction of central fat with spironolactone/pioglitazone/metformin (SPIOMET) than by oral contraceptive (OC) treatment. We studied whether circulating S100A4 concentrations are high in adolescents with PCOS and, if so, whether they normalize more with OC or SPIOMET. Assessments included circulating S100A4, endocrine markers, body composition, abdominal fat partitioning in controls (n = 12) and girls with PCOS (n = 51; age 15.8 y; body mass index [BMI] 24.5 kg/m2 ), and 1-year changes in girls with PCOS randomized for OC (n = 27) or SPIOMET (n = 24) treatment. Mean S100A4 concentrations were 71% higher (P < 0.001) in girls with PCOS than in controls and associated with hepato-visceral adiposity (r = 0.47; P = 0.001); S100A4 concentrations decreased more (P < 0.01) with SPIOMET, those decreases associating to hepato-visceral fat loss (r = 0.50; P < 0.0001). S100A4 may become a circulating marker of hepato-visceral fat excess in adolescents with PCOS.",-1
Effects of Ramadan Intermittent Fasting on Gut Hormones and Body Composition in Males with Obesity,"We studied the effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) on gut hormones (leptin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), cholecystokinin (CCK), and ghrelin) in males with obesity. Thirty sedentary males were randomly allocated to either an experimental group (EG, n = 15) or a control group (CG, n = 15). The EG group completed their Ramadan fasting rituals (30 days), whereas the CG continued with their normal daily habits. Blood samples were collected at four time points: 24 h before the start of Ramadan (T0), on the 15th day of Ramadan (T1), the day after the end of Ramadan (T2) and 21 days after Ramadan (T3). There were significant pre-to-post improvements for leptin (p = 0.01, d = 1.52), GLP-1 (p = 0.022, d = 0.75), PYY (p = 0.031, d = 0.69) and CCK (p = 0.027, d = 0.81) in the EG, with no interaction effect for ghrelin (p = 0.74; d = 0.008). No significant changes (p > 0.05) occurred in plasma volume variations (ÎPV) after RIF in both EG (-0.03 Â± 0.01%) and CG (0.06 Â± 0.07%). RIF represents an effective strategy to modify appetite-regulating hormones, leading to improved body composition indices and reduced obesity.",-1
The underlying rationality of Chinese medicine herb pair Coptis chinensis and Dolomiaea souliei: From the perspective of metabolomics and intestinal function,"Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    The combination of Coptis chinensis (RC) and Dolomiaea souliei (VR) has long been used as a classic herb pair for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.              Materials and methods:                    In this study, the rationality of evidence-based RC and VR combination was explored from the perspective of metabolism, gut microbiota and gastrointestinal function.              Results:                    After 5 weeks treatment, VR extracts (700 mg/kg) and RC alkaloids (800 mg/kg) showed no toxic effect on mice. However, RC administration significantly decreased the body weight of mice. Gastric emptying, gastrointestinal motility function and the absorption of FITC dextran were retarded in the mice of RC group, taking RC along with low dose VR (RC-VRL) and high dose VR (RC-VRH) reversed the impaired gastrointestinal function caused by RC. RC administration significantly increased villus height/crypt depth value. Notably, VR administration increased the number of crypts in mice ileum and reduced villus height/crypt depth value in VR and RC combination group. RC treatment significantly increased the expression of occludin compared to NC group; RC-VRL treatment reversed this tendency. While, VR administration increased ZO1 expression by 99.4% compared to NC mice. As for gut microbiota, RC gavage decreased the gut microbiota diversity, but gut microbiota in VR group was similar to NC group, and VR and RC combination increased gut microbiota diversity. RC administration obviously increased the proportion of Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Parabacteroides distasonis, and Escherichia coli, compared to NC mice. VR treatment increased the richness of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Parabacteroides distasonis. RC-VRL and RC-VRH treatment dose-dependently increased the richness of Rikenellaceae RC9, Lactobacillus, and decreased the abundance of Psychrobacter, Bacteroides and Ruminococcus in mice. Serum metabolomic analysis revealed that RC gavage significantly down regulated 76 metabolites and up regulated 31 metabolites. VR treatment significantly down regulated 30 metabolites and up regulated 12 metabolites. Weight loss caused by RC may attribute to the elevated methylxanthine level in mice. The potential adverse effects caused by high dose RC intake may partially alleviate by high serum contents of adenosine, inosine and urolithin A resulted from VR coadministration.              Conclusion:                    VR may alleviate RC caused ""fluid retention"" via normalizing gastrointestinal function, gut microbiota and modulating the perturbed metabolism.",-1
Multisite non-invasive brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease: A scoping review,"Background:                    Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by cardinal motor symptoms in addition to cognitive impairment. New insights concerning multisite non-invasive brain stimulation effects have been gained, which can now be used to develop innovative treatment approaches.              Objective:                    Map the researchs involving multisite non-invasive brain stimulation in PD, synthesize the available evidence and discuss future directions.              Methods:                    The databases PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception until April 2020, without restrictions on the date of publication or the language in which it was published. The reviewers worked in pairs and sequentially evaluated the titles, abstracts and then the full text of all publications identified as potentially relevant.              Results:                    Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria. The target brain regions included mainly the combination of a motor and a frontal area, such as stimulation of the primary motor cÃ³rtex associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Most of the trials showed that this modality was only more effective for the motor component, or for the cognitive and/or non-motor, separately.              Conclusions:                    Despite the results being encouraging for the use of the multisite aproach, the indication for PD management should be carried out with caution and deserves scientific deepening.",-1
The effect of a novel anticonvulsant chemical Q808 on gut microbiota and hippocampus neurotransmitters in pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in rats,"Background:                    The gut microbiota can modulate brain function and behavior and is increasingly recognized as an important factor in mediating the risk of epilepsy and the effects of seizure interventions. Drug therapy is one of the factors that influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Q808 is an innovative chemical with strong anticonvulsant activity and low neurotoxicity. However, studies evaluating the effect of Q808 on gut microbial communities are lacking. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anticonvulsant activity of Q808 on a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure model and analyze and compare the intestinal microbiota composition of non-PTZ vehicle control group, the PTZ-induced seizure model rats with and without Q808, through 16S rDNA sequencing. Neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus were quantitatively estimated using HPLC-MS.              Results:                    The results suggest that Q808 effectively alleviates seizures in chronic PTZ-kindled model rats. Additionally, based on the analyzed abundance of the gut microbiota, dysbacteriosis of model rats was found to be corrected after Q808 treatment at the phylum level. The unique bacterial taxa (e.g., Lactobacillus) that are associated with acetylcholine production, were significantly increased. Several short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, including Roseburia, Alloprevptella, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Prevotella_9, were enriched. In the hippocampus, the contents of acetylcholine increased, whereas the levels of 3-methoxytyramine, glutamine, and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) decreased after Q808 treatment.              Conclusions:                    This study demonstrates that Q808 can be used to remodel the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and influence neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus of PTZ-induced seizure model rats. We hope that these novel findings prompt further research on the interaction between gut microbiota and seizures and the mechanism of Q808.",-1
Yoghurt consumption is associated with changes in the composition of the human gut microbiome and metabolome,"Background:                    Yoghurt contains live bacteria that could contribute via modulation of the gut microbiota to its reported beneficial effects such as reduced body weight gain and lower incidence of type 2 diabetes. To date, the association between yoghurt consumption and the composition of the gut microbiota is underexplored. Here we used clinical variables, metabolomics, 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing data collected on over 1000 predominantly female UK twins to define the link between the gut microbiota and yoghurt-associated health benefits.              Results:                    According to food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), 73% of subjects consumed yoghurt. Consumers presented a healthier diet pattern (healthy eating index: beta = 2.17 Â± 0.34; P = 2.72x10-10) and improved metabolic health characterised by reduced visceral fat (beta = -28.18 Â± 11.71 g; P = 0.01). According to 16S rRNA gene analyses and whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing approach consistent taxonomic variations were observed with yoghurt consumption. More specifically, we identified higher abundance of species used as yoghurt starters Streptococcus thermophilus (beta = 0.41 Â± 0.051; P = 6.14x10-12) and sometimes added Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (beta = 0.30 Â± 0.052; P = 1.49x10-8) in the gut of yoghurt consumers. Replication in 1103 volunteers from the LifeLines-DEEP cohort confirmed the increase of S. thermophilus among yoghurt consumers. Using food records collected the day prior to faecal sampling we showed than an increase in these two yoghurt bacteria could be transient. Metabolomics analysis revealed that B. animalis subsp. lactis was associated with 13 faecal metabolites including a 3-hydroxyoctanoic acid, known to be involved in the regulation of gut inflammation.              Conclusions:                    Yoghurt consumption is associated with reduced visceral fat mass and changes in gut microbiome including transient increase of yoghurt-contained species (i.e. S. thermophilus and B. lactis).",-1
Efficacy of polydimethylsiloxane against Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae),"We evaluated, under controlled laboratory conditions, the insecticidal activity of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for the control of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens. In a first series of bioassays, we tested the residual effect of different PDMS doses to control 3rd instar larvae. The label dose caused high mortality rates (>80%) even after 50 days from the initial application. Mortality levels at half the label dose were significantly higher compared to control, during the entire experimental period following a gradual decrease over time. Similar trends were observed when the 1/4 and the 1/8 of the label dose were applied with a much steeper decrease at long time intervals since the initial application especially for the lowest dose. However, after the 10th day of the bioassays and until the end of the experiments, mortality rates in the case of the label dose were higher compared to all other doses after the initial 10 days post application. Conversely, the insecticidal efficacy of PDMS against pupae was generally lower in comparison with larvae. Indeed, 10 days after the application, mortality was notably reduced, regardless of the dose rate tested. In a second series of bioassays, we assessed the efficacy of short exposures of different instars of larvae and nymphs to registered formulation and label dose. Mortality was well over 95% for 2nd instar larvae at exposure intervals ranging from 1 to 4 days. Significant mortality was recorded to 3rd instar larvae even at 15 min of exposure. Exposures longer than 30 min caused high mortality rates to 3rd instar larvae. Similar results were also recorded in pupae. Finally, in a third series of bioassays, the efficacy of PDMS in egg hatch was tested. Egg hatch was completely suppressed in the treated substrate (all egg rafts were ""sinking"" at the bottom of the test cups). Moreover, there was no oviposition in the case of the application of the label dose, while some egg rafts were recorded at one-eighth of the label dose. In both cases, it was recorded that PDMS acts as an oviposition deterrent. Î¤he results of this study show that PDMS is effective in a wide range of conditions and application scenarios.",-1
Defective humoral immunity disrupts bile acid homeostasis which promotes inflammatory disease of the small bowel,"Mucosal antibodies maintain gut homeostasis by promoting spatial segregation between host tissues and luminal microbes. Whether and how mucosal antibody responses influence gut health through modulation of microbiota composition is unclear. Here, we use a CD19-/- mouse model of antibody-deficiency to demonstrate that a relationship exists between dysbiosis, defects in bile acid homeostasis, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy of the small intestine. The gluten-sensitive small intestine enteropathy that develops in CD19-/- mice is associated with alterations to luminal bile acid composition in the SI, marked by significant reductions in the abundance of conjugated bile acids. Manipulation of bile acid availability, adoptive transfer of functional B cells, and ablation of bacterial bile salt hydrolase activity all influence the severity of small intestine enteropathy in CD19-/- mice. Collectively, results from our experiments support a model whereby mucosal humoral immune responses limit inflammatory disease of the small bowel by regulating bacterial BA metabolism.",-1
Association between miRNA-499 gene polymorphism and autoimmune diseases: A meta-analysis,"Introduction:                    The association between miRNA-499 rs3746444 and a variety of autoimmune diseases has been reported. However, these results were contradictory and just focused on one or two autoimmune diseases. The present study aims to examine the possible association between rs3746444 polymorphism and the risk of autoimmune diseases.              Methods:                    The studies that evaluated the association between miRNA-499 gene polymorphism and autoimmune diseases were retrieved. Five different genetic models were used to evaluate the association. The random-effects model was used to pool the effect sizes. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the associations. Stratification analyses were performed by ethnicity and type of autoimmune diseases. False-positive report probability (FPRP) was performed for determining noteworthy associations.              Results:                    Seventeen articles (twenty studies) involving 4,376 cases and 4,991 controls were identified and included in our meta-analysis. The pooled ORs of all eligible case-control studies indicated a significant association between miRNA-499 gene polymorphism and autoimmune diseases: (T vs. C: OR = 0.877; 95% CI: 0.774, 0.993; P = 0.039). Stratified analysis indicated a significant association across both Caucasian (TT vs. TC+CC: OR = 0.779; 95% CI: 0.622, 0.976; P = 0.030) and Asian (T vs. C: OR = 0.895; 95% CI: 0.808, 0.992; P = 0.035) populations. There was also a significant association in Behcet's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis populations.              Conclusions:                    Our meta-analysis suggested that the miRNA-499 rs3746444 polymorphism was associated with an elevated risk of autoimmune diseases in the overall analysis as well as Caucasian and Asian populations.",-1
Dandelion pappus morphing is actuated by radially patterned material swelling,"Plants generate motion by absorbing and releasing water. Many Asteraceae plants, such as the dandelion, have a hairy pappus that can close depending on moisture levels to modify dispersal. Here we demonstrate the relationship between structure and function of the underlying hygroscopic actuator. By investigating the structure and properties of the actuator cell walls, we identify the mechanism by which the dandelion pappus closes. We developed a structural computational model that can capture observed pappus closing and used it to explore the critical design features. We find that the actuator relies on the radial arrangement of vascular bundles and surrounding tissues around a central cavity. This allows heterogeneous swelling in a radially symmetric manner to co-ordinate movements of the hairs attached at the upper flank. This actuator is a derivative of bilayer structures, which is radial and can synchronise the movement of a planar or lateral attachment. The simple, material-based mechanism presents a promising biomimetic potential in robotics and functional materials.",-1
Effects of Rhythmic Interventions on Cognitive Abilities in Parkinson's Disease,"Objective:                    The objective of this study is to compare 2 different rhythmic, high-intensive interventions, that is, rhythmic speech-language therapy (rSLT) versus rhythmic balance-mobility training (rBMT), against a no-therapy (NT) condition in patients with Parkinson's disease and against healthy controls (HCs) with regard to the change in or enhancement of cognitive abilities.              Methods:                    The 4 groups (rSLT: N = 16; rBMT: N = 10; NT: N = 18; and HC: N = 17) were matched for age, sex, and educational level and were tested in 6 cognitive domains: working memory, executive function, visuo-construction, episodic memory, attention, and word retrieval. Assessments took place at baseline, at 4 weeks (T1), and at 6 months (T2). Rhythmic interventions were provided 3 times per week for 4 weeks in total. To analyze true intervention effects between groups and across time, statistical analyses included reliable change index. Intergroup differences were assessed with multivariate assessment of variance, while differences within groups were assessed with 95% confidence intervals of mean difference.              Results:                    The rSLT improved working memory and word retrieval (p < 0.05), possibly a beneficial transfer effect of the training method per se. In contrast, the NT group worsened in phonemic and semantic shifting (p < 0.01). Observed improvements in flexibility and in episodic memory in the HC may be linked to training effects of retesting.              Conclusions:                    Rhythmic cues are resistant to neurodegeneration and have a strong motivating factor. As thus, these may facilitate high-intensive and demanding training. Although both trainings were superior to NT, the improvement of cognitive abilities depends on the specific training method. Further, therapy may be more effective when delivered by a therapist rather than by an impersonal computer program.",-1
"Cardiovascular Characteristics of Zucker Fatty Diabetes Mellitus Rats, an Animal Model for Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes","Zucker fatty diabetes mellitus (ZFDM) rats harboring the missense mutation (fa) in a leptin receptor gene have been recently established as a novel animal model of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we explored changes in cardiovascular dynamics including blood pressure and heart rate (HR) associated with the progression of obesity and T2D, as well as pathological changes in adipose tissue and kidney. There was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in ZFDM-Leprfa/fa (Homo) compared with ZFDM-Leprfa/+ (Hetero) rats, while HR and plasma adrenaline in Homo were significantly lower than Hetero. The mRNA expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in perirenal white adipose tissue (WAT) from Homo was significantly higher than Hetero. Interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) in Homo was degenerated and whitened. The plasma blood urea nitrogen in Homo was significantly higher than Hetero. In summary, we demonstrated for the first time that HR and plasma adrenaline concentration but not SBP in Homo decrease with obesity and T2D. In addition, inflammation occurs in WAT from Homo, while whitening occurs in BAT. Further, renal function is impaired in Homo. In the future, ZFDM rats will be useful for investigating metabolic changes associated with the progression of obesity and T2D.",-1
Ultrasound Assessment of Subcutaneous Abdominal Fat Thickness After Treatments With a High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic Field Device: A Multicenter Study,"Background:                    High-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) technology is intended for muscle toning, firming, and strengthening.              Objective:                    The goal of this study is to quantify the effect of HIFEM treatments on subcutaneous fat.              Materials and methods:                    A total of 33 patients participated in the study. Each subject underwent 4 treatments on the abdomen with the HIFEM device. Ultrasound images were obtained measuring the thickness of the subcutaneous fat from 4 standardized measurement points. Ultrasound images were taken before treatment and at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits. Photographs were captured using both 2D and 3D cameras. Weight measurements were taken, as well as surveys assessing both patient comfort, satisfaction, and adverse events.              Results:                    A significant reduction in the subcutaneous fat thickness across the abdomen was observed, averaging 19.0%/4.47 Â± 3.23 mm (p < .01) at 1 month after treatment and 23.3%/5.78 Â± 4.07 mm 3 months after treatment. At 1 month, the most significant reduction in subcutaneous fat was measured subumbilically (26.6%/6.25 Â± 4.70 mm; p < .01) and epiumbilically (21.6%/5.08 Â± 3.69 mm; p < .01). No discomfort was reported, and 91% of study participants were satisfied with their result.              Conclusion:                    Based on the ultrasonographic and photographic observations, the authors conclude that the application of an HIFEM field is an effective option for the noninvasive treatment of subcutaneous fat.",-1
Leveraging artificial intelligence to predict ERG gene fusion status in prostate cancer,"Background:                    TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement, the most common E26 transformation specific (ETS) gene fusion within prostate cancer, is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease and carries diagnostic annotations for prostate cancer patients clinically. The ERG rearrangement status in prostatic adenocarcinoma currently cannot be reliably identified from histologic features on H&E-stained slides alone and hence requires ancillary studies such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or next generation sequencing (NGS) for identification.              Methods:                    OBJECTIVE: We accordingly sought to develop a deep learning-based algorithm to identify ERG rearrangement status in prostatic adenocarcinoma based on digitized slides of H&E morphology alone.              Design:                    Setting, and Participants: Whole slide images from 392 in-house and TCGA cases were employed and annotated using QuPath. Image patches of 224 Ã 224 pixel were exported at 10 Ã, 20 Ã, and 40 Ã for input into a deep learning model based on MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network architecture pre-trained on ImageNet. A separate model was trained for each magnification. Training and test datasets consisted of 261 cases and 131 cases, respectively. The output of the model included a prediction of ERG-positive (ERG rearranged) or ERG-negative (ERG not rearranged) status for each input patch.              Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:                    Various accuracy measurements including area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the deep learning model.              Results and limitations:                    All models showed similar ROC curves with AUC results ranging between 0.82 and 0.85. The sensitivity and specificity of these models were 75.0% and 83.1% (20 Ã model), respectively.              Conclusions:                    A deep learning-based model can successfully predict ERG rearrangement status in the majority of prostatic adenocarcinomas utilizing only H&E-stained digital slides. Such an artificial intelligence-based model can eliminate the need for using extra tumor tissue to perform ancillary studies in order to assess for ERG gene rearrangement in prostatic adenocarcinoma.",-1
Î±-Synuclein antisense transcript SNCA-AS1 regulates synapses- and aging-related genes suggesting its implication in Parkinson's disease,"SNCA protein product, Î±-synuclein, is widely renowned for its role in synaptogenesis and implication in both aging and Parkinson's disease (PD), but research efforts are still needed to elucidate its physiological functions and mechanisms of regulation. In this work, we aim to characterize SNCA-AS1, antisense transcript to the SNCA gene, and its implications in cellular processes. The overexpression of SNCA-AS1 upregulates both SNCA and Î±-synuclein and, through RNA-sequencing analysis, we investigated the transcriptomic changes of which both genes are responsible. We highlight how they impact neurites' extension and synapses' biology, through specific molecular signatures. We report a reduced expression of markers associated with synaptic plasticity, and we specifically focus on GABAergic and dopaminergic synapses, for their relevance in aging processes and PD, respectively. A reduction in SNCA-AS1 expression leads to the opposite effect. As part of this signature is co-regulated by the two genes, we discriminate between functions elicited by genes specifically altered by SNCA-AS1 or SNCA's overexpression, observing a relevant role for SNCA-AS1 in synaptogenesis through a shared molecular signature with SNCA. We also highlight how numerous deregulated pathways are implicated in aging-related processes, suggesting that SNCA-AS1 could be a key player in cellular senescence, with implications for aging-related diseases. Indeed, the upregulation of SNCA-AS1 leads to alterations in numerous PD-specific genes, with an impact highly comparable to that of SNCA's upregulation. Our results show that SNCA-AS1 elicits its cellular functions through the regulation of SNCA, with a specific modulation of synaptogenesis and senescence, presenting implications in PD.",-1
Interactions of a boron-containing levodopa derivative on D 2 dopamine receptor and its effects in a Parkinson disease model,"Levodopa is a cornerstone in Parkinson's disease treatment. Beneficial effects are mainly by binding on D2 receptors. Docking simulations of a set of compounds including well-known D2-ligands and a pool of Boron-Containing Compounds (BCC), particularly boroxazolidones with a tri/tetra-coordinated boron atom, were performed on the D2 Dopamine receptor (D2DR). Theoretical results yielded higher affinity of the compound DPBX, a Dopaboroxazolidone, than levodopa on D2DR. Essential interactions with residues in the third and sixth transmembrane domains of the D2DR appear to be crucial to induce and stabilize interactions in the active receptor state. Results from a motor performance evaluation of a murine model of Parkinson's disease agree with theoretical results, as DPBX showed similar efficacy to that of levodopa for diminishing MPTP-induced parkinsonism. This beneficial effect was disrupted with prior Risperidone (D2DR antagonist) administration, supporting the role of D2DR in the biological effect of DPBX. In addition, DPBX limited neuronal loss in substantia nigra in a similar manner to that of levodopa administration.",-1
Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea Supplementation Combined with Vaginal Hyaluronic Acid to Boost the Remission of Cervical Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (L-SILs): A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background and Objectives: Echinacea angustifolia and purpurea have known immunomodulatory effects which boost viral clearance, including HPV infection. However, evidence regarding the improvement due to Echinacea-based supplements of cervical HPV-related pathologies is still lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Echinacea supplementation on the remission of cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL). Materials and Methods: A single-blind 1:1:1 parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Colposcopy Unit of a tertiary care referral center. Reproductive-aged women were allocated either to (a) an oral supplement based on Echinacea extracts plus vaginal hyaluronic acid-based soft gel capsules, (b) the Echinacea supplement alone, or (c) vaginal hyaluronic acid-based soft gel capsules alone for 3 months. The primary outcome was the regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1 for each treatment arm at 3, 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included changes in the epithelialization, pap smear, colposcopic parameters, histological reports, and vaginal health indexes (VHI) in the study groups. Results: 153 women (52 for arm A, 50 for arm B and 51 for arm C) completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in both primary and secondary outcomes for the three groups after 3 months. At the 6-month follow-up, the number of persistent CIN-1 diagnoses was significantly lower in arm A (15/51), rather than in arm B (23/48, p = 0.03) and C (27/49, p = 0.03). Similarly, the same effect was seen after 12 months for treatment A (5/51) relative to B (15/48, p = 0.03) and C (14/48, p = 0.03). Colposcopic, histological and vaginal parameters were all significantly improved at 6 and 12 months for arm A relative to B and C, while no beneficial effects were seen after 3 months. Conclusions: Echinacea extracts supplementation in women with L-SIL/CIN-1 significantly boosts HPV lesion clearance, reducing the overall amount of diagnosis, histological, colposcopic and vaginal parameters after 6 and 12 months. However, a limited sample size reduces the quality of evaluated evidence, emphasizing the need for additional studies to validate these findings.",-1
Circulating microRNAs as predictive biomarkers of coronary artery diseases in type 2 diabetes patients,"Background:                    Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an increasing metabolic disorder mostly resulting from unhealthy lifestyles. T2DM patients are prone to develop heart conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD) which is a major cause of death in the world. Most clinical symptoms emerge at the advanced stages of CAD; therefore, establishing new biomarkers detectable in the early stages of the disease is crucial to enhance the efficiency of treatment. Recently, a significant body of evidence has shown alteration in miRNA levels associate with dysregulated gene expression occurring in T2DM and CAD, highlighting significance of circulating miRNAs in early detection of CAD arising from T2DM. Therefore, it seems crucial to establish a link between the miRNAs prognosing value and development of CAD in T2DM.              Aim:                    This study provides an overview on the alterations of the circulatory miRNAs in T2DM and various CADs and consider the potentials of miRNAs as biomarkers prognosing CADs in T2DM patients.              Materials and methods:                    Literature search was conducted for miRNAs involved in development of T2DM and CAD using the following key words: ""miRNAs"", ""Biomarker"", ""Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (T2DM)"", ""coronary artery diseases (CAD)"". Articles written in the English language.              Result:                    There has been shown a rise in miR-375, miR-9, miR-30a-5p, miR-150, miR-9, miR-29a, miR-30d, miR-34a, miR-124a, miR-146a, miR-27a, and miR-320a in T2DM; whereas, miR-126, miR-21, miR-103, miR-28-3p, miR-15a, miR-145, miR-375, miR-223 have been shown to decrease. In addition to T2DM, some miRNAs such as mirR-1, miR-122, miR-132, and miR-133 play a part in development of subclinical aortic atherosclerosis associated with metabolic syndrome. Some miRNAs increase in both T2DM and CAD such as miR-1, miR-132, miR-133, and miR-373-3-p. More interestingly, some of these miRNAs such as miR-92a elevate years before emerging CAD in T2DM.              Conclusion:                    dysregulation of miRNAs plays outstanding roles in development of T2DM and CAD. Also, elevation of some miRNAs such as miR-92a in T2DM patients can efficiently prognose development of CAD in these patients, so these miRNAs can be used as biomarkers in this regard.",-1
Inhibiting miR-182-3p Alleviates Gestational Diabetes Mellitus by Improving Insulin Resistance in Skeletal Muscle,"Background:                    Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common metabolic diseases occurring during pregnancy. MiR-182-3p participates in a variety of physiological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and migration5, but its role in GDM is largely unknown.              Aims:                    To investigate the relationship between miRNA-182-3p and GDM and explore a potential therapeutic strategy for GDM.              Study design:                    Animal experimentation.              Methods:                    To evaluate the effect of miRNA182-3p in GDM, mice were separated as negative control (NC), miRNA-182-3p mimic or miRNA-182-3p inhibitor, and miRNAs were administered intraperitoneally. Additionally, miRNA-182-3p mimic or miRNA-182-3p inhibitor was transfected into C2C12 cells to evaluate glucose metabolism and insulin-related pathways.              Results:                    The miR-182-3p mimic accelerated GDM, which was effectively reversed by the inhibitor in GDM mice (P = 0.005, miR- 182-3p inhibitor vs. mimic). Insulin receptor 1 (INSR1) was predicted to be the direct target gene of miR-182-3p using online tools. In addition, the miR-182-3p mimic inhibited INSR1 expression and insulin-related pathways in vivo and in vitro, which were all reversed by the miRNA82-3p inhibitor. Furthermore, the miR-182-3p mimic impaired glucose uptake and consumption by inhibiting translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) toward the C2C12 cell membrane (P = 0.007 vs. control), while the inhibitor accelerated these processes (P = 0.032 vs. control; P = 0.005, miRNA-182-3p inhibitor vs. mimic).              Conclusion:                    Inhibiting miR-182-3p effectively alleviated the development of GDM through INSR1, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for GDM.",-1
Identification of Potential mRNA Biomarkers in Milk Small Extracellular Vesicles of Enzootic Bovine Leukosis Cattle,"Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is a disease caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV); only a small percentage of BLV-infected cattle develop EBL and present with B-cell lymphosarcoma. There is no vaccine against BLV, treatment for EBL, or method for predicting the possibility of EBL onset, thus making EBL control difficult. Herein, to explore biomarkers for EBL in milk, we examined the mRNA profiles of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in milk from four BLV-uninfected and four EBL cattle by microarray analysis. It was revealed that 14 mRNAs were encapsulated in significantly higher quantities, and these mRNAs were therefore selected as biomarker candidates. Primers for these mRNAs were designed, and nine primer sets were available for quantitative real-time PCR. Nine mRNAs were evaluated for their availability as biomarkers for EBL using sEVs from newly-collected milk of 7 uninfected and 10 EBL cattle. The quantities of eight mRNAs (TMEM156, SRGN, CXCL8, DEFB4A, FABP5, LAPTM5, LGALS1, and VIM) were significantly higher in milk sEVs of EBL cattle than in those of uninfected cattle. Therefore, our findings indicate that these eight mRNAs in milk sEVs can be used as potential EBL biomarkers with combination use, although single mRNA use is not enough. Consequently, cattle at risk of EBL onset can be identified by monitoring the fluctuation in quantities of these mRNAs in milk before they develop EBL.",-1
Monoamine oxidase is a source of oxidative stress in obese patients with chronic inflammation 1,"Obesity is an important preventable risk factor for morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic disease. Oxidative stress (including in visceral adipose tissue) and chronic low-grade inflammation are the major underlying pathomechanisms. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) has recently emerged as an important source of cardiovascular oxidative stress. The present study was conducted to evaluate the role of MAO as contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in white adipose tissue and vessels harvested from patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. To this aim, visceral adipose tissue and mesenteric artery branches were isolated from obese patients with chronic inflammation and used for organ bath, ROS production, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistology studies. The human visceral adipose tissue and mesenteric artery branches contain mainly the MAO-A isoform, as shown by the quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistology experiments. A significant upregulation of MAO-A, the impairment in vascular reactivity, and increase in ROS production were found in obese vs. non-obese patients. Incubation of the adipose tissue samples and vascular rings with the MAO-A inhibitor (clorgyline, 30 min) improved vascular reactivity and decreased ROS generation. In conclusion, MAO-A is the predominant isoform in human abdominal adipose and vascular tissues, is overexpressed in the setting of inflammation, and contributes to the endothelial dysfunction.",-1
Polymorphism in the human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 gene 3'-untranslated region determines polyadenylation signal usage,"Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) encodes a drug-metabolising enzyme that plays a role in chemical-associated cancer risk, cancer cell survival and mitochondrial function. Its expression and protein activity are regulated by transcriptional, translational, and post-translational processes, including microRNAs such as miR-1290. Several studies have shown the presence of multiple polyadenylation sites in the NAT1 gene. However, their role in NAT1 expression is poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the genetic sequence of the NAT1 gene in human cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and breast tumour tissue. We identified five potential polyadenylation signals, two of which carry known single nucleotide polymorphism that affect site usage. Cells that are homozygous for adenine at base 1642, the most distal polyadenylation site, use this site whereas those homozygous for cytosine at base 1642 could not. We also found that the presence of adenine at base 1642 is associated with the NAT1*10 haplotype. Because the putative binding site for miR-1290 is located between the last two polyadenylation sites, we hypothesised that cells that do not use the most distal site will be unaffected by miR-1290. However, this was not the case. NAT1 activity was positively correlated with miR-1290, and induction of miR-1290 in SH-SY5Y cells was associated with induction, not inhibition, of NAT1 activity. The use of PolyA1264 or PolyA1642 did not alter NAT1 activity following ectopic expression of a miR-1290 mimic. These results suggest that the role of miR-1290 in the regulation of NAT1 activity is more complex than previously reported.",-1
Comparison of Cardiovascular Benefits of Bariatric Surgery and Abdominal Lipectomy,"Purpose of review:                    The purpose of this review is to examine recent evidence supporting effectiveness of bariatric surgery and abdominal lipectomy as interventional strategies aimed at reduction in incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related morbidity and mortality in obese and metabolic syndrome patients.              Recent findings:                    While several studies show reduction in CVD risk factors in patients who have undergone both the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy, very few demonstrate actual improvements in cardiovascular function, or a decrease in CVD events or CVD-related mortality. Consequently, the cardiovascular benefits of the less invasive sleeve gastrectomy in comparison to the gastric bypass are also unclear. Striking new data on large patient samples demonstrate significant positive correlation between gastric bypass and CVD risk factor reduction only in patients who are diabetic or > 50 years of age at the time of surgery, with no significant differences in non-diabetic and younger patients and with significant side effects. On the other hand, a markedly less invasive removal of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue via lipectomy consistently and significantly improved CVD risk factors as well as cardiovascular function in the very few studies available. Overall, neither the potential nor the definitive cardiovascular benefits of either of the commonly used bariatric surgical or the various lipectomy procedures have been adequately explored. Future basic science and clinical studies have the opportunity to understand the mechanisms and long-term consequences of both approaches and develop personalized approaches with higher benefit to side effect ratios.",-1
Pharmacotechnical Evaluation by SeDeM Expert System to Develop Orodispersible Tablets,"Sediment delivery model (SeDeM) system is innovative tool to correlate micromeritic properties of powders with compressibility. It involves computation of indices which facilitate direct compressibility of solids and enable corrective measures through particle engineering. Study had multiple objectives, viz, (i) to enhance solubility of BCS class II, nevirapine using solid dispersions; (ii) SeDeM analyses of excipients and solid dispersions to analyze direct compressibility; and (iii) prepare orodispersible tablets (ODT). Solid dispersions were prepared by solvent evaporation. Superdisintegrants and solid dispersions were analyzed for primary indices of dimension, compressibility, flowability, stability, and disgregability derived from micromeritic properties. Radar diagrams were constructed to provide visual clues to deficient properties for direct compressibility. ODTs were prepared using excipients which passed criteria for direct compressibility and evaluated for tablet properties. Solid dispersions with Eudragit S100 revealed 6 to 10 fold increase in solubility in various dissolution media including biorelevant media in comparison with plain drug. Solubility was found to be pH dependent. SeDeM analyses facilitated identification of superdisintegrants and excipients with unfavorable compressibility. Radar diagrams provided a clear pictorial evidence of lacunae in powder properties. Based on SeDeM results, tablets were formulated by direct compression using crosspovidone, croscarmellose sodium, and mannitol. All batches showed 40% release in first minute in simulated salivary fluid.",-1
Diallyl Disulfide (DADS) Ameliorates Intestinal Candida albicans Infection by Modulating the Gut microbiota and Metabolites and Providing Intestinal Protection in Mice,"Diallyl disulfide (DADS), a garlic extract also known as allicin, has been reported to have numerous biological activities, including anticancer, antifungal, and inflammation-inhibiting activities, among others. Although many studies have assessed whether DADS can treat Candida albicans infection in vitro, its in vivo function and the underlying mechanism are still not clear. Accumulated evidence has implicated the gut microbiota as an important factor in the colonization and invasion of C. albicans. Thus, this study aimed to identify the mechanism by which DADS ameliorates dextran sulfate (DSS)-induced intestinal C. albicans infection based on the systematic analysis of the gut microbiota and metabolomics in mice. Here, we determined the body weight, survival, colon length, histological score, and inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum and intestines of experimental mice. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota and metabolite analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and LC-MS metabolomics, respectively. DADS significantly alleviated DSS-induced intestinal C. albicans infection and altered the gut microbial community structure and metabolic profile in the mice. The abundances of some pathogenic bacteria, such as Proteobacteria, Escherichia-Shigella, and Streptococcus, were notably decreased after treatment with DADS. In contrast, SCFA-producing bacteria, namely, Ruminiclostridium, Oscillibacter, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013, greatly increased in number. The perturbance of metabolites in infectious mice was improved by DADS, with increases in secondary bile acids, arachidonic acid, indoles and their derivatives, which were highly related to the multiple differentially altered metabolic pathways, namely, bile secretion, arachidonic acid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism. This study indicated that DADS could modulate gut microbiota and metabolites and protect the gut barrier to alleviate DSS-induced intestinal C. albicans infection in mice. Moreover, this work might also provide novel insight into the treatment of C. albicans infection using DADS.",-1
Visceral Fat Volume From Standard Preoperative CT is an Independent Predictor of Short-term Survival in Patients Undergoing Surgery for Metastatic Spine Disease,"Study design:                    This is a retrospective cohort.              Objective:                    Determine the relationship of body morphometry to postoperative survival in patients with vertebral metastases.              Summary of background data:                    Most operations for vertebral metastases aim for palliation not cure, yet expected patient survival heavily influences treatment plans. We seek to demonstrate that preoperative fat and muscle volumes on standard-of-care computed tomography (CT) are independent predictors of survival after surgery for vertebral metastases.              Materials and methods:                    Included data were preoperative neurological status, adjuvant treatments, CT-assessed body composition, health comorbidities, details of oncologic disease, and Tomita and Tokuhashi scores. Body composition-visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and total muscle area-were assessed on preoperative L3/4 CT slice with Image J software. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine independent predictors of 3-, 6-, and 12-month survival.              Results:                    We included 75 patients (median age, 57, 57.3% male, 66.7% white) with the most common primary lesions being lung (17.3%), prostate (14.7%), colorectal (12.0%), breast (10.7%), and kidney (9.3%). The only independent predictor of 3-month survival was visceral fat area [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.23 per 1000 mm; P=0.02]. Independent predictors of survival at 6 months were body mass index (95% CI: 1.04-1.35 per kg/m; P=0.009), Karnofsky performance status (95% CI: 1.00-1.15; P<0.05), modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (95% CI: 1.11-7.91; P=0.03), and postoperative chemotherapy use (95% CI: 1.13-4.71; P=0.02). Independent predictors of 12-month survival were kidney primary pathology (95% CI: 0.00-0.00; P<0.01), body mass index (95% CI: 1.03-1.39 per kg/m; P=0.02), and being ambulatory preoperatively (95% CI: 1.28-17.06; P=0.02).              Conclusions:                    Visceral fat mass was an independent, positive predictor of short-term postoperative survival in patients treated for vertebral metastases. As a result, we believe that the prognostic accuracy of current predictors may be improved by the addition of visceral fat volume as a risk factor.",-1
Water only fasting and its effect on chemotherapy administration in gynecologic malignancies,"Objective:                    As a protective response, during starvation organisms withdraw energy from growth and reproduction to focus on cellular maintenance. Cancer cells cannot undergo this differential response which has been theorized as an adjunct to improve both the effect of chemotherapy treatment and reduce treatment side effects. We sought to investigate the feasibility and effect of short-term fasting in patients receiving chemotherapy for gynecologic malignancy.              Methods:                    A randomized control trial was conducted of women with gynecologic malignancies receiving at least 6 planned chemotherapy cycles. Fasting patients maintaining a water-only fast for 24 h before and 24 h following each chemotherapy cycle were compared to nonfasting patients. Treatment related side effects and quality of life (QOL) was assessed using NCCN-FACT FOSI-18 questionnaire.              Results:                    Analysis included data from 120 cycles of chemotherapy. The majority of patients had stage 3 and 4 malignancy requiring multi-agent chemotherapy. Eleven patients had ovarian, 8 had uterine, and 1 had cervical cancer. Ninety percent received taxane and platinum-based doublet therapy. Weight loss and unanticipated hospitalizations were similar between treatment groups. Fewer dose reductions or delays were seen in the fasting group. There was no significant difference in mean QOL scores, but fasting group QOL scores improved over the course of treatment to a level that reached the minimal clinically important difference.              Conclusion:                    A 48-h fast is well tolerated without increasing weight loss, hospital admissions, or chemotherapy dose reduction/delays. Fasting resulted in fewer treatment modifications and improved quality of life scores over the course of treatment.",-1
Research on the Mechanism of HMGB1 Regulating Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis by Regulating NF- Îº B,"Background:                    Autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a clinical condition in which memory and cognition is affected badly and is also associated with lower levels of consciousness or even coma in worse scenarios. It is a noninfectious condition which involves immune oriented inflammation.              Objective:                    The study's goal was to figure out what was causing the problem HMGB1 involved in regulating the autoimmune encephalomyelitis by regulating NF-ÎºB.              Materials and methods:                    The expressions of HMGB1, miR-129-5p, and TLR4/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway-related proteins were measured by qRT-PCR. To explore the differences among its control, models, and all groups, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence tests were performed.              Results:                    According to the findings, miR-129-5p is in charge of suppressing HMGB1 production and inhibiting the TLR4/NF-ÎºB signalling pathway. On development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis, neurons in the hippocampus area got injured in the miR-129-5p inhibitors class. In the miR-129-5p inhibitor class, expression of miR-129-5p reduced and HMGB1 elevated, increasing neuronal inflammation and damage. Impairment in the hippocampus, on the either side, was shown to be reduced in HMGB1 shRNA, miR-129-5p mimics, and TLR4/NF-ÎºB classes.              Conclusion:                    According to the study's findings, there is indeed a link among increased miR-129-5p and decreased HMGB1 expression and also suppression of the TLR4/NF-ÎºB signal transduction pathway in autoimmune encephalomyelitis in the miR-129-5p inhibitors group. As a result, we may assume the autoimmune disease illness has progressed once concentrations of HMGB1, TLR4/NF-ÎºB, and miR-129-5p have decreased.",-1
"Dengue Virus Infections among Peace Corps Volunteers in Timor-Leste, 2018-2019","Dengue is an ongoing health risk for Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) working in the tropics. On May 2019, the Peace Corps Office of Health Services notified the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a dengue outbreak among PCVs in Timor-Leste. The purpose of this investigation was to identify the clinical, demographic, and epidemiological characteristics of PCVs with dengue and recommend dengue preventive measures. To identify PCVs with dengue and describe disease severity, the medical records of PCVs reporting fever during September 2018-June 2019 were reviewed. To identify factors associated with dengue virus (DENV) infection, we administered a questionnaire on demographics, travel history, and mosquito avoidance behaviors and collected blood specimens to detect the anti-DENV IgM antibody to diagnose recent infection. Of 35 PCVs in-country, 11 (31%) tested positive for dengue (NS1, IgM, PCR), eight requiring hospitalization and medical evacuation. Among 27 (77%) PCVs who participated in the investigation, all reported having been recently bitten by mosquitoes and 56% reported being bitten most often at home; only 16 (59%) reported having screens on bedroom windows. Nearly all (93%) PCVs reported using a bed net every night; fewer (70%) reported using mosquito repellent at least once a day. No behaviors were significantly associated with DENV infection. Raising awareness of dengue risk among PCVs and continuing to encourage mosquito avoidance behavior to prevent dengue is critical. Access to and use of measures to avoid mosquito bites should be improved or implemented. Peace Corps medical officers should continue to receive an annual refresher training on dengue clinical management.",-1
Synthetic Circular miR-21 Sponge as Tool for Lung Cancer Treatment,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and several miRNAs are associated with it. MiRNA sponges are presented as tools to inhibit miRNAs. We designed a system to capture miRNAs based on circular RNAs (circRNA). To demonstrate its usefulness, we chose miR-21, which is upregulated and implicated in lung cancer. We constructed a miR-21 sponge and inserted it into a vector that facilitates circular RNA production (Circ-21) to study its effect on growth, colony formation, and migration in lung cancer cell lines and multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS). Circ-21 induced a significant and time-dependent decrease in the growth of A549 and LL2 cells, but not in L132 cells. Furthermore, A549 and LL2 cells transfected with Circ-21 showed a lower number of colonies and migration than L132. Similar findings were seen in A549 and LL2 Circ-21 MTS, which showed a significant decrease in volume growth, but not in L132 Circ-21 MTS. Based on this, the miR-21 circular sponge may suppress the processes of tumorigenesis and progression. Therefore, our system based on circular sponges seems to be effective, as a tool for the capture of other miRNAs.",-1
The impact of intestinal microbiota in antithymocyte globulin-based myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation,"Background:                    The correlation between intestinal microbiota and clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has been reported in platforms with T-cell depletion or postcyclophosphamide-based graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens. It is still unclear whether it is the same in platforms of antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-based myeloablative allo-HCT.              Methods:                    A total of 603 fecal specimens from 100 consecutive patients receiving allo-HCT were collected between December 2018 and July 2020. Fetal samples were profiled with next-generation sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes.              Results:                    The diversity decreased to the lowest level at approximately day 12 after allo-HCT and then increased over time. According to the diversity of 314 samples that were collected from 86 patients during the engraftment period, patients were grouped into the low- and high-diversity groups. Two-year overall survival in the high-diversity group was significantly longer than that in the low-diversity group (83.7% vs 60.6%, P = .026). Further analysis revealed that worse outcomes for patients with low diversity were associated with increased risk of worse outcomes for patients with low diversity (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.95; P = .046). Its association with relapse and GVHD was not found. Compositional analysis of fecal microbiota revealed that the abundance of bacteroides decreased greatly during allo-HCT, whereas that of Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Escherichia was found to be increased.              Conclusions:                    This study indicates that gut dysbiosis in platforms of ATG-based myeloablative allo-HCT featured loss of bacterial diversity. The diversity of the intestinal flora at the engraftment period was an independent predictor of longer survival.              Lay summary:                    The correlation between intestinal microbiota and clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is reported in platforms with T-cell depletion or postcyclophosphamide-based graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens. It is still unclear whether it is the same pattern in platforms of antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-based T-cell repletion myeloablative allo-HCT. Our study indicated that gut dysbiosis in platforms of ATG-based myeloablative allo-HCT also features loss of bacterial diversity. The diversity of the intestinal flora at the engraftment period is an independent predictor of longer survival.",-1
The association of physical illness and low-grade inflammatory markers with depressive symptoms in a large NHANES community sample: Dissecting mediating and moderating effects,"Background:                    Both low-grade elevation in peripheral inflammatory markers (e.g., white blood count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)) and physical illness (both chronic and acute) have been associated with depressive symptomology. However, it is unclear if low-grade elevation in inflammatory markers mediates relationships between physical illness and depression or if physical illness positively moderates relationships between inflammatory markers and depression.              Methods:                    In a well-powered, racially diverse cohort (n = 21,525) from NHANES datasets, we examined if inflammatory markers (CRP and WBC) and physical illnesses (acute and chronic) were independently associated with depression severity. We also examined if associations between physical illness and depression severity were mediated by inflammatory markers and if physical illness moderated associations between inflammatory markers and depression.              Results:                    We found that both inflammatory markers and physical illness were associated with depression severity, even after considering a wide range of potential confounders (e.g., age, gender, body mass index). Inflammatory markers mediated a marginal portion (<5%; p < 0.001) of potential effects of physical illness on depression severity. In moderation analyses, associations between inflammatory markers and depression severity were significantly stronger in participants with chronic physical illness than those without. This moderating effect was not present for acute physical illness.              Conclusions:                    Inflammatory markers and physical illness appear independently linked to depression severity and, in individuals with chronic physical illness, inflammatory markers are more tightly connected to depressive symptomology. Such findings could help guide future individualized treatment research for depression based on both inflammatory marker level and physical illness burden.",-1
Insulin resistance may be misdiagnosed by HOMA-IR in adults with greater fat-free mass: the ELSA-Brasil Study,"Aims:                    Conflicting results have been reported on the association of fat-free mass (FFM) and insulin resistance (IR). This study sought to test the association of FFM and IR by indexing FFM to avoid collinearity with fat mass.              Methods:                    This cross-sectional study comprised 11,284 volunteers, aged 38-79 years. Body composition was assessed by multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance. FFM indexed to body surface area (FFMbsa) was calculated. IR and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were estimated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2h-OGTT), respectively.              Results:                    Percent body fat decreased from the 1st to the 5th quintile of FFMbsa in both women (Eta2 = 0.166) and men (Eta2 = 0.133). In women, fasting insulin (Eta2 = 0.002), glucose (Eta2 = 0.006), and HOMA-IR (Eta2 = 0.007) increased slightly, but 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) was similar across the quintiles of FFMbsa. In men, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were similar across the quintiles of FFMbsa, whereas fasting glucose increased slightly (Eta2 = 0.002) and 2-h PG decreased (Eta2 = 0.005) toward the highest quintile of FFMbsa. The higher the odds ratio for IR, the greater the FFMbsa in both sexes. Differently, FFMbsa did not affect the odds of IGT in women, while in men the odds ratio for IGT was lower in the 5th quintile compared with the 1st quintile of FFMbsa.              Conclusions:                    Higher odds of IR associated with greater FFMbsa contrasted with lower odds of IGT associated with greater FFMbsa. IR may be misdiagnosed by HOMA-IR in adults with greater fat-free mass.",-1
Approaches to screening for hyperglycaemia in pregnant women during and after the COVID-19 pandemic,"Aim:                    To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of alternative diagnostic strategies to oral glucose tolerance tests, including random plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c , during the COVID-19 pandemic.              Methods:                    Retrospective service data (Cambridge, UK; 17 736 consecutive singleton pregnancies, 2004-2008; 826 consecutive gestational diabetes pregnancies, 2014-2019) and 361 women with â? gestational diabetes risk factor (OPHELIA prospective observational study, UK) were included. Pregnancy outcomes included gestational diabetes (National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence or International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria), diabetes in pregnancy (WHO criteria), Caesarean section, large-for-gestational age infant, neonatal hypoglycaemia and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Receiver-operating characteristic curves and unadjusted logistic regression were used to compare random plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c performance.              Results:                    Gestational diabetes diagnosis was significantly associated with random plasma glucose at 12 weeks [area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for both criteria 0.81 (95% CI 0.79-0.83)], fasting plasma glucose [National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.85); International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.98)] and HbA1c at 28 weeks' gestation [National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence: 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90); International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups: 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.91)]. Each measure predicts some, but not all, pregnancy outcomes studied. At 12 weeks, ~5% of women would be identified using random plasma glucose â?.5 mmol/l (sensitivity 42%; specificity 96%) and at 28 weeks using HbA1c â?9 mmol/mol (sensitivity 26%; specificity 96%) or fasting plasma glucose â?.2-5.4 mmol/l (sensitivity 18-41%; specificity 97-98%).              Conclusions:                    Random plasma glucose at 12 weeks, and fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c at 28 weeks identify women with hyperglycaemia at risk of suboptimal pregnancy outcomes. These opportunistic laboratory tests perform adequately for risk stratification when oral glucose tolerance testing is not available.",-1
microRNA-126 inhibits vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin-1beta in human dental pulp cells,"Background:                    Vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) mediates pulpitis via regulating interleukin (IL)-1Î². microRNA (miR)-126 was reported to regulate the VCAM-1 under many different pathophysiological circumstances. We investigated variations of miR-126 and VCAM-1 in inflamed patient pulp tissues and determined potential roles of miR-126 in pulpitis using human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) in vitro.              Methods:                    We quantitatively measured the transcripts of miR-126 and VCAM-1 in inflamed human pulp tissues using qRT-PCR and compared with those from healthy human pulp tissues. In addition, we transfected miR-126 in hDPCs using plasmid DNA (pDNA)-encoding miR-126 delivered by polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles.              Results:                    The irreversible pulpitis significantly reduced miR-126 and increased the transcript of VCAM-1 in pulp tissues (p < 0.05). pDNA-encoding miR-126 delivered PEI nanoparticles and effectively upregulated the expression of miR-126 in hDPCs (p < 0.05). The overexpression of miR-126 could effectively suppress the transcripts and protein levels of VCAM-1 and IL-1Î² induced by Pg-LPS at 100ng/mL in DPCs (p < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    miR-126 is involved in pulpitis and downregulated the VCAM-1 and IL-1Î² in DPCs. miR-126 may be a potential target to attenuate the inflammation of pulpitis.",-1
Towards more efficient ophthalmic disease classification and lesion location via convolution transformer,"Objective:                    A retina optical coherence tomography (OCT) image differs from a traditional image due to its significant speckle noise, irregularity, and inconspicuous features. A conventional deep learning architecture cannot effectively improve the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of OCT images, and noisy images are not conducive to further diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel lesion-localization convolution transformer (LLCT) method, which combines both convolution and self-attention to classify ophthalmic diseases more accurately and localize the lesions in retina OCT images.              Methods:                    A novel architecture design is accomplished through applying customized feature maps generated by convolutional neutral network (CNN) as the input sequence of self-attention network. This design takes advantages of CNN's extracting image features and transformer's consideration of global context and dynamic attention. Part of the model is backward propagated to calculate the gradient as a weight parameter, which is multiplied and summed with the global features generated by the forward propagation process to locate the lesion.              Results:                    Extensive experiments show that our proposed design achieves improvement of about 7.6% in overall accuracy, 10.9% in overall sensitivity, and 9.2% in overall specificity compared with previous methods. And the lesions can be localized without the labeling data of lesion location in OCT images.              Conclusion:                    The results prove that our method significantly improves the performance and reduces the computation complexity in artificial intelligence assisted analysis of ophthalmic disease through OCT images.              Significance:                    Our method has a significance boost in ophthalmic disease classification and location via convolution transformer. This is applicable to assist ophthalmologists greatly.1.",-1
Influence of radial optic flow stimulation on static postural balance in Parkinson's disease: A preliminary study,"The role of optic flow in the control of balance in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) has yet to be studied. Since basal ganglia are understood to have a role in controlling ocular fixation, we have hypothesized that persons with PD would exhibit impaired performance in fixation tasks, i.e., altered postural balance due to the possible relationships between postural disorders and visual perception. The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate how people affected by PD respond to optic flow stimuli presented with radial expanding motion, with the intention to see how the stimulation of different retinal portions may alter the static postural sway. We measured the body sway using center of pressure parameters recorded from two force platforms during the presentation of the foveal, peripheral and full field radial optic flow stimuli. Persons with PD had different visual responses in terms of fixational eye movement characteristics, with greater postural alteration in the sway area and in the medio-lateral direction than the age-matched control group. Balance impairment in the medio-lateral oscillation is often observed in persons with atypical Parkinsonism, but not in Parkinson's disease. Persons with PD are more dependent on visual feedback with respect to age-matched control subjects, and this could be due to their impaired peripheral kinesthetic feedback. Visual stimulation of standing posture would provide reliable signs in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonism.",-1
MiR-1-3p targets CENPF to repress tumor-relevant functions of gastric cancer cells,"Here we noted significantly downregulated miR-1-3p in gastric cancer (GC) tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue through qRT-PCR. Lowly expressed miR-1-3p correlated GC progression. Overexpressing miR-1-3p could restrain tumor-relevant cell behaviors in GC, while miR-1-3p inhibitor treatment triggered the opposite results. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter gene detection identified specific binding sites of miR-1-3p in CENPF 3'untranslated region. Upregulating miR-1-3p constrained cell progression of GC via CENPF downregulation. Western blot, qRT-PCR and dual-luciferase detections manifested that miR-1-3p negatively mediated CENPF expression in GC cells. Thus, we demonstrated that miR-1-3p negatively mediated CENPF to hamper GC progression. CENPF may be an underlying target for GC therapy.",-1
LncRNA JHDM1D-AS1 Suppresses MPP + -Induced Neuronal Injury in Parkinson's Disease via miR-134-5p/PIK3R3 Axis,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-factorial neurodegenerative disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been revealed to be involved in the process of PD. Herein, this study aimed to investigate the potential function and mechanism of JHDM1D-AS1 (JHDM1D antisense 1) in PD process. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP +)-induced SK-N-SH cells were used to conduct expression and function analyses. Levels of genes and proteins were examined using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot, respectively. ELISA analysis was performed for the detection of interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±. The contents of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using commercial kits. The direct interactions between miR-134-5p and PIK3R3 (Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 3) or JHDM1D-AS1 were verified by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. JHDM1D-AS1 expression was decreased by MPP + in SK-N-SH cells in a dose- or time-dependent manner. Functionally, JHDM1D-AS1 overexpression attenuated MPP + -evoked neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, JHDM1D-AS1 competitively bound to miR-134-5p to upregulate the expression of its target PIK3R3. Rescue experiments suggested that miR-134-5p upregulation reversed the inhibitory effects of JHDM1D-AS1 on MPP + -induced neuronal injury. Moreover, inhibition of miR-134-5p protected neurons against MPP + -induced neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which were abolished by PIK3R3 silencing. JHDM1D-AS1 protected against MPP + -induced neuron injury via miR-134-5p/PIK3R3 axis, suggesting the potential involvement of this axis in PD process.",-1
Emerging Insights Into the Role of Epigenetics and Gut Microbiome in the Pathogenesis of Graves' Ophthalmopathy,"Graves' Ophthalmopathy (GO) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease that is often characterized by infiltration of orbital tissues and is considered as the most common extra-thyroid manifestation of Graves' disease (GD). Although genetic susceptibility has been found to be critical for the phenotype of GO, the associated risk alleles in a single gene are generally insufficient to cause the disease. Accruing evidence has shown that epigenetic disorders can act as the potentially missing link between genetic risk and clinically significant disease development. Abnormal epigenetic modifications can lead to pro-inflammatory cascades and activation of orbital fibroblasts (OFs) by promoting the various inflammatory response pathways and regulating the diverse signaling molecules that are involved in the fibrogenesis and adipogenesis, thereby leading to the significant expansion of orbital tissues, fibrosis and inflammation infiltration. Additionally, emerging evidence has shown that the gut microbiome can possibly drive the pathogenesis of GO by influencing the secretion of Thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) and T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T cells (Treg) imbalance. This paper describes the latest epigenetic research evidence and progress made in comprehending the mechanisms of GO development, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, non-coding RNAs, and the gut microbiome.",-1
Cancer Cells Haploinsufficient for ATM Are Sensitized to PARP Inhibitors by MET Inhibition,"The MET oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase (TK) receptor. Its activation protects cells from death but also stimulates DNA damage response by triggering excess replicative stress. Transcriptomic classification of cancer cell lines based on MET expression showed that response to the PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib is poorer in MET overexpressing cell lines. Accordingly, a high MET expressing lung carcinoma cell line was sensitized to PARPi by MET TK inhibition. This was not linked solely to MET overexpression: other MET overexpressing cell lines were biochemically but not functionally responsive to combined inhibition. Moreover, exogenously induced MET overexpression was unable to induce resistance to PARPi. The MET overexpressing cell line, responsive to the combined PARP and MET inhibition, carried a heterozygous mutation of the ATM gene and showed an attenuated response of ATM to PARPi. Among the downstream targets of ATM activation, NuMA was phosphorylated only in response to the combined PARP and MET inhibition. Given the role played by NuMA in mitosis, data show that the latter is affected by MET and PARP inhibition in cells with haploinsufficient ATM. This is important as ATM heterozygous mutation is frequently found in human cancer and in lung carcinomas in particular.",-1
Brain Neuroimaging of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review,"Background:                    REM-sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia and a common comorbidity in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is evidence that the presence of RBD is associated with more severe PD. The differences in the clinical manifestations and the natural history are likely to imply underlying differences in the pathophysiology among PD patients with and without RBD. The increasing number of neuroimaging studies support this notion.              Objective:                    Our primary objective was to review the current evidence regarding the brain neuroimaging findings in PD patients with RBD (PDRBD).              Methods:                    A systematic review of articles, published in PubMed between January 1, 2000 and September 23, 2020 was performed. We evaluate previous studies that assessed PD patients with RBD using various brain structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and brain nuclear medicine imaging.              Results:                    Twenty-nine studies, involving a total of 3,347 PD subjects among which 912 subjects with PDRBD, met the selection criteria and were included. The presence of RBD in PD patients is associated with structural and functional alterations in several brain regions, mainly in brainstem, limbic structures, frontotemporal cortex, and basal ganglia, raising the hypothesis of a PDRBD neuroimaging phenotype.              Conclusion:                    The current review provides up-to-date knowledge in this field and summarizes the neurobiological/neuroimaging substrate of RBD in PD.",-1
'I think' (the thoughts of others). The German tradition of apperceptionism and the intellectual history of schizophrenia,"Although contemporary approaches to schizophrenia pinpoint 'disturbances of the self' as a central aetiological factor, historical insight into the link between accounts of schizophrenia and theories of subjectivity and self-consciousness is poor. This paper aims to overcome this gap by providing the outlines of a largely forgotten but crucial part of the intellectual history of schizophrenia. In particular, the impact of the German tradition of apperceptionism on nineteenth-century accounts of schizophrenia is unearthed. This tradition emerged from German Idealism, and culminated in Emil Kraepelin's account of dementia praecox. In addition to filling an important gap in the historiography of psychiatry, this analysis contributes to ongoing efforts to correct some common misunderstandings regarding Kraepelin's theoretical position.",-1
Comparative proteomics reveals mechanisms that underlie insecticide resistance in Culex pipiens pallens Coquillett,"Mosquito control based on chemical insecticides is considered as an important element of the current global strategies for the control of mosquito-borne diseases. Unfortunately, the development of insecticide resistance of important vector mosquito species jeopardizes the effectiveness of insecticide-based mosquito control. In contrast to target site resistance, other mechanisms are far from being fully understood. Global protein profiles among cypermethrin-resistant, propoxur-resistant, dimethyl-dichloro-vinyl-phosphate-resistant and susceptible strain of Culex pipiens pallens were obtained and proteomic differences were evaluated by using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification labeling coupled with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric analysis. A susceptible strain of Culex pipiens pallens showed elevated resistance levels after 25 generations of insecticide selection, through iTRAQ data analysis detected 2,502 proteins, of which 1,513 were differentially expressed in insecticide-selected strains compared to the susceptible strain. Finally, midgut differential protein expression profiles were analyzed, and 62 proteins were selected for verification of differential expression using iTRAQ and parallel reaction monitoring strategy, respectively. iTRAQ profiles of adaptation selection to three insecticide strains combined with midgut profiles revealed that multiple insecticide resistance mechanisms operate simultaneously in resistant insects of Culex pipiens pallens. Significant molecular resources were developed for Culex pipiens pallens, potential candidates were involved in metabolic resistance and reducing penetration or sequestering insecticide. Future research that is targeted towards RNA interference of the identified metabolic targets, such as cuticular proteins, cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases and ribosomal proteins proteins and biological pathways (drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome) could lay the foundation for a better understanding of the genetic basis of insecticide resistance in Culex pipiens pallens.",-1
Resolvins' Obesity-Driven Deficiency: The Implications for Maternal-Fetal Health,"Since pregnancy is already characterized by mild but significant inflammatory activity in physiological conditions, when complicated by obesity the probability of a persistent inflammatory state increases, with consequent multiple repercussions that add up to the complications associated with acute inflammation. In this context, the role of resolvins, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), deriving from omega-3 essential fatty acids, may be crucial. Indeed, differential production in numerous high-risk conditions associated with both childbirth and neonatal health, the correlation between maternal omega-3 intake and resolvin concentrations in maternal blood and at the placental level, and the high values found in breast milk in the first month of breastfeeding, are some of the most important hallmarks of these autacoids. In addition, a growing body of scientific evidence supports the lack of SPMs, at the level of immune-metabolic tissues, in the case of obesity. Furthermore, the obesity-related lack of SPMs seems to be decisive in the context of the current outbreak of COVID-19, as it appears to be one of the causes associated with the higher incidence of complications and negative outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The usefulness of metabolomics in this field appears clear, given that through the metabolome it is possible to observe the numerous and complex interactions between the mother, the placenta and the fetus in order to identify specific biomarkers useful in the prediction, diagnosis and monitoring of the various obstetric conditions. However, further investigations are needed in order to evaluate the possible use of some resolvins as biomarkers of maternal-fetal outcomes but also to establish adequate integration values in pregnant women with omega-3 fatty acids or with more active derivatives that guarantee optimal SPM production under risky conditions.",-1
MicroRNA-17-92a-1 Host Gene (MIR17HG) Expression Signature and rs4284505 Variant Association with Alopecia Areata: A Case-Control Study,"Accumulating evidence indicates the implication of microRNAs (miRs) in cutaneous and hair follicle immunobiology. We evaluated, for the first time, the miR-17-92a-1 cluster host gene (MIR17HG) expression in peripheral blood of 248 unrelated alopecia areata (AA) patients compared to 244 matched controls using Real-Time qPCR. We also tested its association with different rs4284505A&gt;G genotypes (based on TaqMan allelic discrimination PCR) and the available clinical data. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each genetic association model. The upregulation of miR-17 was observed in the serum of patients with alopecia compared to controls (p-value = 0.004). The ROC curve showed high diagnostic performance of miR-17 in differentiating between patients and controls (AUC = 0.85, p-value &lt; 0.001). rs4284505*A/G heterozygotes were more susceptible to the disease (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.01-2.45) under the over-dominant model. Interestingly, patients with the rs4284505*G/G genotype had a higher level of miR-17 than those with the A/A and A/G genotypes. The G/G genotype was associated with the severe phenotype (p-value = 0.038). A/G carriers were the youngest (p-value &lt; 0.001), had more frequent scalp infection (p-value = 0.006), exhibited the worst dermatology life quality index score (p-value = 0.037), and responded less to treatment (p-value = 0.033). In conclusion, MIR17HG expression and the rs4284505 variant were significantly associated with AA and could play a role in pathogenesis and phenotype in the Egyptian population. Further multi-center studies in other ethnicities are warranted to replicate the findings.",-1
Plasma proteome profiling using tandem mass tag labeling technology reveals potential biomarkers for Parkinson's disease: a preliminary study,"Purpose:                    Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequently occurring progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Biomarkers are useful indicators for tracking disease progression, early diagnosis, and intervention of disease progression. We aimed to develop plasma biomarker panel which maybe aid to predict the onset and progression of PD.              Experimental design:                    Tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry was applied using an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer to analyze plasma protein expression in patients diagnosed with PD and healthy controls.              Results:                    In total, 555 proteins were quantified. Using a cut-off of p < 0.05 and a fold change of >1.2 for the variation in expression, 25 proteins were differentially expressed between the PD and control groups. Sixteen proteins were upregulated and nine were downregulated. Several proteins, including Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) and thymosin beta-4 (TMSB4X) were implicated in PD pathogenesis.              Conclusions:                    The data from the TMT-based proteomic profiling of plasma samples in PD may help advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PD and identify potential novel biomarkers of PD for further characterization.",-1
Clinical Role of Serum miR107 in Type 2 Diabetes and Related Risk Factors,"Background:                    As the diagnostic and treatment options for diabetes improve, more attention nowadays is being paid to the exact identification of the etiopathological mechanism of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Insulin resistance (IR) is a pathogenetic background for T2DM. Several studies demonstrate that miRNAs play an important role in systemic inflammation and thus in T2DM pathogenesis. Overexpression of miR-107 may cause an imbalance of glucose homeostasis, obesity, and dyslipidemia, by regulating insulin sensitivity through the insulin signaling pathway.              Methods:                    53 patients with T2DM and 54 nondiabetic patients were involved in the study. This study aimed to examine whether miR-107 expression in the serum of patients with diabetes was different from the control group (non-diabetic) and whether miR-107 expression correlated with lipid levels, BMI, and other factors, and finally, with insulin resistance in general.              Results:                    miR-107 expression was higher in the T2DM group than in the control group (1.33 versus 0.63 (p = 0.016). In general, miR-107 expression was directly and positively associated with BMI (r = 0.3, p = 0.01), age (r = 0.3, p = 0.004), and male gender (p = 0.006). Moreover, miR-107 was related to dyslipidemia: Patients with higher miR-107 levels had lower HDL levels (in the control group: r = -0.262, p = 0.022 vs. diabetic group: r = -0.315, p = 0.007). Finally, the overexpression of miR-107 was associated with higher HOMA-IR in the diabetic group (r = 0.373, p = 0.035).              Conclusion:                    MiR-107 expression is higher among diabetic patients than that of nondiabetic control subjects. Higher miR-107 levels are also related to dyslipidemia (lower HDL levels)-in the general cohort and non-diabetic subjects. Moreover, higher miR-107 expression is related to insulin resistance in the diabetic group. In general, higher miR-107 expression levels are related to a higher BMI, older age, and the male gender.",-1
Baihe Dihuang (Lilium Henryi Baker and Rehmannia Glutinosa) decoction attenuates somatostatin interneurons deficits in prefrontal cortex of depression via miRNA-144-3p mediated GABA synthesis and release,"Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Baihe Dihuang Decoction is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine prescription (Also known as Lilium Henryi Baker and Rehmannia Glutinosa Decoction, LBRD) composed of Lilium Henryi Baker bulb and raw juice from Rehmannia Glutinosa (Gaertn) DC with the curative efficacy of nourishing yin and clearing heat based on the Chinese herbal medicine theory. It has been used as routine medication in treating depression combined with conventional western medicine in China for years.              Aim of the study:                    LBRD can attenuates GABAergic deficits in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of depression. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of antidepressive properties of LBRD in the prefrontal GABAergic interneuron subtypes, including parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-positive neuron.              Materials and methods:                    In this project, chronic unpredicted mild stress paradigm was adopted to construct depression model. After treated with LBRD standard decoction and behaviors test, the level of GABA associated miRNA/mRNA and GABAergic subtype-specific markers were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The lncRNAs/miRNAs/GABA regulatory axis was verified by luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down assay, and theses changes were measured in LBRD administration with the use of immunofluorescence staining and RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization.              Results:                    In the current study, we found that LBRD exhibited high efficacy based on the results of behavioral tests. Meanwhile, LBRD also improved the reduced GABA levels in depression by increasing the expression of lncRNA Neat1 and Malat1, as well as decreasing miRNA-144-3p and miRNA-15b-5p. Moreover, the level of Sst mRNA and protein that were harvested from the mPFC tissues of depression group was significantly lower than those in the control mice. While, these changes can be reverted by LBRD standard decoction administration. Whereas, neither chronic stress nor treatment can change the level of PV and VIP mRNAs and protein expression. In the SST-positive neuron of mPFC tissues, treatment with LBRD standard decoction resulted in the elevation of Gad-67, VGAT, GAT-3 and a reduction of miRNA-144-3p expression.              Conclusions:                    These findings suggested that LBRD antidepressant activities may be related to ameliorating the SST-positive neuron deficits via regulating the miRNA-144-3p mediated GABA synthesis and release.",-1
SemClinBr - a multi-institutional and multi-specialty semantically annotated corpus for Portuguese clinical NLP tasks,"Background:                    The high volume of research focusing on extracting patient information from electronic health records (EHRs) has led to an increase in the demand for annotated corpora, which are a precious resource for both the development and evaluation of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. The absence of a multipurpose clinical corpus outside the scope of the English language, especially in Brazilian Portuguese, is glaring and severely impacts scientific progress in the biomedical NLP field.              Methods:                    In this study, a semantically annotated corpus was developed using clinical text from multiple medical specialties, document types, and institutions. In addition, we present, (1) a survey listing common aspects, differences, and lessons learned from previous research, (2) a fine-grained annotation schema that can be replicated to guide other annotation initiatives, (3) a web-based annotation tool focusing on an annotation suggestion feature, and (4) both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the annotations.              Results:                    This study resulted in SemClinBr, a corpus that has 1000 clinical notes, labeled with 65,117 entities and 11,263 relations. In addition, both negation cues and medical abbreviation dictionaries were generated from the annotations. The average annotator agreement score varied from 0.71 (applying strict match) to 0.92 (considering a relaxed match) while accepting partial overlaps and hierarchically related semantic types. The extrinsic evaluation, when applying the corpus to two downstream NLP tasks, demonstrated the reliability and usefulness of annotations, with the systems achieving results that were consistent with the agreement scores.              Conclusion:                    The SemClinBr corpus and other resources produced in this work can support clinical NLP studies, providing a common development and evaluation resource for the research community, boosting the utilization of EHRs in both clinical practice and biomedical research. To the best of our knowledge, SemClinBr is the first available Portuguese clinical corpus.",-1
Point Tracking Technology of Sports Image Sequence Marks Based on Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm,"Fuzzy clustering algorithms have received widespread attention in various fields. Point tracking technology has significant application importance in sports image data analysis. In order to solve the problem of limited tracking performance caused by the fuzzy and rough division of moving image edges, this paper proposes a point tracking technology based on a fuzzy clustering algorithm, which is used for the point tracking of moving image sequence signs. This article analyzes the development status of sports image sequence analysis and processing technology and introduces some basic theories about fuzzy clustering algorithms. On the basis of the fuzzy clustering algorithm, the positioning and tracking of the marker points of the moving image sequence are studied. A series of experiments have proved that the fuzzy clustering algorithm can improve the recognition rate of the landmark points of the moving image. For the detection and tracking of moving targets, the fuzzy clustering algorithm can reach the limit faster under the same number of iterations, and the image noise can be reduced to 60% of the original by 5 iterations. This has excellent development value in application.",-1
The Impact of OMEGA-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation on Insulin Resistance and Content of Adipocytokines and Biologically Active Lipids in Adipose Tissue of High-Fat Diet Fed Rats,"It has been established that OMEGA-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may improve lipid and glucose homeostasis and prevent the ""low-grade"" state of inflammation in animals. Little is known about the effect of PUFAs on adipocytokines expression and biologically active lipids accumulation under the influence of high-fat diet-induced obesity. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of fish oil supplementation on adipocytokines expression and ceramide (Cer) and diacylglycerols (DAG) content in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of high-fat fed animals. The experiments were carried out on Wistar rats divided into three groups: standard diet-control (SD), high-fat diet (HFD), and high-fat diet + fish oil (HFD+FO). The fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were examined. Expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) protein was determined using the Western blot method. Plasma adipocytokines concentration was measured using ELISA kits and mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR reaction. Cer, DAG, and acyl-carnitine (A-CAR) content was analyzed by UHPLC/MS/MS. The fish oil supplementation significantly decreased plasma insulin concentration and Homeostatic Model Assesment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index and reduced content of adipose tissue biologically active lipids in comparison with HFD-fed subjects. The expression of CPT1 protein in HFD+FO in both adipose tissues was elevated, whereas the content of A-CAR was lower in both HFD groups. There was an increase of adiponectin concentration and expression in HFD+FO as compared to HFD group. OMEGA-3 fatty acids supplementation improved insulin sensitivity and decreased content of Cer and DAG in both fat depots. Our results also demonstrate that PUFAs may prevent the development of insulin resistance in response to high-fat feeding and may regulate the expression and secretion of adipocytokines in this animal model.",-1
E-CatBoost: An efficient machine learning framework for predicting ICU mortality using the eICU Collaborative Research Database,"Improving the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management network and building cost-effective and well-managed healthcare systems are high priorities for healthcare units. Creating accurate and explainable mortality prediction models helps identify the most critical risk factors in the patients' survival/death status and early detect the most in-need patients. This study proposes a highly accurate and efficient machine learning model for predicting ICU mortality status upon discharge using the information available during the first 24 hours of admission. The most important features in mortality prediction are identified, and the effects of changing each feature on the prediction are studied. We used supervised machine learning models and illness severity scoring systems to benchmark the mortality prediction. We also implemented a combination of SHAP, LIME, partial dependence, and individual conditional expectation plots to explain the predictions made by the best-performing model (CatBoost). We proposed E-CatBoost, an optimized and efficient patient mortality prediction model, which can accurately predict the patients' discharge status using only ten input features. We used eICU-CRD v2.0 to train and validate the models; the dataset contains information on over 200,000 ICU admissions. The patients were divided into twelve disease groups, and models were fitted and tuned for each group. The models' predictive performance was evaluated using the area under a receiver operating curve (AUROC). The AUROC scores were 0.86 [std:0.02] to 0.92 [std:0.02] for CatBoost and 0.83 [std:0.02] to 0.91 [std:0.03] for E-CatBoost models across the defined disease groups; if measured over the entire patient population, their AUROC scores were 7 to 18 and 2 to 12 percent higher than the baseline models, respectively. Based on SHAP explanations, we found age, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urine nitrogen, and creatinine level as the most critical cross-disease features in mortality predictions.",-1
Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing revealed the roles of chitin-related genes in the eyestalk abnormality of a novel mud crab hybrid (Scylla serrata â Ã S. paramamosain â?,"Chitin is a kind of insoluble structural polysaccharide and plays different roles in different species. In crustaceans, it forms the structural components in the exoskeleton. In our previous studies, novel mud crab hybrids have been produced from the interspecific hybridization of Scylla serrata â Ã S. paramamosain â? Some of the hybrid crabs have been found to be morphologically (eyestalk) abnormal, but the genetic mechanism remains unknown. To address this question, we performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing on the control group (normal hybrids), abnormal hybrids, and S. paramamosain to uncover the genetic basis underlying this morphological abnormality. A total of 695 mRNAs, 10 miRNAs, 44 circRNAs, and 1957 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between normal and abnormal hybrids. Several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with chitin and cuticle metabolism were identified, including chitin synthase, chitinase, chitin deacetylase, Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase, Î²-1,4-endoglucanase, N-alpha-acetyltransferase, cuticle proprotein, early cuticle protein, and arthrodial cuticle protein. Functional analysis showed that DE miRNAs, DE circRNAs, DE lncRNAs, and lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were enriched in pathways related to the amino acid, carbohydrate, and glycogen metabolism. Considering the importance of the chitin and cuticle in exoskeleton formation, it can be concluded that the changes in the chitin and cuticle biosynthesis might have caused the eyestalk abnormality in hybrid crabs. These findings can lay the solid foundation for a better understanding of the important roles of chitin and cuticle related genes and the development of hybridization techniques in crustaceans.",-1
The MC4R genetic variants are associated with lower visceral fat accumulation and higher postprandial relative increase in carbohydrate utilization in humans,"Purpose:                    The interactions between lifestyle and genetic factors play an important role in obesity development. Mutations in melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R) gene are one of the most common cause of monogenic obesity, however, the functional effects of polymorphic variants near MC4R gene in general populations remain uncertain. The aim of our study was to analyze whether the common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MC4R gene influence the food preferences, physical activity, body fat content and distribution, as well as fasting and postprandial energy expenditure and substrates utilization.              Methods:                    We genotyped previously identified MC4R SNPs: rs17782313, rs633265, rs1350341, rs12970134 in 927 subjects, who underwent anthropometric, total body fat content, visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) measurements, and daily physical activity and dietary intake analysis. In randomly selected 47 subjects the energy expenditure, carbohydrate and lipid utilizations were evaluated in fasting state and after high-carbohydrate and control meals intake.              Results:                    We found the significant associations between studied SNPs of MC4R gene and VAT and VAT/SAT ratio. Moreover, the GG genotype carriers of rs1350341, who had the lowest VAT accumulation (p = 0.012), presented higher relative increase in postprandial carbohydrate utilization (p = 0.013, p = 0.024).              Conclusions:                    We have observed that common SNPs of the MC4R gene influence the body fat content and distribution, as well as relative increase in postprandial carbohydrate utilization. We believe that our study may help to understand better the impact of MC4R gene on obesity development, and to help to provide personalized prevention/treatment strategies to fight against obesity and its metabolic consequences.",-1
Gastroduodenal intussusception caused by gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor in adults: a case report and literature review,"Intussusception mostly occurs in childhood and is rare in adults. Although intussusception can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract, gastroduodenal intussusception caused by a gastric tumor is relatively uncommon in clinical practice. A PubMed search identified 24 published cases of gastroduodenal intussusception caused by gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); however, it is possible that we missed other cases not included in PubMed. Here we report a case of gastroduodenal intussusception caused by gastric GIST in an 85-year-old man. He came to the hospital because of recurrent black stools. Plain computed tomography (CT) scan indicated a mass in the gastric antrum, with slight enhancement in the arterial phase on enhanced CT scan. He was diagnosed with GIST. In addition, images indicated that the mass overlapped into the duodenum, and gastroduodenal intussusception was thus considered. Gastroscopy showed a huge mass in the gastric body. According to the gastroscopy and CT results, gastroduodenal intussusception caused by a gastric tumor was considered. The patient underwent complete surgical removal, which revealed a mass originating from the gastric antrum and overlapping into the duodenum. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was intermediate-risk gastric GIST. The patient was followed up for 4 months without tumor recurrence.",-1
Partial Substitution of Glucose with Xylitol Prolongs Survival and Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Glycolysis of Mice Bearing Orthotopic Xenograft of Oral Cancer,"Many types of cancer have metabolic alterations with increased glycolysis. Identification of alternative sweeteners that do not fuel cancer is a novel approach to cancer control. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of xylitol on tumor growth and survival of mice bearing orthotopic xenograft of tongue cancers. The results showed that partial substitution of glucose with xylitol (glucose 0.35 g plus xylitol 2.06 g/kg body weight) non-significantly reduced tumor volume, and significantly prolonged the median survival time from 19 days in the control to 30.5 days in the xylitol group. Immunohistochemical data of the tongue tissue shows significantly lower intense-to-mild staining ratios of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in the xylitol than those of the control group (p = 0.04). Furthermore, the xylitol substitution significantly reduced the expression of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) (p = 0.03), and showed a non-significant inhibition of PFK activity. In summary, partial substitution of glucose with xylitol at the equivalent dose to human household use of 10 g/day slows down tumor proliferation and prolongs survival of mice bearing an orthotopic oral cancer xenograft, possibly through glycolytic inhibition, with minimal adverse events. The insight warrants clinical studies to confirm xylitol as a candidate sweetener in food products for cancer survivors.",-1
Association Between Breastmilk Microbiota and Food Allergy in Infants,"Regulating the composition of human breastmilk has the potential to prevent allergic diseases early in life. The composition of breastmilk is complex, comprising varying levels of oligosaccharides, immunoactive molecules, vitamins, metabolites, and microbes. Although several studies have examined the relationship between different components of breastmilk and infant food allergies, few have investigated the relationship between microorganisms in breastmilk and infant food allergy. In the present study, we selected 135 healthy pregnant women and their full-term newborns from a cohort of 202 mother-infant pairs. Among them, 69 infants were exclusively breastfed until 6 mo after birth. At follow-up, 11 of the 69 infants developed a food allergy in infancy while 22 showed no signs of allergy. Thirty-three breastmilk samples were collected within 1 mo after delivery, and 123 infant fecal samples were collected at five time points following their birth. These samples were analyzed using microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The abundance and evenness of the milk microbiota and the number of differential bacteria were higher in the breastmilk samples from the non-allergy group than in those from the food allergy group. The non-allergy group showed relatively high abundance of Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Clostridium IV, Clostridium XIVa, Veillonella, and butyrate-producing bacteria such as Fusobacterium, Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus. In contrast, the abundance of Proteobacteria, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas in breastmilk was higher in the food allergy group. A comparison of the changes in dominant differential breastmilk microbiota in the intestinal flora of the two groups of infants over time revealed that the changes in Bifidobacterium abundance were consistent with those in the breastmilk flora. Functional pathway prediction of breastmilk microflora showed that the enhancement of the metabolic pathways of tyrosine, tryptophan, and fatty acids was significantly different between the groups. We suggest that changes in the breastmilk microbiota can influence the development of food allergies. Breastmilk contains several microbes that have protective effects against food allergies, both by influencing the colonization of intestinal microbiota and by producing butyrate. This study may provide new ideas for improving infant health through early intervention with probiotics.",-1
"Alteration of gut microbiota composition and function of Indian major carp, rohu (Labeo rohita) infected with Argulus siamensis","Gut microbiome homeostasis is critical in preventing diseases. However, the effect of disease on gut microbiota assembly remains unclear. At present, there are no reports on the composition and functional analysis of intestinal microbiota of Indian major carp, rohu (L. rohita) infected with ectoparasite, Argulus. In this study, we analysed and compared the intestinal microbiota of healthy and Argulus-infected rohu by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Argulus infection could significantly influence the diversity and richness of the gut microbiota. However, abundance of Actinobacteria and Patescibacteria were enriched significantly in Argulus-infected fish. Venn diagram revealed that there were many more unique genera in the infected group as compared to control fish. The genera, Stenotrophomonas and Pirellula were significantly increased in infected fish while the abundance of Reyranella was decreased. LEfSe analysis showed a significant enrichment in abundances of 11 taxa in healthy group and 17 taxa in infected group. Furthermore, genera Rubellimicrobium, Dielma, Hyphomicrobium, Reyranella, Streptomyces and Cloacibacterium performed the best in differentiating between both the groups. Predicted microbiota function by PICRUSt revealed that the gut microbiota of infected fish was mainly associated with enriched synthesis of chitinases, chitin binding proteins, osmoprotectant proteins and sulfatases enzymes. There was a positive association between the structural and functional composition of the gut microbiota. The results indicated that the Argulus infection could affect the intestinal microbiota composition and function of rohu.",-1
LncRNA NEAT1 alleviates ischemic stroke via transcriptional inhibition of NLRP3 mediated by the miRâ?0bâ?p/BCL6 axis,"Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) is a significant cause of disability and death. Inflammation usually occurs after CIS and accelerates cellular damage. NLRP3 plays a key role in the formation of CISâassociated inflammasome. Understanding how NLRP3 is regulated bears great importance. We hypothesized that lncRNA NEAT1 can downregulate NLRP3 expression by regulating the miRâ?0bâ?p/BCL6 axis, and thus regulate microgliaâdriven inflammation. The expression of NEAT1 was analyzed in CIS patients and an in vitro model of oxygen and glucose deprivation/reâoxygenation (OGD/R). We assessed the levels of proâinflammatory cytokines ILâ?8 and ILâ?Î² with ELISA. Interactions between NEAT1/miRâ?0bâ?p and miRâ?0bâ?p/BCL6 were determined by luciferase assay. The interaction of BCL6 and NLRP3 was identified by ChIP; RNA, and protein levels were evaluated by qRTâPCR and western blot, respectively. We found that NEAT1 level was decreased in CIS patients and OGD/R treated cells. OGD/R exerted proâinflammasome effects by increasing the expression of inflammasomeâassociated proteins and ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) while inhibiting SOD production. This effect was partially antagonized by NEAT1. We bioinformatically identified interactions between NEAT1/miRâ?0bâ?p, BCL6/miRâ?0bâ?p, and NLRP3âpromoter/BCL6, and validated them by luciferase assay, qRTâPCR, and ChIP. NEAT1 inhibited miRâ?0bâ?p and upregulated BCL6 by ceRNA mechanism and alleviated OGD/R induced cell damage. We also proved that BCL6 was a repressive transcription factor in the regulation of NLRP3 expression. Thus, lncRNA NEAT1 inhibited inflammasome activation by NLRP3 in microglia via the NEAT1/ miRâ?0bâ?p/BCL6/NLRP3 regulatory axis, which alleviated deleterious outcomes of ischemic stroke.",-1
"L-DOPA, a treatment for Parkinson's disease, and its enantiomer D-DOPA inhibit severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus infection in vitro","Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a hemorrhagic fever. Patients mainly develop fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. A high case fatality rate of 16.2-47% has been reported. Vaccines and antivirals that are effective against SFTS virus (SFTSV) are not yet available in clinical practice. We previously showed that o-dihydroxybenzene is the important chemical core structure for anti-SFTSV activity. In this study, we evaluated the anti-SFTSV efficacy of 3-Hydroxy-L-tyrosine (L-DOPA), a treatment for Parkinson's disease and its enantiomer, 3-hydroxy-D-tyrosine (D-DOPA), both of which have an o-dihydroxybenzene backbone. SFTSV was preincubated with L- or D-DOPA and then inhibition of viral infection as well as viral attachment to host cells were evaluated by viral quantification. Both L- and D-DOPA inhibited SFTSV infection in a dose-dependent manner, mainly by blocking viral attachment to host cells. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of L-DOPA was 4.46-5.09 Î¼M. IC50 of D-DOPA was 4.23-6.72 Î¼M. IC50 of L-DOPA is very close to its maximum blood concentration after oral administration as a therapy for Parkinson's disease. D-DOPA, which IC50 was almost the same as that of L-DOPA, might not cause side effect. Thus, our present study demonstrated that L- and D-DOPA are potentially useful candidates for anti-SFTSV drugs.",-1
Simplifying the screening of gestational diabetes by maternal age plus fasting plasma glucose at first prenatal visit: A prospective cohort study,"Aim:                    The addition of maternal age to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at 24-28 gestational weeks improves the performance of GDM screening as maternal age increases. However, this method delays the diagnosis of GDM. Since FPG at the first prenatal visit (FPV) is a screening option for pre-existing diabetes, we evaluated the performance of age plus FPG at the FPV to reduce the need for the OGTT.              Methods:                    Pregnant women were recruited consecutively in 2013-2018 (the training cohort) and 2019 (the validation cohort). We excluded women with twin pregnancies, unavailable FPG at the FPV or OGTT data, pre-pregnancy diabetes, or a history of GDM. All participants underwent FPG and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at the FPV and received 75-g OGTT at 24-28 gestational weeks if FPG at the FPV was <92 mg/dL. GDM was diagnosed by the IADPSG criteria. Two algorithms were developed with the cutoffs determined when the percentage requiring OGTT (OGTT%) was the lowest and the sensitivity was â?0%.              Results:                    The incidence of GDM increased with age. The ""FPG at the FPV"" algorithm reduced OGTT% to 68.8% with the FPG cutoff at 79 mg/dl. The ""age plus FPG at the FPV"" algorithm, with the cutoff of 114, further reduced OGTT% to 58.3%, with the sensitivity of 90.7% (9.3% GDM missed) and the specificity of 100%. These findings were replicated in the validation cohort.              Conclusions:                    Screening GDM by maternal age plus FPG at the FPV can reduce OGTT%, especially in populations with a significant proportion of pregnant women with advanced ages.",-1
Childhood BMI and Fasting Glucose and Insulin Predict Adult Type 2 Diabetes: The International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort (i3C) Consortium,"Objective:                    To examine childhood BMI, fasting glucose, and insulin in relation to incident adult type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).              Research design and methods:                    We used data from the International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort (i3C) Consortium. Data included childhood (age 3-19 years) measurements obtained during the 1970s-1990s; a health questionnaire, including self-report of adult T2DM (occurrence age, medication use) obtained at mean age 40 years; and a medical diagnosis registry (Finland).              Results:                    The sample included 6,738 participants. Of these, 436 (6.5%) reported onset of T2DM between ages 20 and 59 (mean 40.8) years, and 86% of them reported use of a confirmed antidiabetic medication. BMI and glucose (age and sex standardized) were associated with incident T2DM after adjustment for cohort, country, sex, race, age, and calendar year of measurement. Increasing levels of childhood BMI and glucose were related to an incrementally increased risk of T2DM beginning at age 30 years, beginning at cut points <95th percentile for BMI and <100 mg/dL for glucose. Insulin was positively associated with adult T2DM after adjustment for BMI and glucose and added to T2DM discrimination.              Conclusions:                    Childhood BMI and glucose are predictors of adult T2DM at levels previously considered to be within the normal range. These easy-to-apply measurements are appealing from a clinical perspective. Fasting insulin has the potential to be an additional predictor.",-1
Prediction of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand in the Buriganga River of Bangladesh using novel hybrid machine learning algorithms,"Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is one of the most important variables indicating stream pollution with a severe condition of organic loading and maintaining aquatic life in ecosystems. Advanced monitoring techniques such as machine learning (ML) methods have been developed for an accurate, reliable, and cost-effective prediction of BOD. This study investigated the effectiveness of four stand-alone ML algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM), and six novel hybrid algorithms, namely, RF-SVM, ANN-SVM, GBM-SVM, RF-ANN, GBM-ANN, and RF-GBM, in predicting BOD of the Buriganga river system of Bangladesh. The feature importance analysis of RF algorithm indicated that chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, total solids (TS), suspended solids (SS), and turbidity are the most influential parameters for predicting BOD5 . The significance of this study is the application of the novel hybrid models that resulted in higher prediction success; RF-SVM with the highest R2 value (0.908). The employed novel hybrid ML models can be particularly useful for efficient and systematic data management, water pollution control, and prevention in developing countries such as Bangladesh. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Investigated the efficiency of four stand-alone and six novel hybrid ML models for predicting BOD in a river of Bangladesh. The significance of this study is the application of the six novel hybrid models that resulted in higher prediction success. The best three prediction models were RF-SVM, ANN-SVM, and GBM-SVM with a prediction success of 91%, 89.6%, and 88.8% respectively. ML models indicated COD, conductivity, TDS, TS, SS, and turbidity as the most influential variables for predicting BOD. The novel hybrid models can be useful for developing countries for efficient systematic data management, pollution control, and prevention strategies.",-1
Screening and Analysis of Biomarkers in the miRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network of Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma is a malignant disease, and few effective strategies can completely overcome the prognosis of these patients. This study attempted to reveal the key factors and related molecular mechanisms of osteosarcoma via excavating public microarray datasets. The data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database; the differentially expressed miRNAs and differentially expressed genes were obtained in GSE69470 and GSE12685l, respectively; the target of miRNAs were predicted with the miRDIP database; the functions of the factors were analyzed and visualized by the David database and R language, respectively. Moreover, the protein-protein interaction network and miRNA-mRNA network were performed with the STRING database and Cytoscape software to identify the hub nodes in GSE69470 and GSE12685. The results showed that 834 DEGs were found in GSE12685 and 37 miRNAs were found in GSE69470. Moreover, the target of 37 miRNAs were enriched in PI3K/AKT, P53, Wnt/Î²-catenin, and TGF-Î² pathways and related with skeletal system development and cell growth. Besides, the miRNAs including miR-22-3p, miR-154-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-485-3p, miR-93-5p, and miR-9-5p and the genes including LEF1, RUNX2, CSF1R, CDKN1A, and FBN1 were identified as the hub nodes via network analysis. In conclusion, this study suggested that the miRNAs including miR-22-3p, miR-154-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-485-3p, miR-93-5p, and miR-9-5p and the genes including LEF1, RUNX2, CSF1R, CDKN1A, and FBN1 act as key factors in the progression of osteosarcoma.",-1
"Correlation between basal metabolic rate, visceral fat and insulin resistance among type 2 diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy","Background:                    Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) means the amount of energy utilized by body in physical and psychological resting rate, after a night sleep, awake without any previous physical activity post meal (10 h after last meal) & neutral environment. In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) there is an increase in BMR which is said to be associated with the level of glycaemic control. So, the objective of the study was to find out the correlation between BMR, Insulin resistance and Visceral fat in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.              Materials & methods:                    A total of 50 participants with T2DM with peripheral neuropathy were included. Age group of 30-75 years were selected for the study. Participants with a known history of neurological disease, locomotor disability, and pregnancy were excluded from the study. Demographic details of the participants like duration of diabetes mellitus, age, Fasting Blood Glucose, Fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR, Glycated Haemoglobin (HBA1c), Neuropathy and Blood pressure values were noted. We measured Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by using Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.              Results:                    The mean age of the participants is 60.16 Â± 10.62. The mean duration of T2DM 13.44 Â± 11.92. In the present study we found a statistical significant correlation between BMR and HOMA IR (r = 0.913*; p = 0.000), BMR & Fasting blood sugar (FBS) (r = 0.281*; p = 0.048), BMR and Visceral fat (VF) (r = 0.332*; p = 0.018).              Conclusion:                    Basal metabolic rate is correlated to Homa-IR, visceral fat, fasting blood sugar and musculoskeletal mass among T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.",-1
Cutaneous infection due to Bacillus cereus: a case report,"Background:                    Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive bacterium that can be found in various natural and human-made environments. It is often involved in gastrointestinal infections and food poisoning; yet, it can rarely cause serious non-gastrointestinal tract infections.              Case presentation:                    Here we describe a case of B. cereus cutaneous infection of a wound on the hand of a young woman from a rural area in Iran. On admission, she had no systemic symptoms other than a cutaneous lesion. The identification of the causative agent was performed using sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of the bacteria isolated from the wound. The isolated microorganism was identified as B. cereus. Targeted antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin was successful.              Discussion and conclusion:                    Although non-intestinal infections caused by B. cereus are rare, it should be taken into consideration that this organism might also cause infections in other parts of the body.",-1
Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with impaired insulin secretion and fasting glucose in non-obese non-diabetic men,"Aims/introduction:                    A low insulin secretion capacity has been implicated in the high prevalence of non-obese diabetes in East Asians. As alcohol consumption alters insulin and glucose metabolism, we tested the hypothesis that alcohol consumption contributes to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in lean/normal-weight non-diabetic Japanese men.              Materials and methods:                    This cross-sectional study was undertaken among the residents of Shika town, Japan, between 2011 and 2017. A total of 402 non-diabetic men, including participants with normal fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and impaired FPG (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L), and aged â?0 years, were examined. FPG, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin secretion capacity (HOMA-B) and alcohol consumption were evaluated and compared between the body mass index (BMI) <25 and BMI â?5 groups.              Results:                    HOMA-B levels were lower in the BMI <25 group than in the BMI â?5 group. Alcohol consumption correlated with a low HOMA-B level regardless of BMI, and, thus, the HOMA-B levels of alcohol drinkers were significantly lower in the BMI <25 group. A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that alcohol consumption, even light-to-moderate consumption (1-25 g/day), was associated with significantly low levels of HOMA-B and impaired FPG in the BMI <25 group. Among participants with impaired FPG, a low level of HOMA-B was observed in alcohol drinkers, but not in non-drinkers. In contrast, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was not related to HOMA-B or FPG in the BMI â?5-group.              Conclusion:                    Alcohol consumption, even a small amount, might contribute to reductions in HOMA-B levels and impaired FPG in lean/normal-weight Japanese men.",-1
"Acteoside, the Main Bioactive Compound in Osmanthus fragrans Flowers, Palliates Experimental Colitis in Mice by Regulating the Gut Microbiota","The present study investigated the effects of Osmanthus fragrans flowers and acteoside on murine colitis and the underlying mechanisms. The O. fragrans flower extract (OFE) and acteoside were administrated to chemically induced colitic mice. The results showed that OFE or acteoside ameliorates intestinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) in colitic mice. The dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in colitic mice was also partly restored by OFE or acteoside, which was characterized by the alteration of the gut microbiome structure and the enrichment of beneficial bacteria (Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron). Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced gut metabolome dysfunctions (e.g., sphingosine metabolism and amino acids metabolism) in colitic mice were also partly restored by OFE and acteoside. A fecal microbiota (FM) transplantation study suggested that, compared with the FM from the normal diet-dosed donor mice, the FM from the OFE- or acteoside-dosed donor mice significantly suppressed colitic symptoms.",-1
An evaluation of repellency and feeding inhibition of ethno-medicinal plants against major malaria vectors in southern Ethiopia,"Background:                    Plant-based mosquito control methods may use as a supplementary malaria vector control strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of smoking ethno-medicinal plants on indoor density and feeding activity of malaria vectors at early hours of the night and its residual effect after midnight in southern Ethiopia.              Methods:                    Both field and tent trials were conducted to evaluate the impact of smoking Juniperus procera leaves, Eucalyptus globulus seeds and Olea europaea leaves in Kolla Shara Village from July 2016 to February 2017. For the field trial, five grass-thatched traditional huts (three for ethno-medicinal plants and two as control [only charcoal smoking and non-charcoal smoking]) were used. Indoor host-seeking mosquitoes were collected by CDC light traps. A Latin square design was employed to minimize the bias due to the variation in house location and different sampling nights. For the tent experiment, 25 3-5-day-old starved wild female Anopheles mosquitoes reared from the larvae were released into the tents where a calf was tethered at the mid-point of each tent.              Results:                    A total of 614 Anopheles mosquitoes belonging to 5 species were collected from 5 huts, of which 93.4% was An. arabiensis; O. europaea, E. globulus and J. procera reduced the indoor density of An. arabiensis, with the mean percentage drop of 80%, 73% and 70%, respectively. In the tent trial, smoking of these plants had significant knockdown effects and inhibited feeding on the calves (F = 383.5, DF = 3, P < 0.01). The mean knockdown effect due to O. europaea was relatively high (17.7 Â± 0.54; 95% CI 16.8-18.6), while it was only 0.9 Â± 0.1 (95% CI 0.29-1.52) in the control tents. All the test plants used in the tent trial caused significantly inhibited feeding activity of An. arabiensis on the host (F = 383.5, DF = 3, P < 0.01). About 94.5%, 89.5% and 86% of mosquitoes were unfed because of the smoking effect of O. europaea, E. globulus and J. procera, respectively, whereas only 19.5% were unfed in the control tent.              Conclusions:                    Smoking ethno-medicinal plant materials reduced indoor density of malaria vectors and inhibited feeding on calves inside the tents. Thus, plant-based mosquito control methods may play a vital role in reducing mosquito bites in the early hours of the night and thereby reduce residual malaria transmission.",-1
"Detection of DENV-2 and Insect-Specific Flaviviruses in Mosquitoes Collected From Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Background:                    Mosquito-borne diseases are rapidly spreading due to increasing international travel and trade. Routine mosquito surveillance and screening for mosquito-borne pathogens can be early indicators for local disease transmission and outbreaks. However, arbovirus detection in mosquito vectors has rarely been reported in Saudi Arabia.              Methods:                    A total of 769,541 Aedes and Culex mosquitoes were collected by Black Hole traps during routine mosquito surveillance in the first half of 2016. Culex. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti were the most prevalent species observed. Twenty-five and 24 randomly selected pools of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively, were screened for arboviruses by RT-PCR.              Results:                    Dengue 2 (DENV-2) and four strains of insect-specific flaviviruses, including one of cell-fusing agent virus (CFAV) and three of Phlebotomus-associated flavivirus (PAFV) were detected in pools of Ae. aegypti. We also detected 10 strains of Culex flavivirus (CxFV) in pools of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Phylogenetic analysis using whole genome sequences placed the DENV strain into the cosmopolitan 1 sub-DENV-2 genotype, and the CxFVs into the African/Caribbean/Latin American genotype. These analyses also showed that the DENV-2 strain detected in the present study was closely related to strains detected in China in 2014 and in Japan in 2018, which suggests frequent movement of DENV-2 strains among these countries. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis suggested at least five introductions of DENV-2 into Saudi Arabia from 2014 through 2018, most probably from India.              Conclusions:                    To our knowledge, this study reports the first detection of four arboviruses DENV, CFAV, PAFV, and CxFV in mosquitoes in Saudi Arabia, which shows that they are co-circulating in Jeddah. Our findings show a need for widespread mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance programs in Saudi Arabia, which will improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the mosquito-borne arboviruses within the country and help early predict and mitigate the risk of human infections and outbreaks.",-1
APOE genetics influence murine gut microbiome,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles impact pathogenesis and risk for multiple human diseases, making them primary targets for disease treatment and prevention. Previously, we and others reported an association between APOE alleles and the gut microbiome. Here, we evaluated effects of APOE heterozygosity and tested whether these overall results extended to mice maintained under ideal conditions for microbiome analyses. To model human APOE alleles, this study used APOE targeted replacement (TR) mice on a C57Bl/6 background. To minimize genetic drift, homozygous APOE3 mice were crossed to homozygous APOE2 or homozygous APOE4 mice prior to the study, and the resulting heterozygous progeny crossed further to generate the study mice. To maximize environmental homogeneity, mice with mixed genotypes were housed together and used bedding from the cages was mixed and added back as a portion of new bedding. Fecal samples were obtained from mice at 3-, 5- and 7-months of age, and microbiota analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Linear discriminant analysis of effect size (LefSe) identified taxa associated with APOE status, depicted as cladograms to show phylogenetic relatedness. The influence of APOE status was tested on alpha-diversity (Shannon H index) and beta-diversity (principal coordinate analyses and PERMANOVA). Individual taxa associated with APOE status were identified by classical univariate analysis. Whether findings in the APOE mice were replicated in humans was evaluated by using published microbiome genome wide association data. Cladograms revealed robust differences with APOE in male mice and limited differences in female mice. The richness and evenness (alpha-diversity) and microbial community composition (beta-diversity) of the fecal microbiome was robustly associated with APOE status in male but not female mice. Classical univariate analysis revealed individual taxa that were significantly increased or decreased with APOE, illustrating a stepwise APOE2-APOE3-APOE4 pattern of association with heterozygous animals trending as intermediate in the stepwise pattern. The relative abundance of bacteria from the class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, family Ruminococacceae and related genera increased with APOE2 status. The relative abundance of Erysipelotrichia increased with APOE4 status, a finding that extended to humans. In this study, wherein mice were maintained in an ideal fashion for microbiome studies, gut microbiome profiles were strongly and significantly associated with APOE status in male APOE-TR mice. Erysipelotrichia are increased with APOE4 in both mice and humans. APOE allelic effects appeared generally intermediate in heterozygous animals. Further evaluation of these findings in humans, as well as studies evaluating the impact of the APOE-associated microbiota on disease-relevant phenotypes, will be necessary to determine if alterations in the gut microbiome represent a novel mechanism whereby APOE alleles impact disease.",-1
[Analysis of glucose changes in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus within 1 year after using mobile APP decision support system],"Objective: To analyze the changes in glucose after using a decision support system (DSS) of a smartphone mobile application (APP) in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: In the intervention study, the data (including general information at the time of registration) of adult T1DM patients enrolled in the Chinese T1DM Registration Management Project and registered with TangTangQuanÂ® APP were collected. Within 1 year after registration, fasting blood glucose, pre-prandial and postprandial blood glucose at the three meals, blood glucose before bedtime and in nocturnal time were collected every 3 months. Frequencies of total recorded glucose values and proportion of different ranges of glycemia were also collected and analyzed, including the range between 3.9-7.8 mmol/L (Euglycemia), ranged below 3.9 mmol/L (Hypoglycemia) and range above 13.9 mmol/L (hyperglycemia). The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the daily use frequency of DSS (Low/Moderate/High frequency groups). The changes in point blood glucose, the proportion of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia over time were compared among different groups, as well as the baseline characteristics and glucose characteristics of patients. Results: A total of 629 eligible T1DM patients were included, including 216 (34.3%) males and 413 (65.7%) females, aged (31.5Â±10.8) years, and disease duration [M(Q1, Q3)] of 1.2 (0.1, 7.4) years. There were 239, 189 and 201 patients in the low, moderate and high frequency groups, respectively. Significant differences were observed among the three groups in all timepoints of self-monitoring blood glucose except for the glucose before bedtime from 10 to 12 months after registration (all P values<0.05), and the glucose level at each point in the high frequency group was lower than that in the other two groups. In the first three months after registration, there was no difference in the proportion of hypoglycemia among the three groups (P>0.05). However, from 10 to 12 months after registration, the proportion [M(Q1, Q3)] of hypoglycemia [3.34% (0.85%, 7.40%), 3.00% (0.78%, 6.17%), 1.81% (0.37%, 4.69%)] (P=0.022) between groups (from low to high frequency groups) and hyperglycemia [4.04% (0, 12.16%), 1.88% (0, 7.80%), 0.81% (0, 3.87%)] (P=0.001) were significantly different. Conclusions: The DSS function of mobile APP is helpful to the glucose management of adult patients with T1DM within 1 year after registration. The average blood glucose in adults with T1DM decreased, and the proportions of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were also reduced.",-1
miR-185-5p Regulates Inflammation and Phagocytosis through CDC42/JNK Pathway in Macrophages,"Macrophage activation is an essential component of systemic chronic inflammation and chronic inflammatory diseases. Emerging evidence implicates miR-185-5p in chronic inflammation diseases. However, the regulatory role of miR-185-5p in macrophage pro-inflammatory activation has not been studied previously. Here, we identified that miR-185-5p was one of the top genes and effectively downregulated in two macrophage miRNA expression datasets from GEO. Under LPS stress, miR-185-5p overexpression reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, suppressed phagocytosis in RAW264.7 macrophage. miR-185-5p inhibitors augmented pro-inflammatory effects of LPS in macrophage. Mechanically, miR-185-5p sponged and negatively regulated the protein expression of CDC42. Ablation of CDC42 with selective CDC42 inhibitor CASIN reversed the pro-inflammatory effect of miR-185-5p inhibitors through inhibiting MAPK/JNK pathways. Collectively, these data demonstrate that miR-185-5p exhibited anti-inflammatory functions in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages at least partially through CDC42/JNK pathways. Our findings yield insights into the understanding of miR-185-5p-regulated network in macrophages inflammation, which is beneficial for exploring miRNA-protein interaction in atherosclerotic inflammation.",-1
"A High-Fat High-Fructose Diet Dysregulates the Homeostatic Crosstalk Between Gut Microbiome, Metabolome, and Immunity in an Experimental Model of Obesity","Scope:                    Ample evidence supports the prominent role of gut-liver axis in perpetuating pathological networks of high-fat high-fructose (HFF) diet induced metabolic disorders, however, the molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. Herein, this study aims to present a holistic delineation and scientific explanation for the crosstalk between the gut and liver, including the potential mediators involved in orchestrating the metabolic and immune systems.              Methods and results:                    An experimental obesity-associated metaflammation rat model is induced with a HFF diet. An integrative multi-omics analysis is then performed. Following the clues illustrated by the multi-omics discoveries, putative pathways are subsequently validated by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. HFF diet leads to obese phenotypes in rats, as well as histopathological changes. Integrated omics analysis shows that there exists a strong interdependence among gut microbiota composition, intestinal metabolites, and innate immunity regulation in the liver. Some carboxylic acids may contribute to gut-liver communication. Moreover, activation of the hepatic LPS-TLR4 pathway in obesity is confirmed.              Conclusion:                    HFF-intake disturbs gut flora homeostasis. Crosstalk between gut microbiota and innate immune system mediates hepatic metaflammation in obese rats, associated with LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway activation. Moreover, Î±-hydroxyisobutyric acid and some other organic acids may play a role as messengers in the liver-gut axis.",-1
High pre-operative fasting blood glucose levels predict a poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour,"Background:                    Hyperglycaemia has been indicated as a pro-tumoural factor; however, the prognostic role of diabetes mellitus (DM) in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (panNETs) remains ambiguous, partly due to the effects of anti-diabetic drugs. We hypothesise that the blood sugar level per se affects the outcome of panNETs, and thus, we investigated the prognostic significance of the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level in resected panNET patients with no pre-existing DM.              Methods:                    A retrospective cohort study comprising 201 patients with radically resected non-functional panNETs was conducted. A total of 164 patients without pre-existing DM were further studied. An FBG level greater than 5.6 mmol/L was defined as high (otherwise, normal). Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and log-rank tests. Multivariate analyses for survival were performed using the Cox regression model.              Results:                    High FBG levels were significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS; p = 0.019) and recurrence-free survival (RFS; p = 0.011) in resected patients with panNET who had no pre-existing DM. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality and recurrence comparing patients with high and normal FBG levels were 12.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-128.78, p = 0.038) and 2.43 (95% CI = 1.03-5.72, p = 0.042), respectively.              Conclusion:                    A pre-operative FBG level greater than 5.6 mmol/L is associated with poor OS and RFS metastasis for patients with panNET who undergo radical surgical resection.",-1
Strength and Conditioning Coaches' Perceptions of Sport Psychology Strategies,"Quartiroli, A, Moore, EWG, and Zakrajsek, RA. Strength and conditioning coaches' perceptions of sport psychology strategies. . J Strength Cond Res 36(5): 1327-1334, 2022-Strength and conditioning coaches (SCCs) hold a central role in the development of student-athletes. Although they certainly focus on student-athletes' physical skill development, SCCs are in an ideal position to integrate mental skills into their strength and conditioning sessions. For example, sport psychology (SP) strategies can be used within strength and conditioning sessions to assist in athlete exercise execution by regulating arousal, improving concentration, confidence, as well as improve self-correction through self-talk and imagery. The purpose of this study was to assess collegiate SCCs' use of SP skills/strategies. A total sample of 415 SCCs (19.7% return rate) across the United States participated in an online survey. Although the majority of these coaches reported having less than moderate training in SP (59.9%), they also reported a moderate to high use of certain SP strategies (e.g., goal setting, self-talk). Strength and conditioning coaches' familiarity with, knowledge of, and confidence to use the SP strategies were found to be predictors of SCCs' frequency of SP strategy use. This study aimed to provide an initial exploration of SCCs' understanding and use of specific SP strategies, which was influenced by the SCCs' perceived level of preparation to use these strategies. For SCCs to be able to purposefully and confidently incorporate SP strategies into training sessions, the current study suggests the need for specific training aimed to enhance the SCCs' knowledge of and confidence in using specific SP strategies.",-1
Depleted Long Noncoding RNA GAS5 Relieves Intervertebral Disc Degeneration via microRNA-17-3p/Ang-2,"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) remains a clinical challenge and requires more effective therapeutic targets. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical modulators of multiple biological processes, such as cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Accordingly, the current study sets out to explore the influence of the lncRNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) on IVDD and investigate the possible involvement of microRNA-17-3p (miR-17-3p)/Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) axis. Firstly, the expression patterns of GAS5, miR-17-3p, and Ang-2 were characterized by RNA quantification from the isolated human degenerative nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues. miR-17-3p was found to express at an abnormal low level while GAS5 and Ang-2 expressed at aberrant high level in the human degenerative NP tissues. Utilizing dual-luciferase reporter, RNA immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays, GAS5 was found to competitively bound to miR-17-3p and further upregulate the expression of Ang-2, a target gene of miR-17-3p. Employing gain- and loss-of-function approaches, their expressions were altered in human degenerative nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs), followed by IL-1Î² treatment, in order to identify their roles in NP cell proliferation, apoptosis, and ECM metabolism. Silencing of GAS5 expression restrained the levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-7, cleaved caspase-9, MMP3, MMP13, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS5 and increased collagen II and aggrecan levels. In vitro experiments also revealed that GAS5 depletion inhibited apoptosis and ECM degradation in HDNPCs, while elevating the proliferation through downregulation of Ang-2 by increasing miR-17-3p. Furthermore, in vivo data further validated that either GAS5 silencing or miR-17-3p reexpression alleviated IVDD degree with the help of IVDD mouse models. Altogether, our findings substantiated that downregulation of GAS5 reduced NPC apoptosis and promoted ECM remodeling, ultimately ameliorating the IVDD via miR-17-3p-dependent inhibition of Ang-2. We hope our discoveries offer a fresh molecular insight that can aid the development of novel therapies against IVDD.",-1
"Multifunctional biosensor constructed by Ag-coating magnetic-assisted unique urchin core porous shell structure for dual SERS enhancement, enrichment, and quantitative detection of multi-components inflammatory markers","The simultaneous, precise, and quantitative detection of multi-components inflammatory markers (IMs) in sepsis serum by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) remains a challenging problem. A novel, multifunctional biosensor with dual enrichment and enhancement was designed for the ultrasensitive and quantitative analysis of multi-components IMs. The biosensor contains SERS tags-unique urchin core/porous shell (CPS) structure modified with Raman reporters (RaRs), magnetic assist-Ag coated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (Ag MNPs) modified with internal standard (IS), and then aptamer (Apt) modification to form the sandwich structure (Ag MNPs/IMs/CPS). This multifunctional sensor used for IMS detection has the following innovations: The intensity ratio IRaRs/IIS with Lg CIMs present a good and wide linear relationship to achieve the simultaneous, precise, and quantitative detection of IMS in serum; The detection results display ultrasensitivity, and the limit of detection (LOD) for CRP, IL-6, and PCT is 100 fg/mL, 0.1 fg/mL, and 1.0 fg/mL, which is lower than other detection techniques; The calculated data of clinical blood samples of sepsis by this SERS method is consistent with the hospital results, and can provide more compositional data of IMs. Thus, this combined approach developed a sensing platform for rapid screening, accurate evaluation, early warning, and diagnosis of sepsis.",-1
"Persistent Hepatitis B Viraemia with Polymerase Mutations among HIV/HBV Co-Infected Patients on HBV-Active ART in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","To understand the problem of persistent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) viraemia in HIV/HBV co-infected patients on HBV-active antiretroviral therapy (ART), we assessed the rate of HBV virological response in patients on HBV-active ART in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and analysed factors associated with persistent HBV viraemia. One hundred and fifty eligible participants with a chronic HBV diagnosis, with or without HIV coinfection, were enrolled and followed up after 6 months. The HBV pol gene was sequenced by next-generation sequencing and mutations were determined using the Stanford HBVseq database. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with HBV viraemia at 6-month follow-up. The mean duration of HBV-active ART was 24 months. Thirty-seven of one hundred and six (35%) participants receiving HBV-active ART for longer than 6 months had virological failure. Advanced immunosuppression with CD4+ cell counts &lt;200 cells/Î¼L was independently associated with persistent HBV viraemia, aOR 5.276 (95% CI 1.575-17.670) p = 0.007. A high proportion of patients on HBV-active ART are unsuppressed, which will ultimately have an impact on global elimination goals. Better monitoring should be implemented, especially in HIV-coinfected patients with low CD4+ cell counts and followed by early HBV drug-resistance testing.",-1
The Role of Cytokines and Chemokines in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infections,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in countless infections and caused millions of deaths since its emergence in 2019. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated mortality is caused by uncontrolled inflammation, aberrant immune response, cytokine storm, and an imbalanced hyperactive immune system. The cytokine storm further results in multiple organ failure and lung immunopathology. Therefore, any potential treatments should focus on the direct elimination of viral particles, prevention strategies, and mitigation of the imbalanced (hyperactive) immune system. This review focuses on cytokine secretions of innate and adaptive immune responses against COVID-19, including interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and other chemokines. In addition to the review focus, we discuss potential immunotherapeutic approaches based on relevant pathophysiological features, the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and data from recent clinical trials and experiments on the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm. Prompt use of these cytokines as diagnostic markers and aggressive prevention and management of the cytokine storm can help determine COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. The prophylaxis and rapid management of the cytokine storm appear to significantly improve disease outcomes. For these reasons, this study aims to provide advanced information to facilitate innovative strategies to survive in the COVID-19 pandemic.",-1
[Intestinal microbiome and its relationship with necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight preterm infants],"Objective: To explore the composition of intestinal microflora prior to onset of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very low birth weight preterm infants. Methods: This was a multicenter prospective nested case-control study. A total of 46 very low birth weight preterm infants (birth weight <1 500 g and gestional age <35 weeks) within 24 h of life admitted into Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Children's Hospital of Soochow University and Suzhou Municipal Hospital from April 20 to November 20, 2018 were enrolled. Baseline clinical data and fecal samples of these infants were collected. The subsequent sampling time points were 1st, 4th and 7th day in the first week of life then once per week consecutively. The endpoint of sampling was NEC occurrence, patient discharge or the 8th week post-discharge, whichever came first. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16 S rDNA high-throughput nucleotide sequencing. The control cases were infants without NEC who were matched to the NEC cases with a ratio of 1â?. The operational taxonomic units (OTU), sequence number and shannon diversity index of the fecal samples were analyzed. Continuous variables were compared with t-test or non-parametric test, and Ï2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables. Results: There were 23 patients in each group. The gestational age was (29.4Â±1.8) weeks in NEC group and (29.9Â±1.6) weeks in control group, including 13 males (57%) and 11 males (48%) in each group, respectively. Species abundance showed that the Firmicutes in both groups decreased temporarily at 7 days of age and then increased with age in control group, but not in NEC group, the Proteobacteria in both groups increased at 7 days of age and then decreased in control group, but kept increasing in NEC group. Regarding the other levels of taxonomy, compared with that of the control group, the NEC group had lower abundance of Proteobacteria, Î³-proteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae at 7 days of age, while higer abundance of Faecalibacterium at 14 days of age, meanwhile, lower Clostridium and Streptococcus at 21 days of age, lower Firmicutes, Clostridia and Clostridium perfringens and higher Proteobacteria and Î³-proteobacteria at 28 days of age, these differences were all statistically significant (U=43.00, 43.00, 45.00, 80.00, 74.00, 76.00, 19.00, 8.00, 36.00, 25.00, 25.00,all P<0.05). The shannon index of NEC group was both lower than that of the controls at 21 days of age (2.4 (1.4, 3.0) vs. 3.1 (2.6, 4.0), U=67.00, P=0.027) and 28 days of age (2.4 (1.4, 2.8) vs. 3.9 (3.3, 4.2), U=12.00, P=0.001). Conclusions: The intestinal microflora profile of very low birth weight preterm infants has already changed prior to NEC development. The emergence of differential flora and the reduction of microflora diversity may facilitate early identification and prevention of NEC.",-1
The miR-145-MMP1 axis is a critical regulator for imiquimod-induced cancer stemness and chemoresistance,"Cancer stemness, chemoresistance, and metastasis are related biological events. However, whether they have common molecular mechanisms remains to be determined. Here, we report that imiquimod (IMQ) facilitates the acquisition of stem-cell-like properties and chemoresistance via the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and downregulation of microRNA-145 (miR-145). MiR-145-5p was found to suppress MMP1 expression through direct binding, and miR-145-mediated downregulation of MMP1 reversed the effects of IMQ. In addition, IMQ downregulated miR-145 by promoting DNA methylation at its promoter. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors limited IMQ-induced MMP1 expression, stemness, and chemoresistance. Collectively, our results highlight the miR-145-MMP1 axis as a potential coordinator of cancer stemness and chemoresistance. Given the role of MMP1 in the initiation of metastasis, the miR-145-MMP1 axis serves as a promising therapeutic target for improved cancer treatment.",-1
Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota affect absorption of cholecalciferol in severe osteoporosis,"Introduction:                    To evaluate the relationship between the gut microbial composition and intestinal cholecalciferol absorption in patients with severe osteoporosis (SOP).              Materials and methods:                    Eighteen patients with primary osteoporosis (OP) and 18 with SOP were included. Their clinical data were collected and their circulating concentrations of cholecalciferol and 25(OH)D3 were measured. Fecal samples were collected and their microbial contents were analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing.              Results:                    The age, sex, body mass index, and body mass of the participants did not differ between the groups. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in the participants with SOP was significantly higher than that in the participants with OP. There were significant differences in the 25(OH)D3 and cholecalciferol concentrations between participants with SOP or OP and there was a significant positive correlation between the concentrations of these substance. The diversity of the gut microbiota in participants with SOP was significantly higher than that in participants with OP. Firmicutes was more abundant in the SOP group and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in participants with SOP was higher. Conversely, Bifidobacterium was significantly less abundant, as were the order and family it belongs to. At the species level, Bifidobacterium was the most significant difference between the two groups.              Conclusion:                    Differences in the intestinal microecology, especially Bifidobacterium, are associated with differences in the absorption of cholecalciferol and in the circulating 25(OH)D3 concentration, which may influence the progression of OP to SOP.",-1
MicroRNA Roles in Cell Reprogramming Mechanisms,"Cell reprogramming is a groundbreaking technology that, in few decades, generated a new paradigm in biomedical science. To date we can use cell reprogramming to potentially generate every cell type by converting somatic cells and suitably modulating the expression of key transcription factors. This approach can be used to convert skin fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells as well as into a variety of differentiated and medically relevant cell types, including cardiomyocytes and neural cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying such striking cell phenotypes are still largely unknown, but in the last decade it has been proven that cell reprogramming approaches are significantly influenced by non-coding RNAs. Specifically, this review will focus on the role of microRNAs in the reprogramming processes that lead to the generation of pluripotent stem cells, neurons, and cardiomyocytes. As highlighted here, non-coding RNA-forced expression can be sufficient to support some cell reprogramming processes, and, therefore, we will also discuss how these molecular determinants could be used in the future for biomedical purposes.",-1
A Pesco-Mediterranean Diet With Intermittent Fasting: JACC Review Topic of the Week,"As opportunistic omnivores, humans are evolutionarily adapted to obtain calories and nutrients from both plant and animal food sources. Today, many people overconsume animal products, often-processed meats high in saturated fats and chemical additives. Alternatively, strict veganism can cause nutritional deficiencies and predispose to osteopenia, sarcopenia, and anemia. A logical compromise is a plant-rich diet with fish/seafood as principal sources of animal food. This paper reviews cumulative evidence regarding diet and health, incorporating data from landmark clinical trials of the Mediterranean diet and recommendations from recent authoritative guidelines, to support the hypothesis that a Pesco-Mediterranean diet is ideal for optimizing cardiovascular health. The foundation of this diet is vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains, and extra-virgin olive oil with fish/seafood and fermented dairy products. Beverages of choice are water, coffee, and tea. Time-restricted eating is recommended, whereby intermittent fasting is done for 12 to 16 h each day.",-1
Prevention and Management of Diabetes-Related Foot Ulcers through Informal Caregiver Involvement: A Systematic Review,"Background:                    The literature remains unclear whether involving informal caregivers in diabetes self-care could lead to improved diabetic foot outcomes for persons at risk and/or with foot ulcer. In this review, we synthesized evidence of the impact of interventions involving informal caregivers in the prevention and/or management of diabetes-related foot ulcers.              Methods:                    A systematic review based on PRISMA, and Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines was conducted. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial of the Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception to February 2021. The following MESH terms were used: diabetic foot, foot ulcer, foot disease, diabetes mellitus, caregiver, family caregiver ,and family. Experimental studies involving persons with diabetes, with or at risk of foot ulcers and their caregivers were included. Data were extracted from included studies and narrative synthesis of findings undertaken.              Results:                    Following the search of databases, 9275 articles were screened and 10 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were RCTs (n = 5), non-RCTs (n = 1), and prepoststudies (n = 4). Informal caregivers through the intervention programmes were engaged in diverse roles that resulted in improved foot ulcer prevention and/or management outcomes such as improved foot care behaviors, increased diabetes knowledge, decreased HbA1c (mmol/mol or %), improved wound healing, and decreased limb amputations rates. Engaging both caregivers and the person with diabetes in education and hands-on skills training on wound care and foot checks were distinctive characteristics of interventions that consistently produced improved foot self-care behavior and clinically significant improvement in wound healing.              Conclusion:                    Informal caregivers play diverse and significant roles that seem to strengthen interventions and resulted in improved diabetes-related foot ulcer prevention and/or management outcomes. However, there are multiple intervention types and delivery strategies, and these may need to be considered by researchers and practitioners when planning programs for diabetes-related foot ulcers.",-1
MICROBIOME AND UVEITIDES. A REVIEW,"Microorganisms inhabiting all surfaces of mucous membranes and skin and forming a complex ecosystem with the host is called microbiota. The term microbiome is used for the aggregate genome of microbiota. The microbiota plays important role in the mechanisms of number of physiological and pathological processes, especially of the hosts immune system. The origin and course of autoimmune diseases not only of the digestive tract, but also of the distant organs, including the eye, are significantly influenced by intestinal microbiota. The role of microbiota and its changes (dysbiosis) in the etiopathogenesis of uveitis has so far been studied mainly in experimental models. Reduction of severity of non-infectious intraocular inflammation in germ-free mice or in conventional mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics was observed in both the induced experimental autoimmune uveitis model (EAU) and the spontaneous R161H model. Studies have confirmed that autoreactive T cell activation occurs in the intestinal wall in the absence of retinal antigen. Recent experiments focused on the effect of probiotic administration on the composition of intestinal microbiota and on the course of autoimmune uveitis. Our study group demonstrated significant prophylactic effect of the administration of the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 on the intensity of inflammation in EAU. To date, only a few studies have been published investigating intestinal dysbiosis in patients with uveitis (e.g., in Behcets disease or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome). The results of preclinical studies will be presumably used in clinical practice, mainly in the sense of prophylaxis and therapy, such as change in the lifestyle, diet and especially the therapeutic use of probiotics or the transfer of faecal microbiota.",-1
Lipid-mediated phase separation of AGO proteins on the ER controls nascent-peptide ubiquitination,"AGO/miRNA-mediated gene silencing and ubiquitin-mediated protein quality control represent two fundamental mechanisms that control proper gene expression. Here, we unexpectedly discover that fly and human AGO proteins, which are key components in the miRNA pathway, undergo lipid-mediated phase separation and condense into RNP granules on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to control protein production. Phase separation on the ER is mediated by electrostatic interactions between a conserved lipid-binding motif within the AGOs and the lipid PI(4,5)P2. The ER-localized AGO condensates recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1 to catalyze nascent-peptide ubiquitination and coordinate with the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex to process unwanted protein products for proteasomal degradation. Collectively, our study provides insight into the understanding of post-transcription-translation coupling controlled by AGOs via lipid-mediated phase separation.",-1
Camera fusion for real-time temperature monitoring of neonates using deep learning,"The continuous monitoring of vital signs is a crucial aspect of medical care in neonatal intensive care units. Since cable-based sensors pose a potential risk for the immature skin of preterm infants, unobtrusive monitoring techniques using camera systems are increasingly investigated. The combination of deep learning-based algorithms and camera modalities such as RGB and infrared thermography can improve the development of cable-free methods for the extraction of vital parameters. In this study, a real-time approach for local extraction of temperatures on the body surface of neonates using a multi-modal clinical dataset was implemented. Therefore, a trained deep learning-based keypoint detector was used for body landmark prediction in RGB. Image registration was conducted to transfer the RGB points to the corresponding thermographic recordings. These landmarks were used to extract the body surface temperature in various regions to determine the central-peripheral temperature difference. A validation of the keypoint detector showed a mean average precision of 0.82. The registration resulted in mean absolute errors of 16.4 px (8.2 mm) for x and 22.4 px (11.2 mm) for y. The evaluation of the temperature extraction revealed a mean absolute error of 0.55 [Formula: see text]C. A final performance of 31 fps was observed on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module, which proves real-time capability on an embedded GPU system. As a result, the approach can perform real-time temperature extraction on a low-cost GPU module.",-1
"Association between Breakfast Skipping and the Metabolic Syndrome: The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2017","Background and Objectives: Recently, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Korea has increased rapidly. Current knowledge reflects the importance of dietary control in relation to the metabolic syndrome. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of skipping breakfast on the metabolic syndrome. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017 for the second year. A total of 3864 adults aged 20 to 64 were included in the study. We stratified the study population into three groups, based on breakfast patterns: the regular group, irregular group, and skipping group. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between skipping breakfast and the presence of metabolic syndrome. Results: We noted an increase in the proportion of metabolic syndrome cases as follows: skipping group (3.3%), irregular group (5.4%), and regular group (8.5%) (p < 0.001). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of metabolic syndrome in the skipping and irregular groups compared with the regular group were 0.68 (95% CI; 0.35 to 1.35) and 0.81 (95% CI; 0.51 to 1.28), respectively. In the 40-65-year-old age group, which had a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of metabolic syndrome in the skipping group compared with regular group were 0.78 (95%CI, 0.39 to 1.62). Conclusions: There was no significant correlation between skipping breakfast and risk factors of metabolic syndrome (after adjusting for risk factors), but a tendency of skipping breakfast to lower the risk of metabolic syndrome was observed. A rationale for these results is proposed through the association between skipping breakfast and intermittent fasting.",-1
"Effect of a freeze-dried coffee solution in a high-fat diet-induced obesity model in rats: Impact on inflammatory response, lipid profile, and gut microbiota","Coffee beans contain high polyphenol content, which have the potential to modulate the intestinal microbiota, and possibly attenuate weight gain and the associated dyslipidemia. This study investigated the effect of freeze-dried coffee solution (FCS) consumption on physiological parameters, lipid profile, and microbiota of Wistar rats fed a high-fat diet (HF) or control diet (CT). FCS combined with a high-fat diet increased the fecal and cecal Bifidobacterium spp. population and decreased the cecal Escherichia coli population and intestinal Il1b mRNA level. Regardless of the diet type, FCS increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); however, it did not affect body weight, food intake, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, fecal bile acids, and intestinal Il6 mRNA levels. The high-fat diet increased weight gain, hepatic cholesterol and triglycerides, fecal bile acids, and the fecal and cecal Lactobacillus spp. population, and reduced food intake, the fecal E. coli population, and intestinal Il6 mRNA level. The results suggest that FCS consumption exhibits positive health effects in rats fed a high-fat diet by increasing Bifidobacterium spp. population and HDL-C reverse cholesterol transport, and by reducing Il1b mRNA level. However, FCS administration at a dose of 0.39 g/100 g diet over an eight-week period was not effective in controlling food intake, and consequently, preventing weight gain in rats of high-fat diet-induced obesity model.",-1
Assessing temperature-dependent competition between two invasive mosquito species,"Invasive mosquitoes are expanding their ranges into new geographic areas and interacting with resident mosquito species. Understanding how novel interactions can affect mosquito population dynamics is necessary to predict transmission risk at invasion fronts. Mosquito life-history traits are extremely sensitive to temperature, and this can lead to temperature-dependent competition between competing invasive mosquito species. We explored temperature-dependent competition between Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi, two invasive mosquito species whose distributions overlap in India, the Middle East, and North Africa, where An. stephensi is currently expanding into the endemic range of Ae. aegypti. We followed mosquito cohorts raised at different intraspecific and interspecific densities across five temperatures (16-32Â°C) to measure traits relevant for population growth and to estimate species' per capita growth rates. We then used these growth rates to derive each species' competitive ability at each temperature. We find strong evidence for asymmetric competition at all temperatures, with Ae. aegypti emerging as the dominant competitor. This was primarily because of differences in larval survival and development times across all temperatures that resulted in a higher estimated intrinsic growth rate and competitive tolerance estimate for Ae. aegypti compared to An. stephensi. The spread of An. stephensi into the African continent could lead to urban transmission of malaria, an otherwise rural disease, increasing the human population at risk and complicating malaria elimination efforts. Competition has resulted in habitat segregation of other invasive mosquito species, and our results suggest that it may play a role in determining the distribution of An. stephensi across its invasive range.",-1
Speed and safety of mass spectrometry for identification of Burkholderia pseudomallei directly from spiked blood cultures,"Burkholderia pseudomallei is a bipolar Gram-negative bacillus and the causative agent of melioidosis; an infectious disease which commonly presents with bacteraemia. Data regarding direct from blood culture identification of B. pseudomallei using the Vitek mass spectrometer (MS) are limited. The authors aim to assess the safety and sensitivity of the Vitek MS for identification of B. pseudomallei from spiked positive blood culture samples. Safety was assessed by determining the ability of the standard MS Î±-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix solution to inactivate B. pseudomallei. Organism identification using the manufacturer's blood culture extraction method was compared to an in-house technique. Additionally, identification following abbreviated agar incubation of blood culture broth was performed. All 70 MS target spots were inactivated by the matrix solution. The manufacturer's blood culture extraction method identified 0/26 (0%) B. pseudomallei samples. An in-house method using the spun deposit from blood culture broth samples identified 38/38 (100%) B. pseudomallei samples. MS analysis of a blood culture broth drop on Chocolate agar following a 6 h incubation identified 30/32 (94%) samples. Decreased time to diagnosis of melioidosis bacteraemia is likely to improve patient outcomes. This study adds to the literature with regards to the utility of MALDI-TOF MS identification of B. pseudomallei both directly from positive blood culture broth and a subsequent 6 h plate incubation. The use of a standard matrix solution inactivates the organism, and use of the spun deposit from a positive blood culture broth is most effective for early identification of B. pseudomallei.",-1
(Re)claiming plants in comparative psychology,"Up until the middle of the 19th century, some data about plant behavior could be found in books dealing with comparative psychology. The tendency gradually faded away, and the topic was almost exclusively treated in literature dealing with plant physiology. In recent years, however, there has been a revamping of psychological terminology and theorizing to describe, explain, and formulate hypotheses on the evidence that many of the sophisticated behaviors plants exhibit are an expression of cognitive competences that are generally attributed to human and nonhuman animals. In this work I shall discuss a selection of experimental studies supporting the idea that plants could be defined as cognitive agents. Experiments showing that the behavior of plants is controlled by a representation of its goal, episodic-like memory, and decision-making will be described. It is not, however, my intention to embrace any position as to whether or to what degree plants are conscious. Rather, I hope to (re)fuel the discussion within the psychological community that will point in the direction of integrating studies concerning adaptive plant behavior within the wider field of comparative psychology.

Effects of a Home-Based Physical Activity Programme on Blood Biomarkers and Health-Related Quality of Life Indices in Saudi Arabian Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: Protocol for a Randomised Controlled Trial,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is renowned for its high incidence of type-2 diabetes mellitus, with a prevalence rate of around 33%, which is expected to increase to 45.8% by 2030. Engagement in regular physical activity has been shown to significantly attenuate non-communicable diseases including type-2 diabetes. However, the overall rate of physical inactivity among Saudi Arabian adults is currently 80.5%, owing to time pressures, high-density traffic, poor air quality, lack of suitable exercise places/sports facilities, lack of social/friends support, gender, cultural barriers, low self-confidence, lack of time and environmental factors. Previous analyses have shown that home-based activity interventions can be effective. Therefore, given the aforementioned barriers to physical activity in Saudi Arabia; a home-based physical activity may be an ideal solution in type-2 diabetic patients. This manuscript describes the study protocol for a randomized control trial, examining the effects of a home-based physical activity intervention in Saudi Arabian adults with type-2 diabetes. The study will recruit 62 individuals with type-2 diabetes from the Jazan region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who will be individually randomized to either a physical activity or control group. This 24-week investigation will involve 12-weeks of physical activity in the physical activity group and feature three examination points i.e., baseline, 12-weeks and 24-weeks (follow-up). The primary study outcome is the between-group difference in blood HbA1c levels relative to controls. Secondary outcomes measures will be between-group differences in anthropometric, blood lipid, physical fitness, and patient-reported quality of life outcomes pertinent to type-2 diabetes. Statistical analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial has been granted ethical approval by Jazan University, Health Research Ethics Committee (REF: 2177) and formally registered as a trial (NCT04937296). We expect dissemination of the study findings from this investigation to be through publication in a leading peer-reviewed journal.",-1
In Search of Differential Inhibitors of Aldose Reductase,"Aldose reductase, classified within the aldo-keto reductase family as AKR1B1, is an NADPH dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic aldehydes. AKR1B1 is the first enzyme of the so-called polyol pathway that allows the conversion of glucose into sorbitol, which in turn is oxidized to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. The activation of the polyol pathway in hyperglycemic conditions is generally accepted as the event that is responsible for a series of long-term complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, cataract, nephropathy and neuropathy. The role of AKR1B1 in the onset of diabetic complications has made this enzyme the target for the development of molecules capable of inhibiting its activity. Virtually all synthesized compounds have so far failed as drugs for the treatment of diabetic complications. This failure may be partly due to the ability of AKR1B1 to reduce alkenals and alkanals, produced in oxidative stress conditions, thus acting as a detoxifying agent. In recent years we have proposed an alternative approach to the inhibition of AKR1B1, suggesting the possibility of a differential inhibition of the enzyme through molecules able to preferentially inhibit the reduction of either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates. The rationale and examples of this new generation of aldose reductase differential inhibitors (ARDIs) are presented.",-1
Effects of different courses of moxibustion treatment on intestinal flora and inflammation of a rat model of knee osteoarthritis,"Objective:                    This study was done to determine the effects of different courses of moxibustion on a rat knee osteoarthritis (KOA) model, and explore the dose-effect relationship of moxibustion on KOA from the perspectives of intestinal flora and inflammatory factors.              Methods:                    Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: normal, model, moxibustion for 2 weeks, moxibustion for 4 weeks and moxibustion for 6 weeks groups (n = 5 each group). A KOA rat model was induced by monosodium iodoacetate, and moxibustion intervention was performed at the acupoints ""Dubi"" (ST35) and ""Zusanli"" (ST36), once every other day. Pathologic changes in the cartilage of rat knee joints were assessed after intervention, and fecal samples were subjected to 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing for microbial diversity analysis.              Results:                    Damage to the knee articular cartilage was obvious in the model group, which also had increased levels of pro-inflammatory factors, decreased levels of anti-inflammatory factors, and intestinal flora disorders with decreased diversity. The degree of cartilage damage in the 4 and 6 weeks of moxibustion groups was significantly improved compared with the model group. The 4 and 6 weeks of moxibustion groups also demonstrated reduced levels of interleukin-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor-Î± and increased levels of interleukin-10 (P < 0.05). Both the abundance and diversity of the intestinal flora were increased, approaching those of the normal group. Abundances of probiotics Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group and Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 increased, while that of the pathogenic bacteria Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group decreased (P < 0.05). Although the abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group decreased in the 2 weeks of moxibustion group compared with the model group (P < 0.05), there was no statistically significant difference in serum inflammatory factors, flora species diversity or degree of pathological damage compared with the model group.              Conclusion:                    Moxibustion treatment led to significant improvements in the intestinal flora and inflammatory factors of rats with KOA. Moxibustion treatment of 4 and 6 weeks led to better outcomes than the 2-week course. Moxibustion for 4 and 6 weeks can regulate intestinal flora dysfunction with increased probiotics and reduced pathogenic bacteria, reduce pro-inflammatory factors and increase anti-inflammatory factors. No significant differences were seen between the effects of moxibustion for 4 weeks and 6 weeks.",-1
Avenanthramide C induces cellular senescence in colorectal cancer cells via suppressing Î²-catenin-mediated the transcription of miR-183/96/182 cluster,"Cellular senescence is representing a potential anticancer therapeutic arsenal. Avenanthramide C (AVN C), as a signature compound of oats, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-tumor activities. However, the relationship between AVN C and cellular senescence in tumors remains largely unclear. Here, we elucidated that AVN C treatment predisposed colorectal cancer cells to senescent phenotype confirmed by flattened and enlarged shape characteristics, elevated senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase (SA-Î²-Gal) activity, and G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, AVN C triggered cellular senescence via transcriptionally repressing miR-183/96/182 cluster and subsequently reduced the levels of mature miR-183, -96, and -182. Mechanistically, AVN C exerted its senescence induction by attenuating Î²-catenin-mediated transactivation of miR-183/96/182 cluster to unleash its common target FOXO1 and two other targets, FOXO3 and SMAD4, which subsequently foster the p21 and p16 expression. In addition, AVN C is also noted to facilitate p53-mediated p21 transactivation via suppressing Î²-catenin. Collectively, we identified a novel mechanism of Î²-catenin/miR-183/96/182 cluster/FOXO1 mediated-CRC cellular senescence that entails that AVN C serves as an auxiliary agent for CRC treatment.",-1
Application of Correlation Pre-Filtering Neural Network to DNA Methylation Data: Biological Aging Prediction,"We introduce the CPFNN (Correlation Pre-Filtering Neural Network) for biological age prediction based on blood DNA methylation data. The model is built on 20,000 top correlated DNA methylation features and trained by 1810 healthy samples from GEO database. The input data format and the instructions for parser and CPFNN model are detailed in this chapter. Followed by two potential uses, age acceleration detection and unknown age prediction are discussed.",-1
Comparison of visceral fat measurement by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to computed tomography in HIV and non-HIV,"Background/objectives:                    Individuals with HIV are susceptible to visceral fat accumulation, which confers an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Advanced software to ascertain visceral fat content from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has not been validated among this population. We sought to compare DXA with computed tomography (CT) in the measurement of visceral fat cross-sectional area (VAT) in HIV and non-HIV using Bland-Altman analyses.              Subjects/methods:                    Data were combined from five previously conducted studies of individuals with HIV (n = 313) and controls without HIV (n = 144) in which paired DXA and CT scans were available. In cross-sectional analyses, DXA-VAT was compared with CT-VAT among participants with and without HIV. In longitudinal analyses, changes in VAT over time were compared between DXA and CT among participants with and without HIV receiving no intervention over 12 months and among individuals with HIV receiving tesamorelin-a medication known to reduce VAT-over 6 months.              Results:                    In HIV, DXA underestimated VAT compared with CT among individuals with increased visceral adiposity. The measurement bias was -9 Â± 47 cm2 overall, but became progressively larger with greater VAT (P < 0.0001), e.g., -61 Â± 58 cm2 among those with VAT â?200 cm2. Sex-stratified analyses revealed that the relationship between VAT and measurement bias was especially pronounced in men (P < 0.0001). Longitudinally, DXA underestimated changes in VAT, particularly among those at the extremes of VAT gain or loss (P < 0.0001). In contrast to the cross-sectional findings, the tendency for DXA to underestimate longitudinal changes in VAT was evident in both men and women. Analogous findings were seen among controls in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.              Conclusions:                    DXA underestimated VAT relative to CT in men with and without HIV, who had increased visceral adiposity. DXA also underestimated changes in VAT over time in men and women, irrespective of HIV status. DXA-VAT should be used with caution among both HIV and non-HIV-infected populations.",-1
Intranasal Administration of Extracellular Vesicles Mitigates Apoptosis in a Mouse Model of Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury,"Introduction:                    Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) results in significant morbidity and mortality despite current available therapies. Seeking a potential supplemental therapy for HIBI, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of extracellular vesicles derived from neural stem cells (NSC-EVs) and hypoxia-preconditioned brain cells (brain-EVs).              Methods:                    HIBI was induced in postnatal day 9 mice by carotid ligation followed by hypoxia. Following injury, NSC-EVs, brain-EVs, or saline were administered intranasally. Brains were assessed for infarct size, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and caspase-3 expression. Additionally, brain-EV microRNA (miRNA) contents were analyzed by miRNA sequencing.              Results:                    Both EV treated groups showed decreased infarct size (brain-EVs p = 0.004 and NSC-EVs p = 0.052), and although NSC-EV administration resulted in significantly fewer TUNEL+ cells (p = 0.0098), there was no change in caspase-3 expression after NSC-EV administration, suggesting a caspase-3-independent mechanism. Brain-EVs resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in TUNEL+ cells (p = 0.167) but significant decreases in caspase expression (cleaved p = 0.015 and intact p = 0.026). Brain-EVs consistently expressed several miRNAs, including two which have been shown to be downregulated after HIBI: miR-342-3p and miR-330-3p.              Conclusion:                    Understanding the regenerative effects and contents of NSC-EVs and brain-EVs could allow for the development of targeted EV-based therapies that could reduce morbidity and mortality for neonates affected by HIBI.",-1
Multi-Omics Analysis of the Gut-Liver Axis Reveals the Mechanism of Liver Injury in Colitis Mice,"Liver injury is a common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the mechanisms of liver injury development are not clear in IBD patients. Gut microbiota is thought to be engaged in IBD pathogenesis. Here, by an integrated analysis of host transcriptome and colonic microbiome, we have attempted to reveal the mechanism of liver injury in colitis mice. In this study, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced mice colitis model was constructed. Liver transcriptome showed significant up- and down-regulation of pathways linked to immune response and lipid metabolism, respectively. Whilst the colon transcriptome exhibited dramatic alterations in immune response and pathways associated with cell growth and death. The microbiota of DSS-treated mice underwent strong transitions. Correlation analyses identified genes associated with liver and colon injury, whose expression was associated with the abundance of liver and gut health-related bacteria. Collectively, the results indicate that the liver injury in colitis mice may be related to the intestinal dysbiosis and host-microbiota interactions. These findings may provide new insights for identifying potential targets for the treatment of IBD and its induced liver injury.",-1
"Expression level of miR-155, miR-15a and miR-19a in peripheral blood of ductal carcinoma breast cancer patients: Possible bioindicators for cellular inherent radiosensitivity","Examination of cellular radiosensitivity (RS) helps prevent the adverse side-effects of radiotherapy in radioresistant tumors. We aim to study whether miRNA-155 (miR-155), miR-19a and miR-15a can predict inherent RS according to cellular RS in breast cancer (BC) patients. This study was done on the blood samples of 40 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) BC patients and 15 healthy women. G2 assay was performed to evaluate cellular RS. To study the expression level of these miRNAs in blood, qRT-PCR was used. The sensitivity and specificity of the studied miRNAs were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The yield of spontaneous (SY) and radiation-induced (RIY) chromatid breaks (CBs) was significantly different between control and patient groups (p < 0.0001). A cut-off value was specified to recognize the patients with cellular RS from those without. Expression of miR-15a was significantly downregulated (p < 0.0001) in BC patients. However, miR-19a showed upregulation in the blood of BC patients. It was also found the expression level of miR-155 and miR-19a were significantly associated with frequency of CBs (FCB) (p < 0.05). ROC curve analysis manifested that the miR-15a and miR-19a differentiate BC patients and healthy women with 0.91 and 0.68 yielding an area under the ROC curve, respectively. miR-155 and miR-19a discriminate between BC patients with and without cellular RS with area under the ROC curve 0.98 and 0.68. Our findings uncovered miR-155 and miR-19a could be applied as a bioindicator to predict cellular radiosensitivity of BC patients.",-1
Cinnamaldehyde attenuates kidney senescence and injury through PI3K/Akt pathway-mediated autophagy via downregulating miR-155,"Background:                    To prove the internal connection, we deciphered the effect of cinnamaldehyde on kidney senescence through establishing animal and cell models.              Methods:        In vivo, a rat senescence model was constructed using D-galactose (D-gal), and the modeled rats were further treated with cinnamaldehyde. In vitro, rat renal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E) were transfected with miR-155 mimic or inhibitor and then treated with cinnamaldehyde, D-gal or PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). The serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) of the rats were measured by an automatic biochemical analyzer. Pathological changes of kidney were determined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The senescence and viability of NRK-52E cells were assessed by SA-Î²-gal staining and CCK-8 assay, respectively. The levels of miR-155, p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, LC3B (LC3-II and LC3-I) and Beclin1 were detected by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, or western blot.              Results:                    D-gal elevated the levels of BUN, Scr and miR-155 in the kidney, induced the renal pathological damage, inhibited the cell viability, increased the numbers of SA-Î²-gal-, LC3B- and Beclin1-positive cells and upregulated the levels of LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin1 both in the kidney and cells. Cinnamaldehyde reversed D-gal-induced effects on the kidney and cells, and moreover, the cinnamaldehyde-induced anti-D-gal effects on cells could be suppressed by miR-155 mimic but promoted by miR-155 inhibitor. LY294002 potentiated D-gal-induced effects, and reversed cinnamaldehyde- and miR-155 inhibitor-caused impacts on the PI3K/Akt pathway and LC3-II/LC3-I level in D-gal-induced cells.              Conclusion:                    Cinnamaldehyde attenuates kidney senescence and injury through PI3K/Akt pathway-mediated autophagy via downregulating miR-155.",-1
Plasmodium chitinases: revisiting a target of transmission-blockade against malaria,"Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by one of the five species of Plasmodium, among which Plasmodium falciparum cause the deadliest form of the disease. Plasmodium species are dependent on a vertebrate host and a blood-sucking insect vector to complete their life cycle. Plasmodium chitinases belonging to the GH18 family are secreted inside the mosquito midgut, during the ookinete stage of the parasite. Chitinases mediate the penetration of parasite through the peritrophic membrane, facilitating access to the gut epithelial layer. In this review, we describe Plasmodium chitinases with special emphasis on chitinases from P. falciparum and P. vivax, the representative examples of the short and long forms of this protein. In addition to the chitinase domain, chitinases belonging to the long form contain a pro-domain and chitin-binding domain. Amino acid sequence alignment of long and short form chitinase domains reveals multiple positions containing variant residues. A subset of these positions was found to be conserved or invariant within long or short forms, indicating the role of these positions in attributing form-specific activity. The reported differences in affinities to allosamidin for P. vivax and P. falciparum were predicted to be due to different residues at two amino acid positions, resulting in altered interactions with the inhibitor. Understanding the role of these amino acids in Plasmodium chitinases will help us elucidate the mechanism of catalysis and the mode of inhibition, which will be the key for identification of potent inhibitors or antibodies demonstrating transmission-blocking activity.",-1
Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,"There has been exponential growth in the awareness and understanding of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) over the past 3 decades. The clinical features of GI dysfunction in PD have been clearly identified and innovative research has demonstrated the presence of pathology within the enteric nervous system (ENS) in individuals with PD, leading to suggestions that the GI system may be ground zero for the genesis and the portal of entry of PD pathology, which then ascends via the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS). This theory, as well as the more recent recognition of the association of PD with dysbiosis within the gut microbiota, has been the object of intense study and scrutiny. Since most PD medications are absorbed through the GI system, the need for better understanding of changes within the GI tract that may potentially affect the pattern of response to medications has become evident. In this review, current knowledge of the pathophysiology of changes within the GI tract and the gut microbiome of individuals with PD, including changes that occur with progression of the disease, will be addressed. We focus on common clinical GI problems in PD that can arise from different segments of the GI tract. Relevant diagnostic evaluations and treatment options for each of these problems will be reviewed.",-1
"FT-IR characteristics, phenolic profiles and inhibitory potential against digestive enzymes of 25 herbal infusions","The present study aimed to analyse the FT-IR vibrational characteristics and concentration of phenolic compounds in 25 herbal plants using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) techniques, respectively, and to evaluate its in vitro potential to inhibit enzymes related type 2 diabetes and obesity. The vibrational spectra regions-3400-3200 cm-1-indicated hydroxyl group (O-H) and H-bonded stretching, which is characteristic of polyphenolic compounds. A wide range in phenolic compounds was found among the samples. Caffeic acid is the predominant phenolic compounds in the samples. Total phenolic content ranged from 5.02 mg GAE/g DW to 102.39 mg GAE/g DW. A moderate correlation (R2) between antioxidant activity and Î±-amylase inhibition was 0.46, (p < 0.05) while that (R2) of p-coumaric acid and Î±-glucosidase inhibition was 0.54, (p < 0.05). Moreover, the herbal infusions showed potential to inhibit digestive enzymes, the highest being on the infusion based on a cup-serving basis.",-1
Blood steroids are associated with prognosis and fat distribution in endometrial cancer,"Background:                    Despite being a hormone dependent cancer, there is limited knowledge regarding the relation between level of steroids in blood and prognosis for endometrial cancer (EC) patients.              Methods:                    In this study we investigated plasma levels of 19 steroids using liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry in 38 postmenopausal EC patients, 19 with long, and 19 with short survival. We explored if estradiol levels were associated with specific abdominal fat distribution patterns and if transcriptional alterations related to estradiol levels could be observed in tumor samples.              Results:                    The plasma steroid levels for DHEA, DHEAS, progesterone, 21 OH progesterone and E1S were significantly increased (all p < 0.05) in patients with long survival compared to short. Estradiol levels were significantly positively correlated with visceral fat percentage (p = 0.035), and an increased expression of genes involved in estrogen related signaling was observed in tumors from patients with high estradiol levels in plasma.              Conclusion:                    Several of the identified plasma steroids represent promising biomarkers in EC patients. The association between increased estradiol levels and a high percentage of visceral fat indicates that visceral fat is a larger contributor to estradiol production compared to subcutaneous fat in this population.",-1
Fat redistribution and accumulation of visceral adipose tissue predicts type 2 diabetes risk in middle-aged black South African women: a 13-year longitudinal study,"Background:                    Cross-sectional studies in South Africa (SA) have shown that black SA women, despite being more insulin resistant, have less visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and more subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) than white women. This study aimed to investigate whether baseline and/or change in body fat and its distribution predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in middle-aged black SA women, 13 years later.              Methods:                    We studied 142 black SA women who are the caregivers of the Birth-to-Twenty plus cohort, and who had normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at baseline. At baseline and follow-up, fasting blood samples, basic anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition were measured. At follow-up, an oral glucose tolerance test was completed. The WHO diabetes diagnostic criteria were used to define NGT, impaired fasting glucose (IFG)/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) and T2D.              Results:                    At follow-up, 64% of participants remained NGT, whereas 25% developed IGM, and 11% developed T2D. The IGM and the T2D groups were combined for statistical analyses. At baseline, trunk fat mass (FM), VAT but not SAT (measures of central FM) were higher in the IGM/T2D group than the NGT group (p < 0.0001). In contrast, the IGM/T2D group had lower leg %FM at baseline than the NGT group (p < 0.0001). Baseline trunk FM (Odds ratio per 1 kg increase (95% confidence interval, 1.95 (1.43-2.67))), and VAT (OR per 10 cm2 increase, 1.25 (1.10-1.42)), and the change in VAT (1.12 (1.03-1.23)) were associated with greater odds of developing IGM/T2D, whereas baseline leg FM (OR per 1 kg increase, 0.55 (0.41-0.73)) were associated with reduced IGM/T2D risk at follow-up (p < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Relative fat redistribution, with VAT accumulation, predicted the development of IGM/T2D 13 years before its onset. Prevention of central obesity is a key factor to reduce the risk of developing T2D among middle-aged urban black SA women.",-1
Evaluation Algorithm for the Effectiveness of Stroke Rehabilitation Treatment Using Cross-Modal Deep Learning,"It is important to study the evaluation algorithm for the stroke rehabilitation treatment effect to make accurate evaluation and optimize the stroke disease treatment plan according to the evaluation results. To address the problems of poor restoration effect of positron emission tomography (PET) image and recognition restoration effect of evaluation data and so on. In the paper, we propose a stroke rehabilitation treatment effect evaluation algorithm based on cross-modal deep learning. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) and PET of stroke patients were collected as evaluation data to construct a multimodal evaluation dataset, and the data were divided into positive samples and negative samples. According to the mapping relationship between MRI and PET, three-dimensional cyclic adversarial is used to generate the neural network model to recover the missing PET data. Using the cross-modal depth learning network model, the RGB image, depth image, gray image, and normal images of MRI and PET are taken as the feature images and the multifeature fusion method is used to fuse the feature images, output the recognition results of MRI and PET, and evaluate the effect of stroke rehabilitation treatment according to the recognition results. The results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately restore PET images, the evaluation data recognition effect is good, and the evaluation data recognition accuracy is higher than 95%. The evaluation accuracy of stroke rehabilitation treatment effect is high, the evaluation time varies between 0.56 s and 0.91 s, and the practical application effect is good.",-1
NKG2C+ NK Cells for Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma Multiforme,"In glioblastoma, non-classical human leucocyte antigen E (HLA-E) and HLA-G are frequently overexpressed. HLA-E loaded with peptides derived from HLA class I and from HLA-G contributes to inhibition of natural killer (NK) cells with expression of the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A. We investigated whether NK cells expressing the activating CD94/NKG2C receptor counterpart were able to exert anti-glioma effects. NKG2C+ subsets were preferentially expanded by a feeder cell line engineered to express an artificial disulfide-stabilized trimeric HLA-E ligand (HLA-E*spG). NK cells expanded by a feeder cell line, which facilitates outgrowth of conventional NKG2A+, and fresh NK cells, were included for comparison. Expansion via the HLA-E*spG feeder cells selectively increased the fraction of NKG2C+ NK cells, which displayed a higher frequency of KIR2DL2/L3/S2 and CD16 when compared to expanded NKG2A+ NK cells. NKG2C+ NK cells exhibited increased cytotoxicity against K562 and KIR:HLA-matched and -mismatched primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells when compared to NKG2A+ NK cells and corresponding fresh NK cells. Cytotoxic responses of NKG2C+ NK cells were even more pronounced when utilizing target cells engineered with HLA-E*spG. These findings support the notion that NKG2C+ NK cells have potential therapeutic value for treating gliomas.",-1
"Effects of magnitude of visceral adipose tissue reduction: Impact on insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia and cardiometabolic risk in adolescents with obesity after long-term weight-loss therapy","Aim:                    To investigate the association between visceral adipose tissue loss and insulin resistance and hyperleptinemia in adolescents with obesity submitted to interdisciplinary weight-loss therapy.              Methods:                    A total of 172 post-pubertal adolescents (body mass index greater than the 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reference growth charts) were recruited for the study. The adolescents were assigned to long-term weight-loss therapy. Body composition, visceral and subcutaneous fat, glucose metabolism, lipid profile, hepatic enzymes and leptin concentration were measured. After the therapy, the adolescents were allocated to three different groups according to the tertile of visceral fat reduction.              Results:                    Positive effects on body composition were observed in all analysed groups independent of visceral fat reduction. It was found that visceral fat was an independent predictor of insulin resistance in the investigated population. Obese adolescents who lost a higher proportion of visceral adipose tissue (>1.8 cm) demonstrated improved metabolic and inflammatory parameters twice as much than those who presented smaller losses. Positive correlations between visceral fat reduction and glucose metabolism, lipid profile, hepatic enzymes and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index were demonstrated.              Conclusion:                    The magnitude of the reduction in visceral fat was an independent predictor of insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia and metabolic disorders related to obese adolescents.",-1
Baicalin confers hepatoprotective effect against alcohol-associated liver disease by upregulating microRNA-205,"Recently, baicalin refers to flavonoid compound extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi has been indicated to hold promising therapeutic effects in alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). However, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms for its hepatoprotective effect is still very limited. Evidence exists suggesting potential association between miR-205 and baicalin's function. Bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase reporter assay were conducted to determine the binding affinity between miR-205 and importinÎ±5. Our findings revealed that baicalin could alleviate ALD by raising the expression of miR-205. Additionally, miR-205 repressed NF-ÎºB signaling pathway activation by binding to importinÎ±5 to relieve ALD. Baicalin inhibited importinÎ±5-mediated NF-ÎºB signaling pathway to protect the liver against alcohol-induced injury, inflammation, oxidative stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. Taken conjointly, baicalin confers hepatoprotective effect against ALD through miR-205-mediated importinÎ±5 inhibition via the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, highlighting a promising therapeutic target for ALD treatment with the help of traditional Chinese medicine.",-1
Oxidative Damage in Sporadic Colorectal Cancer: Molecular Mapping of Base Excision Repair Glycosylases MUTYH and hOGG1 in Colorectal Cancer Patients,"Oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage and resulting mutations play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Impaired equilibrium between DNA damage formation, antioxidant status, and DNA repair capacity is responsible for the accumulation of genetic mutations and genomic instability. The lesion-specific DNA glycosylases, e.g., hOGG1 and MUTYH, initiate the repair of oxidative DNA damage. Hereditary syndromes (MUTYH-associated polyposis, NTHL1-associated tumor syndrome) with germline mutations causing a loss-of-function in base excision repair glycosylases, serve as straight forward evidence on the role of oxidative DNA damage and its repair. Altered or inhibited function of above glycosylases result in an accumulation of oxidative DNA damage and contribute to the adenoma-adenocarcinoma transition. Oxidative DNA damage, unless repaired, often gives rise G:C &gt; T:A mutations in tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes with subsequent occurrence of chromosomal copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. For instance, G&gt;T transversions in position c.34 of a KRAS gene serves as a pre-screening tool for MUTYH-associated polyposis diagnosis. Since sporadic colorectal cancer represents more complex and heterogenous disease, the situation is more complicated. In the present study we focused on the roles of base excision repair glycosylases (hOGG1, MUTYH) in colorectal cancer patients by investigating tumor and adjacent mucosa tissues. Although we found downregulation of both glycosylases and significantly lower expression of hOGG1 in tumor tissues, accompanied with G&gt;T mutations in KRAS gene, oxidative DNA damage and its repair cannot solely explain the onset of sporadic colorectal cancer. In this respect, other factors (especially microenvironment) per se or in combination with oxidative DNA damage warrant further attention. Base excision repair characteristics determined in colorectal cancer tissues and their association with disease prognosis have been discussed as well.",-1
"Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ316 improves the quality of Stachys sieboldii Miq. pickle by inhibiting harmful bacteria growth, degrading nitrite and promoting the gut microbiota health in vitro","Microbial contamination and nitrite accumulation are the two major concerns in the quality control of fermented vegetables. In the present study, a lactic acid bacteria strain Lactobacillus plantarum ZJ316 (ZJ316) was inoculated during Stachys sieboldii Miq. (SSM) fermentation, and the effects of ZJ316 on the quality and bacterial community of SSM during fermentation were investigated. It was observed that ZJ316 could avoid the occurrence of the nitrite peak and maintain the nitrite content of fermented SSM at a low level. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) results suggested that ZJ316 gave good flavor to the fermented SSM. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that Firmicutes was the dominant flora after ZJ316 inoculation, and the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased at the same time. At the level of the genus, SSM fermented by ZJ316 had a more obvious inhibitory effect on Pseudomonas on the 7th day compared with the naturally fermented SSM. Additionally, the effect of ZJ316-fermented SSM on gut microbiota modulation was also evaluated using an in vitro fecal fermentation system. The results revealed that ZJ316 had a relatively subtle influence on intestinal communities with a potentially positive impact on probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and a negative impact on Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, SSM fermented by ZJ316 promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the human intestine. These results demonstrate that L. plantarum ZJ316 can be used as a good starter in the fermentation process of pickles.",-1
Clinical Validation of the Fully Automated NeuMoDx HPV Assay for Cervical Cancer Screening,"The NeuMoDx HPV assay is a novel fully automated, real-time PCR-based assay for the qualitative detection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical specimens. The assay specifically identifies HPV16 and HPV18 and concurrently detects 13 other high-risk HPV types at clinically relevant infection levels. Following the international guidelines, the clinical performance of the NeuMoDx HPV assay for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) against the reference standard Hybrid Capture 2, as well as intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility were assessed on PreservCyt samples. The clinical accuracy of the assay was additionally evaluated against the clinically validated Alinity m HR HPV and COBAS 4800 HPV Test on PreservCyt samples, and against the clinically validated HPV-Risk assay on SurePath samples. The NeuMoDx HPV assay performance for CIN2+ was non-inferior to the reference methods on both sample types (all p &lt; 0.05), and showed excellent intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility (95.7%; 95% CI: 93.9-97.3; kappa value 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86-0.94); and 94.5%; 95% CI: 92.6-96.2; kappa value 0.87 (95% CI: 0.82-0.92), respectively). In conclusion, the NeuMoDx HPV assay meets international guideline criteria for cross-sectional accuracy and reproducibility, and performs equally well on cervical screening specimens collected in two widely used collection media. The NeuMoDx HPV assay fulfils the requirements to be used for primary cervical screening.",-1
Intermittent Fasting Attenuates Exercise Training-Induced Cardiac Remodeling,"Background:                    The effects of non-pharmacological interventions such as calorie restriction and exercise training on health and prevention of cardiovascular diseases have been investigated in clinical and experimental studies.              Objective:                    To analyze the influence of intermittent fasting and exercise training on functional fitness, glycemia and cardiac remodeling.              Methods:                    Wistar rats (n=60) were randomly divided into four groups: control, exercise training (ET), intermittent fasting (IF) and exercise training plus intermittent fasting (ETI). Over 12 weeks, control and ET animals were fed daily a standard commercial diet ad libitum , while IF and ETI animals were fed every other day. In addition, the ET and ETI groups were submitted to a running protocol on a treadmill. After this period, functional fitness, nutritional parameters and blood glucose levels were analyzed. In addition to heart morphology, myocardial protein expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was assessed by Western-blot. The results were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test. The level of significance considered was 5%.              Results:                    Exercise training increased functional fitness in the ET and ETI groups and promoted cardiac fibrosis. The combination of intermittent fasting and exercise training resulted in a smaller area under the blood glucose curve and reduced cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and interstitial collagen fraction in the ETI group compared to ET. ERK and JNK expression levels were similar among groups (p>0.05).              Conclusions:                    Intermittent fasting is associated with improved glucose tolerance and attenuates cardiac remodeling induced by exercise training (Arq Bras Cardiol. 2020; 115(2):184-193).",-1
Fabry disease - a multisystemic disease with gastrointestinal manifestations,"Nonspecific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as postprandial cramping pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are typical symptoms for irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, but may also be the first symptoms of Fabry disease (FD). This review focus on GI manifestations in FD, by providing an overview of symptoms, a proper diagnosis, an appropriate management by FD-specific and concomitant medications and lifestyle interventions. We provide comprehensive literature-based data combined with personal experience in the management of FD patients. Since FD is rare and the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous, affected patients are often misdiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should consider FD as a possible differential diagnosis when assessing unspecific GI symptoms. Improved diagnostic tools, such as a modified GI symptom assessment scale can facilitate the diagnosis of FD in patients with GI symptoms of unknown cause and thus enable the timely initiation of a disease-specific therapy. Expansive intravenous enzyme replacement therapy with Î±-galactosidase A or oral chaperone therapy for patients with amenable mutations improve the disease burden including GI symptoms, but a timely start of therapy is crucial for the prognosis. A special diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) or pro- and prebiotics might improve FD-typical GI symptoms. Furthermore, preliminary success was reported with the oral administration of Î±-galactosidase A. In addition to a timely initiation of FD-specific therapy, affected patients with GI symptoms might benefit from a FODMAP-low diet, pro- and prebiotics and/or low-cost oral substitution with AGAL to support digestion and reduce dysbiosis.",-1
Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder: Abnormal Cardiac Image and Progressive Abnormal Metabolic Brain Pattern,"Background:                    Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is prodromal for Î±-synucleinopathies.              Objective:                    The aim of this study was to determine whether pathological cardiac [123 I]meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy ([123 I]MIBG) is associated with progression of [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography-based Parkinson's disease (PD)-related brain pattern (PDRP) expression in iRBD.              Methods:                    Seventeen subjects with iRBD underwent [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography brain imaging twice ~3.6 years apart. In addition, [123 I]MIBG and [123 I]N-Ï-fluoropropyl-2Î²-carbomethoxy-3Î²-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane single-photon emission computed tomography ([123 I]FP-CIT-SPECT) at baseline were performed. Olfactory, cognitive, and motor functions were tested annually.              Results:                    Twelve of 17 subjects had pathological [123 I]MIBG. At baseline, 6 of 12 of these expressed the PDRP (suprathreshold PDRP z score). At follow-up, 12 of 17 subjects had suprathreshold PDRP z scores, associated with pathological [123 I]MIBG in 92% and with pathological [123 I]FP-CIT-SPECT in 75%. Subjects with pathological [123 I]MIBG had higher PDRP z score change per year (P = 0.027). Three subjects phenoconverted to PD; all had pathological [123 I]MIBG and [123 I]FP-CIT-SPECT, suprathreshold baseline PDRP z scores, and hyposmia.              Conclusions:                    Pathological [123 I]MIBG was associated with progressive and suprathreshold PDRP z scores at follow-up. Abnormal [123 I]MIBG likely identifies iRBD as prodromal PD earlier than pathological [123 I]FP-CIT-SPECT. Â© 2021 The Authors.

"Effects of Plant Substrate, Insecticide, and Blood Meal Status on the Efficacy of Barrier Treatments Against Aedes albopictus","The effects of 3 plant species (Cornus florida [dogwood], rhododendron X 'Chionoides' [rhododendron], and Ilex opaca [American holly]), 4 insecticide treatments (DemandÂ® CS [lambda-cyhalothrin] at 6.25 ml[AI]/liter; TalstarÂ® Professional [bifenthrin] at 7.81 ml[AI]/liter, and SuspendÂ® PolyzoneÂ® [deltamethrin] at 11.72 ml[AI]/liter, and water), and 2 physiological states (blood-fed and unfed) were evaluated for knockdown (1 h) and mortality (24 h) against female Aedes albopictus over an 8-wk sampling period. Analyses determined that there was a significant interaction between the tested plant species and the insecticides evaluated. Significant differences were likewise observed between the insecticide treatments for unfed Ae. albopictus females, with Demand CS demonstrating the highest knockdown and mortality rates (from >90% to >10% at wk 8 and >95% to â?0% at wk 8, respectively), followed by Talstar Professional (from >75% to <10% at wk 2 and >90% to <10% at wk 2, respectively) and Suspend Polyzone (from >20% to <10% at wk 8 and >25% to >50% at wk 8, respectively). All treatments were no longer significant for knockdown or mortality at the end of the 8-wk timeframe. Significant differences were also observed between insecticide treatments for blood-fed Ae. albopictus females; Demand CS showed high knockdown and mortality rates (from 100% to â?0% at wk 8 and 100% to >60% at wk 8, respectively), Suspend Polyzone rates were similar to Demand CS (from >80% to â?0% at wk 8 and â?0% to >65% at wk 8, respectively), and both were followed by Talstar Professional (from 100% to <10% at wk 4 and 100% to <20% at wk 4, respectively). All tested pyrethroid sprays showed a significant increase in effectiveness against recently blood-fed Ae. albopictus females, as compared to the unfed females. These results suggest that Demand CS can be used as an effective barrier spray against Ae. albopictus adults due to the limited impact of target foliage, its long-term efficacy under environmental conditions, and its continued effectiveness regardless of the blood meal status of the target mosquito.",-1
The Impact of Corporate Capital Structure on Financial Performance Based on Convolutional Neural Network,"Capital structure is an important indicator to measure the source, composition, and proportion of a company's equity and debit capital. It is not only related to the internal operating environment of listed companies but also related to the rights and obligations of shareholders and is closely related to the company's future development direction, decision-making bodies, and changes in governance structure. This study aims to study the impact of corporate capital structure on financial performance based on convolutional neural network. Based on the relevant theories of capital structure, by constructing a convolutional neural network model, taking a listed company as the research object, this study analyzes the company's capital structure, liabilities, and other financial conditions. Finally, it is concluded that short-term liabilities can meet the company's sustainable development and enhance the competitiveness of the industry, thereby increasing the company's operating income. However, a poor capital structure can negatively impact a company's finances. By improving the corporate governance structure of listed companies, strengthening the adjustment of the financing structure of listed companies, and strengthening the management of listed company's operating risks, the company's capital structure can be improved so that the company's financial situation can be sustainable and healthy.",-1
Comparative Analysis of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Different Parts of Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt,"Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt., a medicinal herb and edible plant, is very popular among East Asian countries. The perilla leaves, stems and seeds can be used as traditional medicines and foods. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and halogenated PAHs (HPAHs) are organic pollutants that are widely present in the environment, such as in water, air and soil, and are harmful to humans. In this study, the contents of 16 PAHs and 4 HPAHs in perilla leaves, stems and seeds were determined by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 12 PAHs were detected in all samples, and no HPAHs were detected. The total contents of PAHs in perilla leaves, stems and seeds varied from 41.93 to 415.60 ng/g, 7.02 to 51.52 ng/g and 15.24 to 180.00 ng/g, respectively. The statistical analyses showed that there were significant differences in the distribution of PAHs in perilla leaves, stems and seeds. On the basis of the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) model, the cancer risks of the intake of perilla leaves, stems and seeds were assessed to be from 3.30 Ã 10-8 to 2.11 Ã 10-5, 5.52 Ã 10-9 to 5.50 Ã 10-8 and 1.20 Ã 10-8 to 1.41 Ã 10-7, respectively. These were lower than 10-4 (the priority risk level of the EPA) and suggested that there may be almost no cancer risk from the intake of these traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs).",-1
Arylquin 1 (Potent Par-4 Secretagogue) Inhibits Tumor Progression and Induces Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal cancers worldwide. Current therapeutic strategies mainly involve surgery and chemoradiotherapy; however, novel antitumor compounds are needed to avoid drug resistance in CRC, as well as the severe side effects of current treatments. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects and underlying mechanisms of Arylquin 1 in CRC. The MTT assay was used to detect the viability of SW620 and HCT116 cancer cells treated with Arylquin 1 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Further, wound-healing and transwell migration assays were used to evaluate the migration and invasion abilities of cultured cells, and Annexin V was used to detect apoptotic cells. Additionally, Western blot was used to identify the expression levels of N-cadherin, caspase-3, cyclin D1, p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p-c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), and phospho-p38, related to key signaling proteins, after administration of Arylquin 1. Xenograft experiments further confirmed the effects of Arylquin 1 on CRC cells in vivo. Arylquin 1 exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability in cultured CRC cells. It also inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induced apoptosis. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that Arylquin 1 increased phosphorylation levels of ERK, JNK, and p38. In a mouse xenograft model, Arylquin 1 treatment diminished the growth of colon tumors after injection of cultured cancer cells. Arylquin 1 may have potential anticancer effects and translational significance in the treatment of CRC.",-1
1-Kestose supplementation mitigates the progressive deterioration of glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes OLETF rats,"The fructooligosaccharide 1-kestose cannot be hydrolyzed by gastrointestinal enzymes, and is instead fermented by the gut microbiota. Previous studies suggest that 1-kestose promotes increases in butyrate concentrations in vitro and in the ceca of rats. Low levels of butyrate-producing microbiota are frequently observed in the gut of patients and experimental animals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, little is known about the role of 1-kestose in increasing the butyrate-producing microbiota and improving the metabolic conditions in type 2 diabetic animals. Here, we demonstrate that supplementation with 1-kestose suppressed the development of diabetes in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, possibly through improved glucose tolerance. We showed that the cecal contents of rats fed 1-kestose were high in butyrate and harbored a higher proportion of the butyrate-producing genus Anaerostipes compared to rats fed a control diet. These findings illustrate how 1-kestose modifications to the gut microbiota impact glucose metabolism of T2D, and provide a potential preventative strategy to control glucose metabolism associated with dysregulated insulin secretion.",-1
Psychosocial factors and hospitalisations for COVID-19: Prospective cohort study based on a community sample,"Background:                    While certain infectious diseases have been linked to socioeconomic disadvantage, mental health problems, and lower cognitive function, relationships with COVID-19 are either uncertain or untested. Our objective was to examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19.              Methods:                    UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40-69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Hospitalisations for COVID-19 were ascertained between 16th March and 26th April 2020.              Results:                    There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 England-based study members. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function - verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend â?0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85).              Conclusions:                    A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisation for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function, a marker of health literacy, was most robust.",-1
Obesity alters oestrogen metabolism and contributes to pulmonary arterial hypertension,"Obesity is a common comorbidity for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Additionally, oestrogen and its metabolites are risk factors for the development of PAH. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a major site of oestrogen production; however, the influence of obesity-induced changes in oestrogen synthesis and metabolism on the development of PAH is unclear. To address this we investigated the effects of inhibiting oestrogen synthesis and metabolism on the development of pulmonary hypertension in male and female obese mice.We depleted endogenous oestrogen in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice with the oestrogen inhibitor anastrozole (ANA) and determined the effects on the development of pulmonary hypertension, plasma oestradiol and urinary 16Î±-hydroxyestrone (16Î±OHE1). Oestrogen metabolism through cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) was inhibited with 2,2',4,6'-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS).ob/ob mice spontaneously develop pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary vascular remodelling and increased reactive oxygen species production in the lung; these effects were attenuated by ANA. Oestradiol levels were decreased in obese male mice; however, VAT CYP1B1 and 16Î±OHE1 levels were increased. TMS also attenuated pulmonary hypertension in male ob/ob mice. Intra-thoracic fat from ob/ob mice and VAT conditioned media produce 16Î±OHE1 and can contribute to oxidative stress, effects that are attenuated by both ANA and TMS.Obesity can induce pulmonary hypertension and changes in oestrogen metabolism, resulting in increased production of 16Î±OHE1 from VAT that contributes to oxidative stress.

This study has translational consequences as it suggests that oestrogen inhibitors may be especially beneficial in treating obese individuals with PAH.",-1
MicroRNA-20a elevates osteogenic/odontoblastic differentiation potential of dental pulp stem cells by nuclear factor-ÎºB/p65 signaling pathway via targeting interleukin-8,"Objective:                    In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanism underlying microRNA-20a (miR-20a) in viability, migration and osteogenic/odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs).              Design:                    The results of Targetscan unveiled that interleukin (IL)- 8 might bind to miR-20a, which was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. MiR-20a expression was up-regulated or down-regulated in DPSCs, followed by measurement of cell viability and migration via MTT and wound healing assays. Then, IL-8 was over-expressed in miR-20a mimic-transfected DPSCs with or without nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB inhibitor. The effect of miR-20a on osteogenic/odontoblastic differentiation potential of DPSCs was determined by alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red S staining. The expression levels of IL-8, osteogenic differentiation indicators and NF-ÎºB/p65 signaling pathway in cells were detected through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) or western blot RESULTS: Contrary to the down-regulated miR-20a, up-regulated miR-20a not only reinforced the viability and migration of DPSCs, but also promoted cell osteogenic/odontoblastic differentiation potential and related gene expressions (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP)). Furthermore, IL-8 was verified to be the target of miR-20a. IL-8 over-expression effectively suppressed the osteogenic/odontoblastic differentiation potential as well as inhibited the activation of NF-ÎºB pathway in DPSCs induced by miR-20a mimic, but these effects could be counteracted by NF-ÎºB inhibitor.              Conclusion:                    MiR-20a up-regulation accelerated the viability, migration and osteogenic/odontoblastic differentiation potential of DPSCs by regulating NF-ÎºB/p65 signaling pathway via targeting IL-8, which might be a potential treatment target for dental diseases.",-1
Multiple insecticide resistance and associated mechanisms to volatile pyrethroid in an Aedes albopictus population collected in southern China,"Conventional and volatile pyrethroids are widely used to control the vectors of dengue arboviral diseases, Aedes albopictus in China. The development of resistance to conventional pyrethroids has become an increasing problem, potentially affecting the use of volatile pyrethroid. The Ae. albopictus dimefluthrin-resistant (R) strain by selecting the field population with dimefluthrin were investigated the multiple and cross-resistance levels between conventional and volatile pyrethroids and analyzed both target-site and metabolic resistant mechanisms to dimefluthrin compared with three volatile pyrethroids metofluthrin, meperfluthrin and esbiothrin and type II pyrethroid deltamethrin. The R strain displayed moderate to low resistance to selected pyrethroids (dimefluthrin, metofluthrin, meperfluthrin, esbiothrin and deltamethrin) associated with metabolic enzymes, but less distinctly to selected pyrethroids (dimefluthrin and metofluthrin) associated with a high frequency of sodium channel gene mutation (F1534S). Profiles of the multiple and cross-resistance of the R strain to other three volatile pyrethroids and type II pyrethroid deltamethrin were detected. Both synergistic and enzyme activity studies indicated that multifunctional oxidase (MFO) played an important role in this resistance.",-1
Treadmill exercise improve recognition memory by TREM2 pathway to inhibit hippocampal microglial activation and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease model,"Alzheimer's disease-related cognition impairment is correlated with increased neuroinflammation. Studies show that physical exercises improve cognitive function and regulate neuroinflammation. However, no sufficient studies have been performed to directly observe the mechanism of exercise-related effects on microglia and neuroinflammation, in association with memory function under Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to explore the relationship of TREM2, microglia activation and neuroinflammation in the development of Alzheimer's disease, followed by investigating why physical exercises improve cognition in the Alzheimer's disease model by means of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection. We found that: 1) Recognition memory impairment in AÎ²-induced Alzheimer's disease model was associated with the reduction in TREM2 which induced microglial activation and neuroinflammation; 2) Exercise activated the TREM2 pathway, which was necessary for inhibiting microglial activation and neuroinflammation, leading to improved recognition memory in the Alzheimer's disease model. Together, the improvement of AD-associated recognition memory by exercises is associated with up-regulation of the TREM2 pathway which promotes the phenotypic conversion of microglia and decreases the level of neuroinflammation.",-1
Simultaneous Intake of Euglena gracilis and Vegetables Exerts Synergistic Anti-Obesity and Anti-Inflammatory Effects by Modulating the Gut Microbiota in Diet-Induced Obese Mice,"We determined whether the anti-obesity effect provided by the consumption of Euglena gracilis (Euglena), which is rich in insoluble dietary fiber, could be enhanced by the co-consumption of vegetables with an abundance of soluble dietary fiber. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups as follows: group 1 received a normal diet, group 2 received a high-fat diet, and groups 3, 4, and 5 received high fat diets containing 0.3% paramylon, 1.0% Euglena, or 1.0% Euglena plus 0.3% vegetables (barley leaf, kale, and ashitaba), respectively. Mice were fed ad libitum until 18 weeks of age. Euglena intake significantly reduced visceral fat accumulation in obese mice, and co-consumption of vegetables enhanced this effect. Consumption of Euglena with vegetables reduced adipocyte area, suppressed the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis, upregulated genes related to adipocyte lipolysis, and suppressed serum markers of inflammation. Notably, we also observed an increase in the fraction of short-chain fatty acid-producing beneficial bacteria, a reduction in harmful bacteria that cause inflammation, and an increase in short-chain fatty acid production. Therefore, the co-consumption of vegetables enhanced the anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory effects of Euglena, likely by modulating the gut microbiota composition.",-1
Porphyrin NanoMetal-Organic Frameworks as Cancer Theranostic Agents,"Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid multifunctional platforms that have found remarkable applications in cancer treatment and diagnostics. Independently, these materials can be employed in cancer treatment as intelligent drug carriers in chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, and photodynamic therapy; conversely, MOFs can further be used as diagnostic tools in fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography imaging, and photoacoustic imaging. One essential property of these materials is their great ability to fine-tune their composition toward a specific application by way of a judicious choice of the starting building materials (metal nodes and organic ligands). Moreover, many advancements were made concerning the preparation of these materials, including the ability to downsize the crystallites yielding nanoporous porphyrin MOFs (NMOFs) which are of great interest for clinical treatment and diagnostic theranostic tools. The usage of porphyrins as ligands allows a high degree of multifunctionality. Historically these molecules are well known for their reactive oxygen species formation and strong fluorescence characteristics, and both have proved helpful in cancer treatment and diagnostic tools. The anticipation that porphyrins in MOFs could prompt the resulting materials to multifunctional theranostic platforms is a reality nowadays with a series of remarkable and ground-breaking reports available in the literature. This is particularly remarkable in the last five years, when the scientific community witnessed rapid development in porphyrin MOFs theranostic agents through the development of imaging technologies and treatment strategies for cancer. This manuscript reviews the most relevant recent results and achievements in this particular area of interest in MOF chemistry and application.",-1
Dynamic of TLQP-peptides upon fasting,"Background:                    The VGF-derived TLQP peptides (TLQPp), a new potential drug target for obesity, are expressed in stomach, pancreas, adrenal gland as well as in adipose tissues, and, when exogenously injected, regulate energy expenditure and food intake. However, it is not clear if these peptides physiologically change in these organs in response to fasting.              Methods:                    Rats were subdivided into four groups: (A) fed ad libitum, (B) fed with restrictions (once a day) (C) fast for 48 h and (D) fast for 48 h and then fed 1 h before sacrifice. Immunosorbent assay was used to possibly reveal TLQPp changes upon fasting in plasma as well as in pancreas, adrenal gland, stomach and adipose tissues. In the latter organs, we also measured the levels of the VGF precursor protein while immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the presence of the TLQP-21 receptors.              Results:                    During fasting, TLQPp were down-regulated in the stomach (45 %), pancreas (47 %), adrenal gland (51 %) and WAT (45.2 %) in parallel with a significant increase in the blood (36.6 %), all versus ad libitum group. In the same organs where the TLQPp were decreased upon fasting, the VGF precursor levels were not changed. In ad libitum rats, TLQP-21 receptors were well represented within the same cells that expressed TLQPp, suggesting an autocrine activity to be better investigated.              Conclusions:                    During fasting, TLQPp are probably produced and immediately secreted into the blood circulation, until the hypoglycaemia is counteracted.",-1
microRNA-150 targets major epigenetic repressors and inhibits cell proliferation,"The Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) proteins, EZH2 and EZH1 regulate many biological processes by generating the repressive H3K27me3 modifications in the chromatin. However, the factors that regulate the EZH1/EZH2 functions are poorly studied. We identify that the 3'UTRs of EZH2 and EZH1 mRNAs contain the binding sites for the miRNA, miR-150. MicroRNA-150 (miR-150) controls numerous biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer. We find that miR-150 regulates the levels of EZH1 and EZH2 through various experimental investigations. Since EZH2 is known to form a repressive complex with other epigenetic repressors especially DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we investigated whether miR-150 also regulates the DNMT3A and DNMT3B levels. We report that miR-150 regulates DNMT3A and DNMT3B levels through direct and indirect mechanisms respectively. Since these epigenetic repressors promote cell proliferation, we investigated the effect of miR-150 perturbation on HEK293 cell proliferation. We found that miR-150 inhibits cell proliferation and induces S-phase arrest by increasing the levels of tumor suppressors and decreasing the cell cycle regulators. Collectively, our study shows that miR-150 act as a tumor suppressor by down-regulating the oncogenic major epigenetic repressors and controls cell proliferation.",-1
SNPs in Genes Related to DNA Damage Repair in Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Their Association with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Drug Resistance,"Genes related to DNA damage repair in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are critical for survival and genomic diversification. The aim of this study is to compare the presence of SNPs in genes related to DNA damage repair in sensitive and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis genomes isolated from patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We collected 399 M. tuberculosis L4 genomes from several public repositories; 224 genomes belonging to hosts without T2DM, of which 123 (54.9%) had drug sensitive tuberculosis (TB) and 101 (45.1%) had drug resistance (DR)-TB; and 175 genomes from individuals with T2DM, of which 100 (57.1%) had drug sensitive TB and 75 (42.9%) had DR-TB. The presence of SNPs in the coding regions of 65 genes related to DNA damage repair was analyzed and compared with the resistance profile and the presence/absence of T2DM in the host. The results show the phylogenetic relationships of some SNPS and L4 sub-lineages, as well as differences in the distribution of SNPs present in DNA damage repair-related genes related to the resistance profile of the infecting strain and the presence of T2DM in the host. Given these differences, it was possible to generate two discriminant functions to distinguish between drug sensitive and drug resistant genomes, as well as patients with or without T2DM.",-1
Stimulated UCPCR Levels Are Lower in People With Type 1 Diabetes Than in Other Diabetes Types in Sub-Saharan Africa: Results From a Preliminary Cross-Sectional Study,"Background:                    The clinical utility of Urinary C-Peptide to Creatinine Ratio (UCPCR) is well understood in people with different types of diabetes in Caucasian populations, but studies are lacking in African populations. We, therefore, aimed to examine Urinary C-Peptide to Creatinine Ratio levels among groups of people with different types of diabetes in a sub-Saharan African population.              Methods:                    A total of 47 adults with diabetes; 10 with type 1 diabetes, 26 with type 2 diabetes, 11 with ketosis-prone diabetes, and 22 healthy control individuals, were recruited from YaoundÃ© Central Hospital in Cameroon. Fasting blood glucose and C-peptide were measured in venous blood and urine. Stimulated Urinary C-Peptide to Creatinine Ratio was determined in all subjects after ingestion of a standardized mixed meal. We compared the stimulated Urinary C-peptide to Creatinine Ration concentration in subjects with type 1 diabetes to the other groups.              Results:                    The basal C-peptide and HOMA-Î² were lower in T1D than in the T2D group [median 57 (34, 69) vs. 398 (335, 502) pmol/l; p â?0.001] and [median 3.0 (1.63, 5.25) vs. 30.6 (17.94, 45.03); p < 0.001] respectively. Also, basal C-peptide and HOMA-Î² were lower in T1D than in those with KPD [median 57 (34, 69) vs. 330 (265, 478) pmol/l; p = 0.003] and [median 3.0 (1.63, 5.25) vs. 47.1 (16.2, 63.1), p = 0.001] respectively. Basal C-peptide was not different between participants with T2D and KPD; 398 (335, 502) vs. 330 (265, 478) pmol/l, p = 0.19. Stimulated UCPCR was lower in T1D compared to T2D, KPD and control participants; [median 0.29 (0.14, 0.68) vs. 0.89 (0.40, 1.69) nmol/moll; p = 0.009], [median 0.29 (0.14, 0.68) vs. 1.33 (0.84, 1.59) nmol/mol; p = 0.006] and [median 0.29 (0.14, 0.68) vs. 1.21 (0.85, 1.21) nmol/mol; p = 0.005] respectively. However, stimulated UCPCR was similar between the T2D and KPD study participants; 0.89 (0.40, 1.69) vs. 1.33 (0.84, 1.59) nmol/mol, p = 0.36.              Conclusions:                    Stimulated Urinary C-Peptide to Creatinine Ratio (UCPCR) is lower in participants with type 1 diabetes compared to those with other types of diabetes in this population. This means stimulated UCPCR could potentially differentiate type 1 diabetes from other diabetes types among people with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.",-1
Intestinal toxicity of micro- and nano-particles of foodborne titanium dioxide in juvenile mice: Disorders of gut microbiota-host co-metabolites and intestinal barrier damage,"The wide use of TiO2 particles in food and the high exposure risk to children have prompted research into the health risks of TiO2. We used the microbiome and targeted metabolomics to explore the potential mechanism of intestinal toxicity of foodborne TiO2 micro-/nanoparticles after oral exposure for 28 days in juvenile mice. Results showed that the gut microbiota-including the abundance of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella-changed dynamically during exposure. The organic inflammatory response was activated, and lipopolysaccharide levels increased. Intestinal toxicity manifested as increased mucosal permeability, impaired intestinal barrier, immune damage, and pathological changes. The expression of antimicrobial peptides, occludin, and ZO-1 significantly reduced, while that of JNK2 and Src/pSrc increased. Compared with micro-TiO2 particles, the nano-TiO2 particles had strong toxicity. Fecal microbiota transplant confirmed the key role of gut microbiota in intestinal toxicity. The levels of gut microbiota-host co-metabolites, including pyroglutamic acid, L-glutamic acid, phenylacetic acid, and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, changed significantly. Significant changes were observed in the glutathione and propanoate metabolic pathways. There was a significant correlation between the changes in gut microbiota, metabolites, and intestinal cytokine levels. These, together with the intestinal barrier damage signaling pathway, constitute the network mechanism of the intestinal toxicity of TiO2 particles.",-1
Implications of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,"Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a serious multifactorial autoinflammatory disease with a significant mortality rate due to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Recent research has deepened the knowledge about the pathophysiological mechanisms of sJIA-MAS, facilitating new targeted treatments, and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), which significantly changed the course of the disease and prognosis. This review highlights that children are less likely to suffer severe COVID-19 infection, but at approximately 2-4 weeks, some cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been reported, with a fulminant course. Previous established treatments for cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) have guided COVID-19 therapeutics. sJIA-MAS is different from severe cases of COVID-19, a unique immune process in which a huge release of cytokines will especially flood the lungs. In this context, MIS-C should be reinterpreted as a special MAS, and long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection can only be provided by the vaccine, but we do not yet have sufficient data. COVID-19 does not appear to have a substantial impact on rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) activity in children treated with bDMARDs, but the clinical features, severity and outcome in these patients under various drugs are not yet easy to predict. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are still needed to determine when and by what means immunoregulatory products should be administered to patients with sJIA-MAS with a negative corticosteroid response or contraindications, to optimize their health and safety in the COVID era.",-1
Exosomal Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and CPE-shRNA-Loaded Exosomes Regulate Metastatic Phenotype of Tumor Cells,"Background:                    Exosomes promote tumor growth and metastasis through intercellular communication, although the mechanism remains elusive. Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) supports the progression of different cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated whether CPE is the bioactive cargo within exosomes, and whether it contributes to tumorigenesis, using HCC cell lines as a cancer model.              Methods:                    Exosomes were isolated from supernatant media of cancer cells, or human sera. mRNA and protein expression were analyzed using PCR and Western blot. Low-metastatic HCC97L cells were incubated with exosomes derived from high-metastatic HCC97H cells. In other experiments, HCC97H cells were incubated with CPE-shRNA-loaded exosomes. Cell proliferation and invasion were assessed using MTT, colony formation, and matrigel invasion assays.              Results:                    Exosomes released from cancer cells contain CPE mRNA and protein. CPE mRNA levels are enriched in exosomes secreted from high- versus low-metastastic cells, across various cancer types. In a pilot study, significantly higher CPE copy numbers were found in serum exosomes from cancer patients compared to healthy subjects. HCC97L cells, treated with exosomes derived from HCC97H cells, displayed enhanced proliferation and invasion; however, exosomes from HCC97H cells pre-treated with CPE-shRNA failed to promote proliferation. When HEK293T exosomes loaded with CPE-shRNA were incubated with HCC97H cells, the expression of CPE, Cyclin D1, a cell-cycle regulatory protein and c-myc, a proto-oncogene, were suppressed, resulting in the diminished proliferation of HCC97H cells.              Conclusions:                    We identified CPE as an exosomal bioactive molecule driving the growth and invasion of low-metastatic HCC cells. CPE-shRNA loaded exosomes can inhibit malignant tumor cell proliferation via Cyclin D1 and c-MYC suppression. Thus, CPE is a key player in the exosome transmission of tumorigenesis, and the exosome-based delivery of CPE-shRNA offers a potential treatment for tumor progression. Notably, measuring CPE transcript levels in serum exosomes from cancer patients could have potential liquid biopsy applications.",-1
Intake of Bifidobacterium lactis Probio-M8 fermented milk protects against alcoholic liver disease,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a liver disease caused by long-term heavy drinking, which is characterized by increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver and gut dysbiosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of administering ordinary and probiotic- (containing the Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Probio-M8 strain; M8) fermented milk to rats. Several biochemical parameters and the fecal metagenomes were monitored before (d 0) and after (d 42) the intervention. Our results confirmed that alcohol could cause significant changes in the liver levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1Î², antioxidation indicators, and liver function-related indicators; meanwhile, the gut bacterial and viral microbiota were disrupted with significant reduction in microbial diversity and richness. Feeding the rats with Probio-M8-fermented milk effectively maintained the gut microbiota stability, reduced liver inflammation and oxidative stress, and mitigated liver damages in ALD. Moreover, the Probio-M8-fermented milk reversed alcohol-induced dysbiosis by restoring the gut microbiota diversity, richness, and composition. Four predicted fecal metabolites (inositol, tryptophan, cortisol, and vitamin K2) increased after the intervention, which might help regulate liver metabolism and alleviate ALD-related symptoms. In short, our data supported that consuming Probio-M8-fermented milk effectively mitigated ALD. The protective effect against ALD could be related to changes in the gut microbiome after probiotic-fermented milk consumption. However, such observation and the causal relationship among probiotic milk consumption, changes in gut microbiome, and disease alleviation would still need to be further confirmed. Nevertheless, this study has shown in a rat model that consuming probiotic-fermented milk could protect against ALD.",-1
Modest changes to glycemic regulation are sufficient to maintain glucose fluxes in healthy young men following overfeeding with a habitual macronutrient composition,"Currently, it is unclear whether short-term overfeeding in healthy people significantly affects postprandial glucose regulation, as most human overfeeding studies have utilized induced experimental conditions such as the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique to assess glucoregulation. The aim of this study was to quantify glucose fluxes [rates of meal glucose appearance (Ra), disposal (Rd), and endogenous glucose production (EGP)] in response to 5 and 28 days of overfeeding (+45% energy) while maintaining habitual macronutrient composition (31.0 Â± 1.9% fat, 48.6 Â± 2.2% carbohydrate, 16.7 Â± 1.4% protein) in healthy, lean young men. Meal tolerance testing was combined with the triple-stable isotope glucose tracer approach. Visceral adipose volume increased by ~15% with 5 days of overfeeding, while there was no further change at 28 days. In contrast, body mass (+1.6 kg) and fat mass (+1.3 kg) were significantly increased only after 28 days of overfeeding. Fasting EGP, Rd, and insulin were increased at 5 but unchanged after 28 days. Postprandial glucose and insulin responses were unaltered by 5 days of overfeeding but were modestly increased after 28 days (P < 0.05). However, meal Ra and glucose Rd were significantly increased after both 5 and 28 days of overfeeding (P < 0.05). Despite this, overfeeding did not lead to alterations to postprandial EGP suppression. Thus, in contrast to findings from euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies, chronic overfeeding did not affect the ability to suppress EGP or stimulate Rd under postprandial conditions. Rather, glucose flux was appropriately maintained following 28 days of overfeeding through modest increases in postprandial glycemia and insulinemia.",-1
miR-155 regulates physiological angiogenesis but an miR-155-rich microenvironment disrupts the process by promoting unproductive endothelial sprouting,"Angiogenesis involves cell specification orchestrated by regulatory interactions between the vascular endothelial growth factor and Notch signaling pathways. However, the role of microRNAs in these regulations remains poorly explored. Here we show that a controlled level of miR-155 is essential for proper angiogenesis. In the mouse retina angiogenesis model, antimiR-155 altered neovascularization. In vitro assays established that endogenous miR-155 is involved in podosome formation, activation of the proteolytic machinery and cell migration but not in morphogenesis. The role of miR-155 was explored using miR-155 mimics. In vivo, exposing the developing vasculature to miR-155 promoted hypersprouting, thus phenocopying defects associated with Notch deficiency. Mechanistically, miR-155 overexpression weakened Notch signaling by reducing Smad1/5 expression, leading to the formation of tip cell-like cells which did not reach full invasive capacity and became unable to undergo morphogenesis. These results identify miR-155 as a novel regulator of physiological angiogenesis and as a novel actor of pathological angiogenesis.",-1
Left Adrenal Ganglioneuroma Treated by Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy in a 41-Year-Old Woman: A Case Report,"BACKGROUND Ganglioneuromas are differentiated tumors originating from the neural crest. Although their occurrence is rare, they usually involve the posterior mediastinum and retroperitoneum. However, they rarely occur in the adrenal gland. Adrenal ganglioneuromas (AGNs) are hormonally inactive tumors that are mostly discovered incidentally during abdominal imaging performed for unrelated reasons. As preoperative diagnosis is challenging owing to their heterogeneous nature, adrenalectomy is the most effective method to ascertain an AGN diagnosis. We report a case of left adrenal ganglioneuroma treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. In addition, we have presented a relevant literature review to provide further information about this rare tumor. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with left flank pain associated with dysuria. She was diagnosed with renal colic, which was confirmed by computed tomography of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder. Additionally, an incidental solid lesion in the left adrenal gland was discovered. She was treated conservatively for her acute condition at the Emergency Department and discharged in a good condition. Further work-up including magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left large triangular suprarenal mixed soft tissue mass. She underwent laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. The final histopathology showed an AGN. CONCLUSIONS We present a case of a large AGN in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. Because it is a rare tumor with a heterogeneous presentation, its preoperative diagnosis is challenging. Thus, adrenalectomy is required to confirm the diagnosis. The prognosis is excellent and recurrence is extremely rare after tumor resection.",-1
"The influence of adiposity on the interactions between strength, physical function and cognition among older adults in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study","Background:                    Being overweight or obese may be associated with lower physical and cognitive function, but in late-adulthood (â?65 years) evidence is mixed. This study aimed to investigate how being overweight or obese affected interactions between muscle strength, function and cognition in Australians aged â?50 years, and whether interactions varied according to age (i.e. â?50-65 vs > 65 years).              Methods:                    This study included 2368 adults [mean (standard deviation) age: 63 (7) years; 56% female] from the 2011/2012 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) follow-up. Physical function was assessed via timed up-and-go (TUG) and muscle strength from knee extensor strength (KES). Cognition was assessed using Mini-Mental-State Exam (MMSE), Spot-the-Word (STW), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and Symbol-Digit-Modalities Test (SDMT). Beta binomial regression was used to evaluate how being overweight or obese influenced strength, physical and cognitive function associations.              Results:                    Being overweight or obese did not affect strength-cognition associations regardless of sex or age. With slower physical function; obese females showed better STW (odds ratio [OR] 95% CI]: 1.070 [1.016, 1.127], P = 0.011); obese men better MMSE (OR [95% CI]: 1.157 [1.012, 1.322], P = 0.033); and obese men aged > 65 better CVLT (OR [95% CI]: 1.122 [1.035, 1.217], P = 0.019) and MMSE (OR [95% CI]: 1.233 [1.049, 1.449], P = 0.017) compared to normal weight participants.              Conclusion:                    Slower physical function was associated with better performance in some cognitive domains in obese, but not in non-obese adults aged â?50 years. These findings suggest some benefits of obesity to aspects of cognition when physical function is slower, but longitudinal follow-up studies are needed.",-1
Skeletal muscle cell-specific differences in type 2 diabetes,"Major stores of glucose are found as glycogen in skeletal muscle and liver. Skeletal muscle is a heterogenous tissue, with cellular metabolic and contractile distinctions dependent on whether the cell (fibre) is slow-twitch (Type I) or fast-twitch (Type II). We hypothesised that proteins important for glycogen metabolism would be differentially abundant between these diverse fibres. We further hypothesised that the cellular location of these proteins would be different in muscle samples between control (CON) and individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We dissected individual muscle fibre segments from vastus lateralis skeletal muscle biopsy samples from CON and T2D and used cell-type-specific approaches to address muscle heterogeneity. We measured glycogen and glycogen-related proteins by immunoblotting techniques. A lower proportion of Type I fibres was found in muscle in T2D compared with CON. AMPK-Î²2, glycogen branching enzyme (GBE), glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE), and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) were differentially localized between fibre types and in fibres from CON and T2D individuals. A key novel finding was that the majority of glycogen is loosely bound or cytosolic in location in human skeletal muscle. The proportion of this diffusible pool of glycogen was significantly lower in Type I fibres in T2D compared to CON. A hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic clamp in people with type 2 diabetes had no effect on the proportion of diffusible glycogen. We identify cell-type as an important consideration when assessing glycogen metabolism in muscle. Our findings demonstrate varying glucose handling abilities in specific muscle fibre types in type 2 diabetes. A model is presented to provide an overview of the cell-specific differences in glycogen metabolism in type 2 diabetes.",-1
Oncolytic H-1 Parvovirus Hijacks Galectin-1 to Enter Cancer Cells,"Clinical studies in glioblastoma and pancreatic carcinoma patients strongly support the further development of H-1 protoparvovirus (H-1PV)-based anticancer therapies. The identification of cellular factors involved in the H-1PV life cycle may provide the knowledge to improve H-1PV anticancer potential. Recently, we showed that sialylated laminins mediate H-1PV attachment at the cell membrane. In this study, we revealed that H-1PV also interacts at the cell surface with galectin-1 and uses this glycoprotein to enter cancer cells. Indeed, knockdown/out of LGALS1, the gene encoding galectin-1, strongly decreases the ability of H-1PV to infect and kill cancer cells. This ability is rescued by the re-introduction of LGALS1 into cancer cells. Pre-treatment with lactose, which is able to bind to galectins and modulate their cellular functions, decreased H-1PV infectivity in a dose dependent manner. In silico analysis reveals that LGALS1 is overexpressed in various tumours including glioblastoma and pancreatic carcinoma. We show by immunohistochemistry analysis of 122 glioblastoma biopsies that galectin-1 protein levels vary between tumours, with levels in recurrent glioblastoma higher than those in primary tumours or normal tissues. We also find a direct correlation between LGALS1 transcript levels and H-1PV oncolytic activity in 53 cancer cell lines from different tumour origins. Strikingly, the addition of purified galectin-1 sensitises poorly susceptible GBM cell lines to H-1PV killing activity by rescuing cell entry. Together, these findings demonstrate that galectin-1 is a crucial determinant of the H-1PV life cycle.",-1
Effect of Microbiota in the Development of Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women and causes the greatest number of cancer-related death among women all over the world. It approximately accounts for 15% of all cancer death. The human microbiota is the term applied to the aggregate of microbes that live in different habitats of living organisms 'bodies, including the gut, skin, vagina, and mouth, as well as nose, conjunctiva, pharynx, and urethra, among others. Increasing evidence is pointing to the role of the microbiome in the occurrence and development of a variety of cancers. Intestinal microbiome imbalance is related to the occurrence of gastrointestinal tumors, such as esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and gallbladder cancer. The present study aimed to identify the role of microbiota in the development of breast cancer. The women with breast cancer (n=130) in this study were in the age range of 25-75 years. The study was conducted in Kirkuk city of Iraq from September 10, 2019, to March 15, 2020. The control group included 20 women diagnosed with benign breast lesions in the age range 25-75 years, who matched the women in the patient group. Blood samples and breast tissue samples were taken from patients with breast cancer and benign breast lesions. Blood samples were examined through immunological methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adopted for the detection of interleukin-19 (IL-19). Breast tissue samples were taken from breast cancer and benign breast lesions patients to isolate and identify bacteria. Based on the obtained results, only 6 out of 30 (20%) cultured breast tissue samples from women with breast cancer showed bacterial growth. In total, 4 (67%) and 2(33%) of these 6 positive cultures were Escherichia coli was and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively, and this relation was statistically significant. However, no bacterial growth was observed on the cultured breast tissue samples taken from women with benign breast lesions. Moreover, the difference between women with a positive and negative result of bacterial culture and stages of breast cancer was statistically non-significant. It is worth mentioning that 50 % of women with breast cancer and bacterial growth were within the age range of 40-49 year. The present study revealed that the difference between women with breast cancer and those with benign breast lesions was statistically highly significant according to the place of residence. In addition, the mean level of IL-19 among women with breast cancer was lower than that in women with benign breast lesions, and this relation was statistically highly significant.",-1
"Modulation of Intestinal Barrier, Inflammatory Response, and Gut Microbiota by Pediococcus pentosaceus zy-B Alleviates Vibrio parahaemolyticus Infection in C57BL/6J Mice","Modulation of the intestinal barrier, inflammation, and gut microbiota by Pediococcus pentosaceus zy-B (zy-B) in Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp)-infected C57BL/6J mice was studied. Mice intragastrically pretreated with 108 colony-forming units (CFU) zy-B significantly alleviated Vp infection as evidenced by maintaining body weight and reduced disease activity index score and intestine ratio. In addition, zy-B reduced the Vp load in the ileum and cecum, significantly reduced the load in the colon, prevented colonic atrophy, and strengthened mucosal integrity. Mechanistically, zy-B ameliorated intestinal barrier dysfunction by upregulating tight junction protein expression, which in turn reduced the lipopolysaccharide, d-lactic acid (d-LA), and diamine oxidase concentrations and downregulated the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and CB2 mRNA expressions. Moreover, zy-B systemically reduced inflammation by decreasing interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-Î± levels, and increased interleukin-10 (IL-10), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the colon and serum. Furthermore, zy-B markedly altered the gut microbiota composition by enriching Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus in the colon. Overall, zy-B appears to act as a probiotic to alleviate Vp infection by protecting the intestinal barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting the growth of ""beneficial"" gut microbiota.",-1
Characterizing mild cognitive impairment in prodromal Parkinson's disease: A community-based study in China,"Objective:                    The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) has published research criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease (pPD), which includes cognitive impairment as a prodromal marker. However, the clinical features of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in pPD remain unknown. Our study aimed to evaluate the frequency and clinical features of mild cognitive impairment of pPD in the elderly in China.              Methods:                    The cross-sectional community-based study recruited 2688 participants aged â?0 years. Subjects were diagnosed with pPD according to the MDS criteria. Overall, 39 pPD and 22 healthy controls underwent comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment. MCI was also diagnosed by the MDS criteria. Next, we investigated the relationship between clinical factors and cognition.              Results:                    Among the 2,663 dementia-free and Parkinson disease (PD)-free participants, 55 met the criteria for pPD (2.1%) and 23 pPD met the criteria for MCI. Memory, attention/working memory, and executive function were the most frequent impaired domains, and amnestic MCI multidomain phenotype was the most frequent MCI subtype (69.57%) in pPD. Additionally, correlation analysis revealed that the global cognitive performance was negatively related to UPDRS-III score (r = -0.456, p = 0.004).              Conclusion:                    MCI, specifically impairment in memory, attention/working memory, and executive domain, is present at the prodromal stage of PD. In addition, cognitive performance is correlated with motor symptoms in pPD. Our results reflect that cognitive profile, combined with motor symptoms, can help clinicians to identify individuals with pPD early, as those would be the optimal candidates for neuroprotective therapy.",-1
"Insecticide Resistance Patterns and Mechanisms in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) Populations Across Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire Reveal Emergent Pyrethroid Resistance","From 2008 to 2017, the city of Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire experienced several Aedes-borne disease epidemics which required control of the vector mosquito population based on the reduction of larval habitats and insecticidal sprays for adult mosquitoes. This study was undertaken to assess the insecticide susceptibility status of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) in the city of Abidjan. Immature Ae. aegypti were sampled from several larval habitats within seven communes of Abidjan and reared to adults. Three to five days old F1 emerged adults were tested for susceptibility using insecticide-impregnated papers and the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) following WHO bioassay guidelines. The results showed that Ae. aegypti populations from Abidjan were resistant to 0.1% propoxur, and 1% fenitrothion, with mortality rates ranging from 0% to 54.2%. Reduced susceptibility (93.4-97.5% mortality) was observed to 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.75% permethrin, 0.05% lambda-cyhalothrin, 5% malathion, and 0.8% chlorpyrifos-methyl. This reduced susceptibility varied depending on the insecticide and the collection site. The restoration of mortality when the mosquitoes were pre-exposed to the synergist PBO suggests that increased activity of oxidases could be contributing to resistance. Three kdr mutations (V410L, V1016I, and F1534C) were present in populations tested, with low frequencies for the Leu410 (0.28) and Ile1016 (0.32) alleles and high frequencies for the Cys1534 allele (0.96). These findings will be used to inform future arbovirus vector control activities in Abidjan.",-1
AI-based prevention of interval cancers in a national mammography screening program,"Purpose:                    To demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI) can detect and correctly localise retrospectively visible cancers that were missed and diagnosed as interval cancers (false negative (FN) and minimal signs (MS) interval cancers), and to characterise AI performance on non-visible occult and true interval cancers.              Method:                    Prior screening mammograms from N = 2,396 women diagnosed with interval breast cancer between March 2006 and May 2018 in north-western Germany were analysed with an AI system, producing a model score for all studies. All included studies previously underwent independent radiological review at a mammography reference centre to confirm interval cancer classification. Model score distributions were visualised with histograms. We computed the proportion and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CI) of retrospectively visible and true interval cancers detected and correctly localised by AI at different operating points representing recall rates < 3%. Clinicopathological characteristics of retrospectively visible cancers detected by AI and not were compared using the Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression.              Results:                    Following radiological review, 15.6% of the interval cancer cases were categorised as FN, 19.5% MS, 11.4% occult, and 53.4% true interval cancers. At an operating point of 99.0% specificity, AI could detect and correctly localise 27.5% (95% CI: 23.3-32.3%), and 12.2% (95% CI: 9.5-15.5%) of the FN and MS cases on the prior mammogram, respectively. 228 of these retrospectively visible cases were advanced/metastatic at diagnosis; 21.1% (95% CI: 16.3-26.8%) were found by AI on the screening mammogram. Increased likelihood of detection of retrospectively visible cancers with AI was observed for lower-grade carcinomas and those with involved lymph nodes at diagnosis. Among true interval cancers, AI could detect and correctly localise in the screening mammogram where subsequent malignancies would appear in 2.8% (95% CI: 2.0-3.9%) of cases.              Conclusions:                    AI can support radiologists by detecting a greater number of carcinomas, subsequently decreasing the interval cancer rate and the number of advanced and metastatic cancers.",-1
A novel approach to predicting the synergy of anti-cancer drug combinations using document-based feature extraction,"Background:                    To reduce drug side effects and enhance their therapeutic effect compared with single drugs, drug combination research, combining two or more drugs, is highly important. Conducting in-vivo and in-vitro experiments on a vast number of drug combinations incurs astronomical time and cost. To reduce the number of combinations, researchers classify whether drug combinations are synergistic through in-silico methods. Since unstructured data, such as biomedical documents, include experimental types, methods, and results, it can be beneficial extracting features from documents to predict anti-cancer drug combination synergy. However, few studies predict anti-cancer drug combination synergy using document-extracted features.              Results:                    We present a novel approach for anti-cancer drug combination synergy prediction using document-based feature extraction. Our approach is divided into two steps. First, we extracted documents containing validated anti-cancer drug combinations and cell lines. Drug and cell line synonyms in the extracted documents were converted into representative words, and the documents were preprocessed by tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal. Second, the drug and cell line features were extracted from the preprocessed documents, and training data were constructed by feature concatenation. A prediction model based on deep and machine learning was created using the training data. The use of our features yielded higher results compared to the majority of published studies.              Conclusions:                    Using our prediction model, researchers can save time and cost on new anti-cancer drug combination discoveries. Additionally, since our feature extraction method does not require structuring of unstructured data, new data can be immediately applied without any data scalability issues.",-1
Comparison of body composition and overactive bladder symptoms in overweight female university students,"Objectives:                    To compare body composition in young overweight women with OAB compared to women without OAB, and to determine the severity of the symptoms of OAB, as well as to investigate the impact of OAB on quality of life.              Study design:                    Cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 1932 enrolled women classed as overweight (BMI:25-29.9).From this sample, 276 women were recruited. Of these, 206 women with an average age of 30.6 Â± 20.4 years and an average BMI of 25.8 Â± 3.0 were confirmed to be overweight. We used the Voiding Diary, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire(OAB-q),and the Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QoL) scale. Body composition was measured using direct segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, with assessment of: skeletal muscle mass(kg)(SMM), body fat mass (kg)(BFM), body fat percentage (%)(BFP), visceral fat area (cm2/level)(VFA), and waist to hip ratio(WHR).              Results:                    The voiding diary and OAB-q results confirmed OAB in 102 women. There was no significant difference in BMI between groups. The body composition analysis showed significant differences in BFP, VFA, and WHR, with higher values in the OAB group(p < 0.01). SMM, however, was higher in the group without OAB(p < 0.01). Recorded I-QoL scores showed worse parameters in the OAB group(p < 0.001). Women with a body fat percentage above 32% have a 1.95 times greater chance of developing OAB. Odds ratio [OR] = 1.95,(95%CI:1.09-3.52,p < 0.02).              Conclusion:                    Body fat percentage, visceral fat area, and waist to hip ratio were significantly higher in overweight women with OAB, compared with women without OAB and a comparable BMI.",-1
Regulatory Mechanism of circEIF4G2 Targeting miR-26a in Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Background:                    Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) involves a series of complex cellular and molecular events, including circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other noncoding RNAs.              Objective:                    In this study, the regulation mechanism of circEIF4G2 acting on miR-26a on HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) proliferation, cell cycle and angiogenesis ability was mainly explored in the vascular endothelial growth factor induced (VEGF-induced) angiogenesis model.              Methods:                    VEGF induced HUVECs angiogenesis model was constructed, and the expression of circEIF4G2 and miR-26a in VEGF model was detected by qRT-PCR. When circEIF4G2 and miR-26a were knocked down or overexpressed in HUVECs, qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of circEIF4G2 and miR-26a, CCK-8 was used to detect cell proliferation, flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle transition of HUVECs, and cell formation experiment was used to detect the ability of angiogenesis. MiRanda database and Targetscan predicted the binding site of circEIF4G2 and miR-26a, lucifase reporting assay and RNA pull down assay verified the interaction between circEIF4G2 and miR-26a.              Results:                    After HUVECs were treated with VEGF, circEIF4G2 was significantly upregulated. After circEIF4G2 was knocked down, the proliferation and angiogenesis of HUVECs cells were decreased, and the process of cell cycle G0/G1 phase was blocked. The overexpression of miR-26a reduced the proliferation and angiogenesis of HUVECs cells and blocked the cell cycle progression of G0/G1 phase. Double lucifase reporter gene assay verified that circEIF4G2 could directly interact with miR-26a through the binding site, and RNA Pull down assay further verified the interaction between circEIF4G2 and miR-26a. When circEIF4G2 and miR-26a were knocked down simultaneously in HUVECs, it was found that knocking down miR-26a could reverse the inhibition of circEIF4G2 on cell proliferation, cycle and angiogenesis.              Conclusion:                    In the VEGF model, circEIF4G2 was highly expressed and miR-26a was low expressed. MiR-26a regulates HUVECs proliferation, cycle and angiogenesis by targeting circEIF4G2.",-1
Gut microbiota dynamics in a prospective cohort of patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome,"Background:                    Long-term complications after COVID-19 are common, but the potential cause for persistent symptoms after viral clearance remains unclear.              Objective:                    To investigate whether gut microbiome composition is linked to post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), defined as at least one persistent symptom 4 weeks after clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.              Methods:                    We conducted a prospective study of 106 patients with a spectrum of COVID-19 severity followed up from admission to 6 months and 68 non-COVID-19 controls. We analysed serial faecal microbiome of 258 samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and correlated the results with persistent symptoms at 6 months.              Results:                    At 6 months, 76% of patients had PACS and the most common symptoms were fatigue, poor memory and hair loss. Gut microbiota composition at admission was associated with occurrence of PACS. Patients without PACS showed recovered gut microbiome profile at 6 months comparable to that of non-COVID-19 controls. Gut microbiome of patients with PACS were characterised by higher levels of Ruminococcus gnavus, Bacteroides vulgatus and lower levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Persistent respiratory symptoms were correlated with opportunistic gut pathogens, and neuropsychiatric symptoms and fatigue were correlated with nosocomial gut pathogens, including Clostridium innocuum and Actinomyces naeslundii (all p<0.05). Butyrate-producing bacteria, including Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii showed the largest inverse correlations with PACS at 6 months.              Conclusion:                    These findings provided observational evidence of compositional alterations of gut microbiome in patients with long-term complications of COVID-19. Further studies should investigate whether microbiota modulation can facilitate timely recovery from post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.",-1
"Better TIR, HbA1c, and less hypoglycemia in closed-loop insulin system in patients with type 1 diabetes: a meta-analysis","The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of closed-loop insulin system (CLS) in non-pregnant patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using systematic review and meta-analysis. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on long-term use (not less than 8 weeks) of CLS in patients with T1DM were selected. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan V.5.3.5 to compare CLS with controls (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with blinded continuous glucose monitoring or unblinded sensor-augmented pump therapy or multiple daily injections or predictive low-glucose suspend system) in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. Research quality evaluation was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Eleven RCTs (817 patients) that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with controls, the CLS group had a favorable effect on the proportion of time with sensor glucose level in 3.9-10 mmol/L (10.32%, 8.70% to 11.95%), above 10 mmol/L (-8.89%, -10.57% to -7.22%), or below 3.9 mmol/L (-1.09%, -1.54% to -0.64%) over 24 hours. The CLS group also had lower glycated hemoglobin levels (-0.30%, -0.41% to -0.19%), and glucose variability, coefficient of variation of glucose, and SD were lower by 1.41 (-2.38 to -0.44, p=0.004) and 6.37 mg/dL (-9.19 mg/dL to -3.55 mg/dL, p<0.00001). There were no significant differences between the CLS and the control group in terms of daily insulin dose, quality of life assessment, and satisfaction with diabetes treatment. CLS is a better solution than control treatment in optimizing blood glucose management in patients with T1DM. CLS could become a common means of treating T1DM in clinical practice.",-1
USP10 inhibits the dopamine-induced reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis of neuronal cells by stimulating the antioxidant Nrf2 activity,"Nrf2 is an antioxidant transcriptional activator in many types of cells, and its dysfunction plays key roles in a variety of human disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD-affected brain regions. Dopamine treatment of neuronal cells stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases ROS-dependent neuronal apoptosis. In this study, we found that the ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10) protein reduces dopamine-induced ROS production of neuronal cells and ROS-dependent apoptosis by stimulating the antioxidant activity of Nrf2. USP10 interacted with the Nrf2 activator p62, increased the phosphorylation of p62, increased the interaction of p62 with the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1, and stimulated Nrf2 antioxidant transcriptional activity. In addition, USP10 augmented dopamine-induced Nrf2 translation. Taken together, these results indicate that USP10 is a key regulator of Nrf2 antioxidant activity in neuronal cells and suggest that USP10 activators are promising therapeutic agents for oxidative stress-related diseases, including PD.",-1
Beyond gut instincts: Microbe survival depends on sugars and butyrate,The factors and mechanisms that shape the composition and function of closely related members in a complex microbial community are largely unknown. The study by Park and colleagues reveals that the fitness of various Bacteroidales species and strains in the gut microbiome is regulated by butyrate in a glycan-dependent manner.,-1
Artificial neural network-boosted Cardiac Arrest Survival Post-Resuscitation In-hospital (CASPRI) score accurately predicts outcome in cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management,"Existing prognostic models to predict the neurological recovery in patients with cardiac arrest receiving targeted temperature management (TTM) either exhibit moderate accuracy or are too complicated for clinical application. This necessitates the development of a simple and generalizable prediction model to inform clinical decision-making for patients receiving TTM. The present study explores the predictive validity of the Cardiac Arrest Survival Post-resuscitation In-hospital (CASPRI) score in cardiac arrest patients receiving TTM, regardless of cardiac event location, and uses artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms to boost the prediction performance. This retrospective observational study evaluated the prognostic relevance of the CASPRI score and applied ANN to develop outcome prediction models in a cohort of 570 patients with cardiac arrest and treated with TTM between 2014 and 2019 in a nationwide multicenter registry in Taiwan. In univariate logistic regression analysis, the CASPRI score was significantly associated with neurological outcome, with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.811. The generated ANN model, based on 10 items of the CASPRI score, achieved a training AUC of 0.976 and validation AUC of 0.921, with the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 89.2%, 91.6%, 87.6%, and 91.2%, respectively, for the validation set. CASPRI score has prognostic relevance in patients who received TTM after cardiac arrest. The generated ANN-boosted, CASPRI-based model exhibited good performance for predicting TTM neurological outcome, thus, we propose its clinical application to improve outcome prediction, facilitate decision-making, and formulate individualized therapeutic plans for patients receiving TTM.",-1
"Cardiorespiratory fitness, visceral fat, and body fat, but not dietary inflammatory index, are related to C-reactive protein in cancer survivors","Background:                    The control of chronic inflammation has emerged as a target for improving the health of cancer survivors (CS).              Aim:                    To examine differences in fitness and dietary characteristics of CS when grouped by low vs. moderate to high serum C-reactive protein (CRP).              Methods:                    CS (N = 26, mean age = 68 Â± 12 years) were evaluated for body mass index (BMI), body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, dietary intake, dietary inflammatory index (DII), and serum CRP. Participants were assigned to one of two groups based on serum CRP concentrations: low CRP (â? mg/L) (LWC; n = 13) or moderate to high (CRP > 1 mg/L) (MHC; n = 13) and t-tests compared them. Data are presented as mean Â± SD.              Results:                    LWC had higher VO2peak values (mL/kg/min) (p = 0.0003), and lower visceral fat area (cm2) (p = 0.02) and body fat mass (kg) (p = 0.04). Secondary analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficients, including all current study participant data, found significant negative relationships between CRP and total dietary fat intake (p = 0.02), saturated fat (p = 0.03), and polyunsaturated fat (p = 0.03).              Conclusion:                    CS with moderate to high serum CRP concentrations had higher fat mass, visceral fat mass, and lower cardiorespiratory fitness. There was a significant negative relationship between dietary, fat, polyunsaturated and saturated fat, and CRP. However, these dietary fat related findings warrant further investigation. To summarize, improving cardiorespiratory fitness, maintaining lower body fat, may be helpful in altering chronic inflammation in CS.",-1
Packaging Big Data Visualization Based on Computational Intelligence Information Design,"A method based on a computational intelligence information model is proposed to study the visualization of large data packages. Since the CAIM algorithm only considers the distribution of the largest number of classes in an interval, it offers an optimization method and simultaneously determines the appropriate stopping conditions to avoid overcrowding. The effectiveness of the improved algorithm has been experimentally proven. Methods of character reduction and weight determination are used to reduce the index and weight, establishing a large packaging information system. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm in this article produces more classification rules than the CAIM algorithm, because the discrete intervals created by the CAIM algorithm are relatively simple, but the classification rules are few, but less than the number of CAIM algorithms. Classification rules are generated by entropy-based sampling algorithms. This can make the classification rules simple and universal, and it is clear that the optimal sampling algorithm is more accurate than the CAIM algorithm.",-1
Postload glucose spike but not fasting glucose determines prognosis after myocardial infarction in patients without known or newly diagnosed diabetes,"Background:                    The effect of postload glucose spikes (PGS), the difference between 2 hour post-load plasma glucose (2hPLPG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), on post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) prognosis in nondiabetic patients is unexplored.              Methods:                    This is a retrospective cohort analysis of 847 nondiabetic post-MI survivors who underwent a predischarge oral glucose tolerance test (median PGS: 2.4 mmol/L). Patients were divided into the unmatched groups 1 and 2 (PGS â?and > 2.4 mmol/L) and the propensity score-matched groups 1M and 2M (355 pairs assembled from the overall cohort), and these groups were compared. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death and nonfatal reinfarction) were recorded during follow-up (median: 3.4 years). Event-free survival was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression determined the predictors of MACE. C-statistics (change in area under the curve, Î´AUC), continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI>0 ), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to compare models.              Results:                    The number of MACE was higher in groups 2 (27.3% vs 14.2%, P < .001) and 2M (24.5% vs 15.5%, P < .001). Event-free survival was worse in groups 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.01; 95% CI, 1.49-2.71; P < .001) and 2M (HR 1.63; 95% CI, 1.17-2.27; P = .004). PGS independently predicted MACE-free survival in the whole (HR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06-1.26; P = .002) and matched cohort (HR 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.24; P = .021). PGS, but not FPG or 2hPPG, improved the predictive performance of the base model (Î´AUC 0.013, P = .046), with greater improvement seen when PGS was added and compared to 2hPPG (Î´AUC 0.005, P = .034; NRI>0 0.2107, P = .013; IDI 0.0042, P = .046).              Conclusion:                    PGS is a better predictor of post-MI prognosis than 2hPPG in nondiabetic patients.",-1
Differential circulating and visceral fat microRNA expression of non-obese and obese subjects,"Background & aims:                    Altered microRNA (miRNA) expression is associated with the pathophysiology of obesity; however, little is known about the miRNAs commonly dysregulated in the blood and visceral fat tissue of obese patients. This study compared the circulating and visceral fat miRNA expression in subjects with and without obesity.              Methods:                    For the circulating miRNA study, 20 healthy control and 30 obese subjects were recruited. For the tissue miRNA expression study, omental fat tissue was collected in ten female subjects each in the control and obese groups. MiRNA expression was measured by TaqMan low-density arrays. Metabolic risk factors were measured. Target genes for selected miRNAs were analyzed using informatics tools and a functional network map was constructed.              Results:                    11 miRNAs were down-regulated (miR-133a, -139-5p, -15b, -26a, -301, -30b, -30c, -374, -451, -570, and -636), and one was up-regulated (miR-155) in both depots in obese subjects. These miRNAs had significant associations with BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass. Among them, miR-15b, miR-26a, miR-301, miR-30b, and miR-30c had more predicted obesity-related target genes than other miRNAs. In particular, miR-15b had numerous target genes associated with adipogenesis, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, diabetes and insulin resistance, and mitochondrial function.              Conclusions:                    It is suggested that the miRNA alteration in the serum and visceral fat has pathophysiological implications for obesity. Our study identified dysregulated miRNAs that may be novel therapeutic targets to combat obesity.",-1
Temporal dynamics of cortical activity and postural control in response to the first levodopa dose of the day in people with Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    Our understanding of how balance control responds to levodopa over the course of a single day in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited with the majority of studies focused on isolated comparisons of ON vs. OFF levodopa medication.              Objective:                    To evaluate the temporal dynamics of postural control following the first levodopa dose of the day during a challenging standing task in a group of people with PD.              Methods:                    Changes in postural control were evaluated by monitoring cortical activity (covering frontal, motor, parietal and occipital areas), body sway parameters (force platform), and lower limb muscle activity (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis) in 15 individuals with PD during a semi-tandem standing task. Participants were assessed during two 60 second trials every 30 minutes (ON-30 ON-60 etc.) for 3 hours after the first matinal dose (ON-180).              Results:                    Compared to when tested OFF-medication, cortical activity was increased across all four regions from ON-60 to ON-120 with early increases in alpha and beta band activity observed at ON-30. Levodopa was associated with increased gastrocnemius medialis activity (ON-30 to ON-120) and ankle co-contraction (ON-60 to ON-120). Changes in body sway outcomes (particularly in the anterior-posterior direction) were evident from ON-60 to ON-120.              Conclusions:                    Our results reveal a 60-minute window within which postural control outcomes may be obtained that are different compared to OFF-state and remain stable (from 60-minutes to 120-minutes after levodopa intake). Identifying a window of opportunity for measurement when individuals are optimally medicated is important for observations in a clinical and research setting.",-1
Identification of key regulatory genes connected to NF-ÎºB family of proteins in visceral adipose tissues using gene expression and weighted protein interaction network,"Obesity is connected to the activation of chronic inflammatory pathways in both adipocytes and macrophages located in adipose tissues. The nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB is a central molecule involved in inflammatory pathways linked to the pathology of different complex metabolic disorders. Investigating the gene expression data in the adipose tissue would potentially unravel disease relevant gene interactions. The present study is aimed at creating a signature molecular network and at prioritizing the potential biomarkers interacting with NF-ÎºB family of proteins in obesity using system biology approaches. The dataset GSE88837 associated with obesity was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Statistical analysis represented the differential expression of a total of 2650 genes in adipose tissues (p = <0.05). Using concepts like correlation, semantic similarity, and theoretical graph parameters we narrowed down genes to a network of 23 genes strongly connected with NF-ÎºB family with higher significance. Functional enrichment analysis revealed 21 of 23 target genes of NF-ÎºB were found to have a critical role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Interestingly, GEM and PPP1R13L were predicted as novel genes which may act as potential target or biomarkers of obesity as they occur with other 21 target genes with known obesity relationship. Our study concludes that NF-ÎºB and prioritized target genes regulate the inflammation in adipose tissues through several molecular signaling pathways like NF-ÎºB, PI3K-Akt, glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network, angiogenesis and cytokine pathways. This integrated system biology approaches can be applied for elucidating functional protein interaction networks of NF-ÎºB protein family in different complex diseases. Our integrative and network-based approach for finding therapeutic targets in genomic data could accelerate the identification of novel drug targets for obesity.",-1
Association between Inflammation and Functional Outcome in Patients with Sarcopenic Dysphagia,"Objectives:                    This study aimed to investigate whether inflammation affects the outcome of swallowing ability to improve treatment for sarcopenic dysphagia.              Design:                    A retrospective observational cohort study was performed using data from the Japanese sarcopenic dysphagia database.              Setting:                    The database was constructed using data from 19 hospitals and one home visiting rehabilitation team.              Participants:                    Patients with sarcopenic dysphagia with measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (Alb) were included.              Measurements:                    Patients were assigned to two groups using CRP, Alb, and the Japanese modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS). The Food Intake LEVEL Scale (FILS) was measured at the times of admission and follow-up (FILS follow-up) to assess swallowing function.              Results:                    A total of 197 patients were included. Mean or median values of each parameter were as follows: age: 83.8Â±8.7, Alb: 3.2 Â± 0.6 g/dL, CRP: 8.0 [3.0, 29.0] mg/L, mGPS: 1 [1-2], FILS: 7 [6-8], FILS follow-up: 8 [7-8], and duration of follow-up: 57.0 [27.0, 85.0] days. The FILS score at follow-up was significantly lower in the high CRP group (â?5.0 mg/L) than in the low CRP group (< 5.0 mg/L) (p = 0.01). Further, the FILS score at follow-up was significantly lower in the high mGPS group (class; 2) than in the low mGPS group (class; 0 and 1) (p = 0.03). In the multiple linear regression analyses without FILS at baseline, CRP and mGPS were independent risk factors for FILS follow-up. When FILS at baseline was entered, CRP and mGPS were not an independent risk factors for FILS follow-up.              Conclusions:                    Inflammation could modify the outcome of the patients with sarcopenic dysphagia. Inflammation may be an important risk factor in evaluating patients with sarcopenic dysphagia.",-1
Spatial Repellents Protect Small Perimeters from Riceland Mosquitoes in a Warm-Humid Environment,"Recent experiments suggest spatial repellents may significantly reduce biting pressure from host-seeking riceland mosquitoes, such as Anopheles quadrimaculatus, in a warm-humid open-field habitat. However, little is known regarding efficacy of these formulations in partially enclosed spaces where US military personnel may be sheltered or concealed in an operational environment. In this study we investigated the capability of 3 spatial repellents-metofluthrin, linalool, and d-cis/trans allethrin-to reduce mosquito incursion into small open-top enclosures of US military camouflage netting. We found that metofluthrin was more effective in partially enclosed spaces compared with the open field, whereas both linalool and d-cis/trans allethrin provided superior protection in the open. These findings support strategic selection of spatial repellents depending on the environment immediately surrounding the host.",-1
Clinical and experimental studies of intraperitoneal lipolysis and the development of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula after pancreatic surgery,"Background:                    Visceral obesity is one of the risk factors for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula after pancreatic resection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of intraperitoneal lipolysis on postoperative pancreatic fistula.              Methods:                    The degree of intraperitoneal lipolysis was investigated by measuring the free fatty acid concentration in drain discharge in patients after pancreatic resection. An experimental pancreatic fistula model was prepared by pancreatic transection, and the impact of intraperitoneal lipolysis was evaluated by intraperitoneal administration of triolein (triglyceride) with, or without orlistat (lipase inhibitor).              Results:                    Thirty-three patients were included in the analysis. The free fatty acid concentration in drain discharge on postoperative day 1 was significantly associated with the development of a clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (P = 0Â·004). A higher free fatty acid concentration in drain discharge was associated with more visceral adipose tissue (P = 0Â·009). In the experimental model that included 98 rats, intraperitoneal lipolysis caused an increased amount of pancreatic juice leakage and multiple organ dysfunction. Intraperitoneal administration of a lipase inhibitor reduced lipolysis and prevented deterioration of the fistula.              Conclusion:                    Intraperitoneal lipolysis significantly exacerbates pancreatic fistula after pancreatic resection. Inhibition of lipolysis by intraperitoneal administration of a lipase inhibitor could be a promising therapy to reduce clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula. Surgical relevance Clinically, there are two types of pancreatic fistula after pancreatic resections: harmless biochemical leak and harmful clinically relevant pancreatic fistula. Visceral obesity is one of the known risk factors for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula; however, the underlying mechanisms remained to be elucidated. Patients with clinically relevant pancreatic fistula had a higher free fatty acid concentration in the drain discharge, suggesting a relationship between intraperitoneal lipolysis and pancreatic fistula. The experimental model of pancreatic fistula demonstrated that intraperitoneal lipolysis caused deterioration in pancreatic fistula, suggesting that intraperitoneal lipolysis is one of the mechanisms that drives biochemical leakage to clinically relevant pancreatic fistula. Intraperitoneal administration of a lipase inhibitor prevented lipolysis as well as pancreatic fistula deterioration in the experimental model, suggesting a future clinical application for lipase inhibitors in prevention of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula.",-1
Intelligent and robust DNA robots capable of swarming into leakless nonlinear amplification in response to a trigger,"Nonlinear DNA signal amplification with an enzyme-free isothermal self-assembly process is uniquely useful in nanotechnology and nanomedicine. However, progress in this direction is hampered by the lack of effective design models of leak-resistant DNA building blocks. Here, we propose two conceptual models of intelligent and robust DNA robots to perform a leakless nonlinear signal amplification in response to a trigger. Two conceptual models are based on super-hairpin nanostructures, which are designed by innovating novel principles in methodology and codifying them into embedded programs. The dynamical and thermodynamical analyses reveal the critical elements and leak-resistant mechanisms of the designed models, and the leak-resistant behaviors of the intelligent DNA robots and morphologies of swarming into nonlinear amplification are separately verified. The applications of the designed models are also illustrated in specific signal amplification and targeted payload enrichment via integration with an aptamer, a fluorescent molecule and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This work has the potential to serve as design guidelines of intelligent and robust DNA robots and leakless nonlinear DNA amplification, and also as the design blueprint of cargo delivery robots with the performance of swarming into nonlinear amplification in response to a target automatically, facilitating their future applications in biosensing, bioimaging and biomedicine.",-1
Molecular epidemiology of mosquito-borne viruses at the China-Myanmar border: discovery of a potential epidemic focus of Japanese encephalitis,"Background:                    Mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance can serve as an early warning in evaluating the status of mosquito-borne virus prevalence and thus prevent local outbreaks. Although Tengchong County in Yunnan Province-which borders Myanmar-is abundant and diverse in mosquitoes, very few mosquito-based arbovirus investigations have been conducted in the recent decade. Herein, this study aims to evaluate the presence and the diffusion of mosquito-borne pathogens, currently prevalent in this region.              Methods:                    We collected 9486 mosquitoes, representing eight species, with Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles sinensis as the dominant species, during high mosquito activity seasons (July-October) in Tengchong, in 2018. Samples collected from 342 pools were tested using reverse-transcription PCR to determine the species, distribution, and infection rates of virus and parasite, and further analyze their genotypes, phylogenetic relationships, infection rate, and potential pathogenicity.              Results:                    Fifteen Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strains from Cx. tritaeniorhynchus pools were detected. Seven strains of insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs), including two Aedes flavivirus (AeFV) and Yunnan Culex flavivirus strains each, one Culex theileri flavivirus, Yamadai flavivirus (YDFV) and Anopheles-associated flavivirus (AAFV) strains each were detected in Aedes albopictus, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vagans, Cx. pseudovihnui, and An. sinensis pools, respectively. The whole-genome was successfully amplified in one strain of JEV and AeFV each. Phylogenetic analysis using the E gene placed all the newly detected JEV strains into the GI-b genotype. They showed highly nucleotide identities, and were most closely related to the strain detected in Tengchong in 2010. The comparison of the E protein of JEV strains and vaccine-derived strain, showed six amino residue differences. The bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimation values (and 95% confidence interval) for JEV in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus collected in Tengchong in 2018 were 2.4 (1.4-3.9).              Conclusions:                    A potential Japanese encephalitis epidemic focus with the abundance of host mosquitoes and high JEV infection rate was observed in Tengchong. In addition, at least five species of ISFVs co-circulate in this area. This study highlights the importance of widespread and sustained mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance in local areas to prevent the transmission of JEV, and other emerging/re-emerging mosquito-borne pathogens.",-1
A non-destructive sugar-feeding assay for parasite detection and estimating the extrinsic incubation period of Plasmodium falciparum in individual mosquito vectors,"Despite its epidemiological importance, the time Plasmodium parasites take to achieve development in the vector mosquito (the extrinsic incubation period, EIP) remains poorly characterized. A novel non-destructive assay designed to estimate EIP in single mosquitoes, and more broadly to study Plasmodium-Anopheles vectors interactions, is presented. The assay uses small pieces of cotton wool soaked in sugar solution to collect malaria sporozoites from individual mosquitoes during sugar feeding to monitor infection status over time. This technique has been tested across four natural malaria mosquito species of Africa and Asia, infected with Plasmodium falciparum (six field isolates from gametocyte-infected patients in Burkina Faso and the NF54 strain) and across a range of temperatures relevant to malaria transmission in field conditions. Monitoring individual infectious mosquitoes was feasible. The estimated median EIP of P. falciparum at 27 Â°C was 11 to 14 days depending on mosquito species and parasite isolate. Long-term individual tracking revealed that sporozoites transfer onto cotton wool can occur at least until day 40 post-infection. Short individual EIP were associated with short mosquito lifespan. Correlations between mosquito/parasite traits often reveal trade-offs and constraints and have important implications for understanding the evolution of parasite transmission strategies.",-1
Adipocytes: A Novel Target for IL-15/IL-15RÎ± Cancer Gene Therapy,"IL-15 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an essential role in the development and activation of natural killer (NK) cells. Adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ that secretes cytokines and is an important reservoir for lymphocytes. We hypothesized that activation of the IL-15 signaling in adipose tissue will activate and expand the NK cell population and control tumor growth. We recently developed an adipocyte-targeting recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector with minimal off-target transgene expression in the liver. Here, we used this rAAV system to deliver an IL-15/IL-15RÎ± complex to the abdominal fat by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Adipose IL-15/IL-15RÎ± complex gene transfer led to the expansion of NK cells in the adipose tissue and spleen in normal mice without notable side effects. The i.p. injection of rAAV-IL-15/IL-15RÎ± complex significantly suppressed the growth of Lewis lung carcinoma implanted subcutaneously and exerted a significant survival advantage in a B16-F10 melanoma metastasis model. The antitumor effects were associated with the expansion of the NK cells in the blood, spleen, abdominal fat, and tumor, as well as the enhancement of NK cell maturity. Our proof-of-concept preclinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the adipocyte-specific IL-15/IL-15RÎ± complex vector as a novel cancer immune gene therapy.",-1
The 6-hydroxydopamine Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease,"Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD)-bradykinesia, akinesia, and tremor at rest-are consequences of the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and dopaminergic striatal deficit. Animal models have been widely used to simulate human pathology in the laboratory. Rodents are the most used animal models for PD due to their ease of handling and maintenance. Moreover, the anatomy and molecular, cellular, and pharmacological mechanisms of PD are similar in rodents and humans. The infusion of the neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), into a medial forebrain bundle (MFB) of rats reproduces the severe destruction of dopaminergic neurons and simulates PD symptoms. This protocol demonstrates how to perform the unilateral microinjection of 6-OHDA in the MFB in a rat model of PD and shows the motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA and predicted dopaminergic lesions through the stepping test. The 6-OHDA causes significant impairment in the number of steps performed with the contralateral forelimb.",-1
Attention2majority: Weak multiple instance learning for regenerative kidney grading on whole slide images,"Deep learning consistently demonstrates high performance in classifying and segmenting medical images like CT, PET, and MRI. However, compared to these kinds of images, whole slide images (WSIs) of stained tissue sections are huge and thus much less efficient to process, especially for deep learning algorithms. To overcome these challenges, we present attention2majority, a weak multiple instance learning model to automatically and efficiently process WSIs for classification. Our method initially assigns exhaustively sampled label-free patches with the label of the respective WSIs and trains a convolutional neural network to perform patch-wise classification. Then, an intelligent sampling method is performed in which patches with high confidence are collected to form weak representations of WSIs. Lastly, we apply a multi-head attention-based multiple instance learning model to do slide-level classification based on high-confidence patches (intelligently sampled patches). Attention2majority was trained and tested on classifying the quality of 127 WSIs (of regenerated kidney sections) into three categories. On average, attention2majority resulted in 97.4%Â±2.4 AUC for the four-fold cross-validation. We demonstrate that the intelligent sampling module within attention2majority is superior to the current state-of-the-art random sampling method. Furthermore, we show that the replacement of random sampling with intelligent sampling in attention2majority results in its performance boost (from 94.9%Â±3.1 to 97.4%Â±2.4 average AUC for the four-fold cross-validation). We also tested a variation of attention2majority on the famous Camelyon16 dataset, which resulted in 89.1%Â±0.8 AUC1. When compared to random sampling, the attention2majority demonstrated excellent slide-level interpretability. It also provided an efficient framework to arrive at a multi-class slide-level prediction.",-1
The Role of Microbiota in the Immunopathogenesis of Endometrial Cancer,"The female reproductive tract hosts a specific microbiome, which plays a crucial role in sustaining equilibrium and good health. In the majority of reproductive women, the microbiota (all bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other single-celled organisms within the human body) of the vaginal and cervical microenvironment are dominated by Lactobacillus species, which benefit the host through symbiotic relationships, in comparison to the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, which may contain a low-biomass microbiome with a diverse mixture of microorganisms. Although disruption to the balance of the microbiota develops, the altered immune and metabolic signaling may cause an impact on diseases such as cancer. These pathophysiological modifications in the gut-uterus axis may spark gynecological cancers. New information displays that gynecological and gastrointestinal tract dysbiosis (disruption of the microbiota homeostasis) can play an active role in the advancement and metastasis of gynecological neoplasms, such as cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. Understanding the relationship between microbiota and endometrial cancer is critical for prognosis, diagnosis, prevention, and the development of innovative treatments. Identifying a specific microbiome may become an effective method for characterization of the specific microbiota involved in endometrial carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to summarize the current state of knowledge that describes the correlation of microbiota with endometrial cancer with regard to the formation of immunological pathologies.",-1
N 6-Methyladenosine-Modified circRNA in the Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cells Injured by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli,"Mastitis is a common disease that hinders the development of dairy industry and animal husbandry. It leads to the abuse of antibiotics and the emergence of super drug-resistant bacteria, and poses a great threat to human food health and safety. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are the most common pathogens of mastitis in dairy cows and usually cause subclinical or clinical mastitis. CircRNAs and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) play important roles in immunological diseases. However, the mechanisms by which m6A modifies circRNA in bovine mammary epithelial cells remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to investigate m6A-modified circRNAs in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T cells) injured by S. aureus and E. coli. The profile of m6A-modified circRNA showed a total of 1,599 m6A peaks within 1,035 circRNAs in the control group, 35 peaks within 32 circRNAs in the S. aureus group, and 1,016 peaks within 728 circRNAs in the E. coli group. Compared with the control group, 67 peaks within 63 circRNAs were significantly different in the S. aureus group, and 192 peaks within 137 circRNAs were significantly different in the E. coli group. Furthermore, we found the source genes of these differentially m6A-modified circRNAs in the S. aureus and E. coli groups with similar functions according to GO and KEGG analyses, which were mainly associated with cell injury, such as inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction networks predicted the potential circRNA regulation mechanism in S. aureus- and E. coli-induced cell injury. We found that the mRNAs in the networks, such as BCL2, MIF, and TNFAIP8L2, greatly participated in the MAPK, WNT, and inflammation pathways. This is the first report on m6A-modified circRNA regulation of cells under S. aureus and E. coli treatment, and sheds new light on potential mechanisms and targets from the perspective of epigenetic modification in mastitis and other inflammatory diseases.",-1
An improved genetic algorithm and its application in neural network adversarial attack,"The choice of crossover and mutation strategies plays a crucial role in the searchability, convergence efficiency and precision of genetic algorithms. In this paper, a novel improved genetic algorithm is proposed by improving the crossover and mutation operation of the simple genetic algorithm, and it is verified by 15 test functions. The qualitative results show that, compared with three other mainstream swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, the algorithm can not only improve the global search ability, convergence efficiency and precision, but also increase the success rate of convergence to the optimal value under the same experimental conditions. The quantitative results show that the algorithm performs superiorly in 13 of the 15 tested functions. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for statistical evaluation, showing the significant advantage of the algorithm at 95% confidence intervals. Finally, the algorithm is applied to neural network adversarial attacks. The applied results show that the method does not need the structure and parameter information inside the neural network model, and it can obtain the adversarial samples with high confidence in a brief time just by the classification and confidence information output from the neural network.",-1
"Culex/ mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) recorded along the Nile River in central and northern Sudan, with a key for the identification of all species of the genus known to occur in the country","Despite the importance of Culex species as major vectors of Rift Valley fever virus, West Nile virus and the microfilariae that cause lymphatic filariasis, information on these mosquitoes in Sudan is limited to works published 65 years ago in the former Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, where some species were only recorded from areas of the territory now known as South Sudan. In this paper, we provide updated information on Culex mosquitoes collected indoors during surveillance studies conducted along the Nile River in central and northern areas of Sudan between 2012 and 2019. Of 3,411 female mosquitoes collected in Khartoum and northern states along the river, 2,560 (75%) were specimens of Culex belonging to 12 species: Cx. (Culex) antennatus (Becker, 1903), Cx. (Cux.) laticinctus Edwards, 1913, Cx. (Cux.) neavei Theobald, 1906, Cx. (Cux.) pipiens Linnaeus, 1758, Cx. (Cux.) perexiguus Theobald, 1903, Cx. (Cux.) poicilipes (Theobald, 1903), Cx. (Cux.) quinquefasciatus Say, 1823, Cx. (Cux.) simpsoni Theobald, 1905, Cx. (Cux.) sinaiticus Kirkpatrick, 1925, Cx. (Cux.) theileri Theobald, 1903, Cx. (Cux.) tritaeniorhynchus Giles, 1901 and Cx. (Culiciomyia) macfiei Edwards, 1923. This is the first record for Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. macfiei in central Sudan. The relative abundance of each species varied in different areas and seasons, but Cx. antennatus and Cx. quinquefasciatus were the most abundant indoor resting species. We provide an updated dichotomous key for the identiï¬cation of the adults of Culex mosquitoes known to occur in the Republic of the Sudan.",-1
Four Weeks of Preoperative Omega-3 Fatty Acids Reduce Liver Volume: a Randomised Controlled Trial,"Purpose:                    Weight loss before bariatric surgery with a low-calorie diet (LCD) has several advantages, including reduction of liver volume and an improved access to the lesser sac. Disadvantages include performing surgery in a state of undernutrition, side effects, costs and patient compliance. Omega-3 fatty acids may serve as an alternative to reduce liver steatosis.              Materials and methods:                    A randomised controlled open-label trial was done to compare the effects of a LCD with Modifast (800 kcal/day) during 2 weeks with 2 g of omega-3 fatty acids a day and a normal diet (2000 kcal/day) during 4 weeks. Total liver volume (TLV) and volume of the left liver lobe (LLL), visceral fat area (VFA) and muscle area (SMA) at the L3-L4 level were measured with MRI before and after preoperative treatment.              Results:                    Sixty-two morbidly obese women undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (LRYGB) were recruited. In both groups, there was a significant decrease in LLL, TLV and VFA. For LLL and TLV reduction, the LCD had a significantly larger effect (p < 0.05). Only in the LCD group was there a significant decrease in SMA with significantly more side effects and worse compliance.              Conclusion:                    Both the LCD and omega-3 diet reduced LLL, TLV and VFA. The LCD outperformed the omega-3 diet in LLL and TLV reduction, but induced significant loss of SMA and had worse compliance due to more side effects. Omega-3 fatty acids may provide a safe and more patient-friendly alternative for a LCD and further research is indicated.              Trial registration:                    The study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02206256).",-1
Effects of intensive insulin therapy on the retinal microvasculature in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a prospective observational study,"Background:                    We examined the retinal microvascular changes and associated factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) before and after intensive insulin therapy.              Methods:                    This prospective observational study recruited patients with T2DM and divided them into intensive insulin therapy and oral hypoglycemic agent groups. All patients enrolled in this study had diabetes without retinopathy or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used in all patients before treatment and at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Vessel density (VD) and thickness changes in the macular and optic disc areas were assessed.              Results:                    The study included 36 eyes in the intensive insulin therapy group and 36 in the oral hypoglycemic agent group. One month after treatment, VD in the deep capillary plexus (DCP) and peripapillary capillary VD (ppVD) were significantly decreased by intensification (P = 0.009, 0.000). At three months after treatment, decreases in VD induced by intensification were found in the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), DCP, foveal density in a 300-Î¼m-wide region around the foveal avascular area (FD-300), and ppVD (P = 0.032, 0.000, 0.039, 0.000). Six months after treatment, decreases in VD by intensification were observed in the DCP and ppVD groups (P = 0.000, 0.000). Vessel density showed no significant change in the oral hypoglycemic agent group after treatment. The amount of DCP-VD reduction was correlated with macular thickening (r = 0.348, P = 0.038; r = 0.693, P = 0.000 and r = 0.417, P = 0.011, respectively) after intensive insulin therapy.              Conclusions:                    Insulin-intensive treatment caused a transient reduction in vessel density in the macular and optic disc areas. DCP-VD and ppVD were more susceptible at an earlier stage. Retinal microvasculature monitoring using OCTA is vital for patients with type 2 diabetes receiving intensive insulin therapy.",-1
Passive Smoking and Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus among Nonsmoking Women: A Prospective Cohort Study in China,"Background:                    Increasing evidence has shown that active smoking can increase the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but the effect of passive smoking is still unknown. Women in pregnancy are vulnerable to secondhand smoke. This study explored the association of passive smoking with GDM in China.              Method:                    A total of 3083 nonsmoking pregnant women living in Beijing were recruited into a prospective cohort study. Sociodemographic and passive smoking data were collected with structured questionnaires during face-to-face interviews. Glucose levels were measured by physicians according to standard protocols. Multivariate logistic regression was performed for the association estimation after accounting for potential confounders.              Result:                    In total, 562 of the 3083 participants developed GDM (18.23%); 779 participants (25.27%) reported exposure to passive smoking. After adjusting for age, BMI, ethnicity, education, occupation, and parity, passive smoking conferred an approximately 1.4-fold risk increase in GDM (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.11, 1.70)). The adjusted ORs with 95% CIs for passive smoking levels of &lt;1, 1-6, and â? times per week were 1.21 (0.94, 1.55), 1.81 (1.22, 2.69), and 1.70 (1.02, 2.84), respectively. An obvious passive-smoking-GDM association was observed among only nulliparous women (adjusted OR = 1.45, 95% CI: (1.14, 1.85)).              Conclusion:                    Frequent exposure to secondhand smoke could increase the risk of GDM among nonsmoking pregnant women. Parity status might modify their association. Public policies should be advocated to prevent passive smoking among this population.",-1
Integration of intestinal microbiota and metabonomics to elucidate different alleviation impacts of non-saponification and saponification astaxanthin pre-treatment on paracetamol-induced oxidative stress in rats,"Intestinal microbiota and metabonomics were integrated to investigate the efficiency of non-saponification or saponification astaxanthin (N-Asta or S-Asta) derived from Penaeus sinensis by-products on alleviating paracetamol (PCM)-induced oxidative stress. Pre-treatment with N-Asta or S-Asta for 14 days restored the cellular morphology of the intestine and increased glutathione (GSH) levels under PCM overdose in rats. However, S-Asta displayed higher adsorption than that of N-Asta. PCM overdose reduced the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota in the model group. Comparably, N-Asta or S-Asta pre-treatment increased the Actinobacteria abundance. Increased phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were only found in the S-Asta-pre-treated group. At the genus level, N-Asta pre-treatment increased Lactobacillus and Parasutterella abundance, whereas S-Asta pre-treatment elevated Bacteroidales_S24-7_group_norank and Ruminococcaceae_uncultured. Compared to the control and model groups, remarkable increases of fecal short-chain fatty acids were detected in both N-Asta and S-Asta pre-treatment groups, suggesting the contribution of N-Asta and S-Asta adsorption to SCFA-producing bacteria enrichment. Furthermore, the genera of Ruminococcaceae_uncultured, Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_unclassified and Ruminococcus_1 showed high correlations with propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid and valeric acid increases in the S-Asta pre-treated group. Seventeen plasma biomarker metabolites in more than 10 metabolic pathways were responsible for the difference between the N-Asta and S-Asta pre-treated groups. Metabolites GSH, retinol, all-trans-Retinoic acid and taurine related to antioxidant activities were significantly accumulated in the S-Asta pre-treated group, while increasing taurocholic acid levels associated with the anti-inflammatory activity was found in the N-Asta-pre-treated group. Therefore, N-Asta and S-Asta could have potential applications in counterbalancing intestinal flora and metabolite disturbances by overdose chemical induction.",-1
A Productive Expression Platform Derived from Host-Restricted Eilat Virus: Its Extensive Validation and Novel Strategy,"Most alphaviruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and infect a wide range of insects and vertebrates. However, Eilat virus (EILV) is defective for infecting vertebrate cells at multiple levels of the viral life cycle. This host-restriction property renders EILV an attractive expression platform since it is not infectious for vertebrates and therefore provides a highly advantageous safety profile. Here, we investigated the feasibility of versatile EILV-based expression vectors. By replacing the structural genes of EILV with those of other alphaviruses, we generated seven different chimeras. These chimeras were readily rescued in the original mosquito cells and were able to reach high titers, suggesting that EILV is capable of packaging the structural proteins of different lineages. We also explored the ability of EILV to express authentic antigens via double subgenomic (SG) RNA vectors. Four foreign genetic materials of varied length were introduced into the EILV genome, and the expressed heterologous genetic materials were readily detected in the infected cells. By inserting an additional SG promoter into the chimera genome containing the structural genes of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we developed a bivalent vaccine candidate against CHIKV and Zika virus. These data demonstrate the outstanding compatibility of the EILV genome. The produced recombinants can be applied to vaccine and diagnostic tool development, but more investigations are required.",-1
"Improved diabetes control, allowing insulin cessation, after direct acting antiviral treatment (DAAT) of hepatitis C","There is a bidirectional relationship between hepatitis C and type 2 diabetes. The risk for developing type 2 diabetes is increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection-with the prevalence of diabetes ranging from 13% to 33%. This is likely underpinned by insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes may also be a predisposing factor for HCV infection. The new non-interferon-based therapeutic regimens for hepatitis C have transformed care and can eradicate disease. In this report, we show how such a regimen eradicated viral load, improved hepatocellular blood markers and significantly improved dysglycaemia, such that all glucose-lowering medication could be stopped.",-1
Fasting blood glucose level is a predictor of mortality in patients with COVID-19 independent of diabetes history,"Aim:                    No study elucidated the role of fasting blood glucose (FBG) level in the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).              Methods:                    This cohort study was conducted in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Clinical laboratory, and treatment data of inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without pre-existing diabetes were compared. The associations of diabetes history and/or FBG levels with mortality were analyzed. Multivariate cox regression analysis on the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 was performed.              Results:                    A total of 941 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. There was a positive relationship between pre-existing diabetes and the mortality of patients who developed COVID-19 (21 of 123 [17.1%] vs 76 of 818 [9.3%]; P = 0.012). FBG â?.0 mmol/L was an independent risk factor for the mortality of COVID-19 regardless of the presence or not of a history of diabetes (hazard ratio, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.21-4.03]; P = 0.010).              Conclusions:                    We firstly showed FBG â?.0 mmol/L predicted worse outcome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 independent of diabetes history. Our findings indicated screening FBG level is an effective method to evaluate the prognosis of patients with COVID-19.",-1
Expression of cardiovascular-related microRNAs is altered in L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficient mice,"In humans and mice, L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and its metabolites homoarginine (hArg) and creatine have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), specifically myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF). The underlying molecular and regulatory mechanisms, however, remain unclear. To identify potential pathways of cardiac AGAT metabolism, we sequenced microRNA (miRNA) in left ventricles of wild-type (wt) compared to AGAT-deficient (AGAT-/-) mice. Using literature search and validation by qPCR, we identified eight significantly regulated miRNAs in AGAT-/- mice linked to atherosclerosis, MI and HF: miR-30b, miR-31, miR-130a, miR-135a, miR-148a, miR-204, miR-298, and let-7i. Analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data confirmed deregulation of these miRNAs in mouse models of MI and HF. Quantification of miRNA expression by qPCR in AGAT-/- mice supplemented with creatine or hArg revealed that miR-30b, miR-31, miR-130a, miR-148a, and miR-204 were regulated by creatine, while miR-135a and miR-298 showed a trend of regulation by hArg. Finally, bioinformatics-based target prediction showed that numerous AGAT-dependent genes previously linked to CVD are likely to be regulated by the identified miRNAs. Taken together, AGAT deficiency and hArg/creatine supplementation are associated with cardiac miRNA expression which may influence cardiac (dys)function and CVD.",-1
Evolution and dispersal of mitochondrial DNA haplogroup U5 in Northern Europe: insights from an unsupervised learning approach to phylogeography,"Background:                    We combined an unsupervised learning methodology for analyzing mitogenome sequences with maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetics to make detailed inferences about the evolution and diversification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup U5, which appears at high frequencies in northern Europe.              Methods:                    Haplogroup U5 mitogenome sequences were gathered from GenBank. The hierarchal Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (hierBAPS) method was used to generate groups of sequences that were then projected onto a rooted maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree to visualize the pattern of clustering. The haplogroup statuses of the individual sequences were assessed using Haplogrep2.              Results:                    A total of 23 hierBAPS groups were identified, all of which corresponded to subclades defined in Phylotree, v.17. The hierBAPS groups projected onto the ML phylogeny accurately clustered all haplotypes belonging to a specific haplogroup in accordance with Haplogrep2. By incorporating the geographic source of each sequence and subclade age estimates into this framework, inferences about the diversification of U5 mtDNAs were made. Haplogroup U5 has been present in northern Europe since the Mesolithic, and spread in both eastern and western directions, undergoing significant diversification within Scandinavia. A review of historical and archeological evidence attests to some of the population interactions contributing to this pattern.              Conclusions:                    The hierBAPS algorithm accurately grouped mitogenome sequences into subclades in a phylogenetically robust manner. This analysis provided new insights into the phylogeographic structure of haplogroup U5 diversity in northern Europe, revealing a detailed perspective on the diversity of subclades in this region and their distribution in Scandinavian populations.",-1
The IL-1 cytokine family as custodians of barrier immunity,"The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family of cytokines and receptors are implicated in the functioning of innate and adaptive immunity and the genesis of inflammation. They are widely expressed in structural and immune cells with marked expression within barrier mucosal surfaces. In the lung, gut and skin, which are common entry sites for pathogens, they play essential functions in maintaining the functional integrity of the barrier and manage innate and adaptive immunity in response to insult and infections. In tissue sites, the IL-1 cytokines are tightly regulated by mechanisms involving decoy receptors and protease degradation. Dysregulation of these processes are associated with aberrant tissue inflammation leading to a number of inflammatory diseases. This review will address the roles of the different IL-1 cytokines at the lung, gut and skin barrier surfaces at homeostasis, and their roles as inflammatory mediators in diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.",-1
[Research advances on the influence of poor dietary habits on the development of keloids],"Long-term poor dietary habits can cause changes in the intestinal flora, resulting in the production of a large number of lipopolysaccharide, increase intestinal mucosal permeability, and activate the entrance of a large number of inflammatory factors into the portal vein. In addition, a high carbohydrate diet can increase liver metabolic burden, increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to oxidative stress, generate new fat during adenosine triphosphate synthesis, and thus resulting in ectopic fat accumulation, which further activate nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling pathway and release inflam- matory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), IL-6, and so on. This leads to obesity and insulin resis- tance, ultimately triggering systemic low-grade inflammation. This article reviews the mechanism of poor dietary habits leading to systemic low-grade inflammation, the clinical and experimental research progress of keloids and systemic low-grade inflammation, the association between dietary habits and keloid constitution, and puts forward the hypothesis that poor dietary habits may lead to the occurrence and development of keloids.",-1
A pilot study of human mesenchymal stem cells from visceral and sub-cutaneous fat tissue and their differentiation to osteogenic phenotype,"Objective:                    To evaluate the different behavior of two different human adult adipocytes derived stem cells (hASCs) during proliferation and osteogenic differentiation.              Patients and methods:                    Human adult adipocytes stem cells (hAT-SCs) from visceral (hAV-SCs) and subcutaneous (hAS-SCs) sites were obtained after surgery procedures of seven patients. All samples were fully investigated and the different proliferation rates were evaluated. All MSCs clusters were cultured with an osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation medium. Homogeneous pools of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) were confirmed by Flow-Cytometry Analysis (FACS) and Spectrophotometric Assay. The differentiated cells were eventually assessed for the expression of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Alizarin Red (AR) and Oil Red-O (OR-O) detection, and analyzed by the Spectrophotometric Assay. After osteogenic differentiation, the cell clusters were incubated and analyzed with Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence microscopy.              Results:                    The FACS analysis performed on hAT-SCs confirmed the homogenous presence of MSCs in all samples. The ALP, AR stain confirmed the osteogenic differentiation capacity of MSCs towards osteoblast-like-cells. The colorimetric cell metabolic activity (MTS) assay showed an increase in the proliferation rate with different values in both sets hAS-SCs vs. hAV-SCs.              Conclusions:                    These in vitro findings of both hAS-SCs and hAV-SCs suggested an important role of these stem cells for future clinical use in bone regeneration. Indeed, the final outcomes suggested a better performance of cells coming from subcutaneous adipose tissue vs. those from visceral fat tissue.",-1
"Self-rated health inequalities in the intersection of gender, social class and regional development in Spain: exploring contributions of material and psychosocial factors","Background:                    Inequalities in health across social class, gender and regional context in Spain are well-known; however, there is a lack of research examining how these dimensions of inequality interact. This study explores self-rated health (SRH) inequalities across intersectional positions of gender, social class and region, and the contribution of material and psychosocial factors to these inequalities.              Methods:                    Participants were drawn from the cross-sectional 2015 National Living Conditions Survey of Spanish residents aged 19-88 years (N = 27,215; 77% response rate). Eight intersectional positions were formed by combining dichotomous variables of gender, social class and regional development. Poisson regression was used to estimate intersectional inequalities in SRH as prevalence ratios, and the contributions of material and psychosocial factors.              Results:                    Results showed both cumulative and heterogeneous inequalities within and across intersectional positions. Inequalities in the intersection of social class and regional development were best explained by the joint contributions of material and psychosocial factors, while gender inequalities within non-manual social class were better explained by material factors alone.              Conclusions:                    The results illustrate the complexity of interacting inequalities in health and their underpinnings in Spain. Local and national policies taking this complexity into account are needed to broadly improve equity in health in Spain.",-1
Photopharmacology of Antimitotic Agents,"Antimitotic agents such as the clinically approved vinca alkaloids, taxanes and epothilone can arrest cell growth during interphase and are therefore among the most important drugs available for treating cancer. These agents suppress microtubule dynamics and thus interfere with intracellular transport, inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell death. Because these drugs target biological processes that are essential to all cells, they face an additional challenge when compared to most other drug classes. General toxicity can limit the applicable dose and therefore reduce therapeutic benefits. Photopharmacology aims to avoid these side-effects by introducing compounds that can be applied globally to cells in their inactive form, then be selectively induced to bioactivity in targeted cells or tissue during a defined time window. This review discusses photoswitchable analogues of antimitotic agents that have been developed by combining different photoswitchable motifs with microtubule-stabilizing or microtubule-destabilizing agents.",-1
Effects of Interval Training on Visceral Adipose Tissue in Centrally Obese 70-Year-Old Individuals: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective:                    To investigate the effects of 10 weeks of progressive vigorous-intensity interval training as a single intervention on body composition among 70-year-old individuals with central obesity.              Design:                    Randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov registration No. NCT03450655).              Setting:                    Community-dwelling 70-year-old men and women living in the UmeÃ¥ municipality in Sweden.              Participants:                    Seventy-seven 70-year-old men and women with central obesity (greater than 1 kg visceral adipose tissue [VAT] for women and greater than 2 kg VAT for men).              Intervention:                    Participants allocated to the intervention group were offered a 10-week progressive concurrent exercise program performed three times per week. All participants in both groups had received tailored lifestyle recommendations focused on diet and physical activity at one occasion within 12 months prior to trial initiation.              Measurements:                    The primary outcome was changes in VAT, and secondary outcomes included changes in total fat mass (FM), total lean body mass (LBM), and body mass index.              Results:                    Comparing the groups, there were no significant differences in decrease of VAT mass (P = .10), although the intervention group significantly decreased FM by 716 g (P = .01) and gained LBM by 508 g (P = .03), compared to the control group. Furthermore, the effects of the training were significantly greater in the male subcohort (P < .05 for interaction), with positive effects also on VAT and FM, where men in the intervention group decreased VAT by 175 g (P < .05) and FM by 1364 g (P = .004), compared to the male controls.              Conclusions:                    The present trial demonstrates that 10 weeks of progressive vigorous interval training is sufficient to significantly decrease FM in older adults with central obesity, with positive effects also on LBM.

Tumor Necrosis Factor-Î±-Induced Protein 8-Like 2 Fosters Tumor-Associated Microbiota to Promote the Development of Colorectal Cancer,"Although increasing evidence links the gut microbiota with the development of colorectal cancer, the molecular mechanisms for microbiota regulation of tumorigenesis are not fully understood. Here, we found that a member of the TNFÎ±-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) family called TIPE2 (TNFAIP8-like 2) was significantly upregulated in murine intestinal tumors and in human colorectal cancer, and colorectal cancer with high expression of Tipe2 mRNA associated with reduced survival time of patients. Consistent with these findings, TIPE2 deficiency significantly inhibited the development of colorectal cancer in mice treated with azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate and in Apcmin/+ mice. TIPE2 deficiency attenuated the severity of colitis by successfully resolving and restricting colonic inflammation and protected colonic myeloid cells from death during colitis. Transplantation of TIPE2-deficient bone marrow into wild-type mice successfully dampened the latter's tumorigenic phenotype, indicating a hematopoietic-specific role for TIPE2. Mechanistically, restricting the expansion of Enterobacteriaceae/Escherichia coli (E. coli) decreased intestinal inflammation and reduced the incidence of colonic tumors. Collectively, these data suggest that hematopoietic TIPE2 regulates intestinal antitumor immunity by regulation of gut microbiota. TIPE2 may represent a new therapeutic target for treating colorectal cancer.",-1
Oxidative modifications of mitochondrial complex II are associated with insulin resistance of visceral fat in obesity,"Obesity, particularly visceral adiposity, has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, which have been suggested as mechanisms of insulin resistance. The mechanism(s) behind this remains incompletely understood. In this study, we hypothesized that mitochondrial complex II dysfunction plays a role in impaired insulin sensitivity in visceral adipose tissue of subjects with obesity. We obtained subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue biopsies from 43 subjects with obesity (body mass index â?30 kg/m2) during planned bariatric surgery. Compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue exhibited decreased complex II activity, which was restored with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (5 mM) ( P < 0.01). A biotin switch assay identified that cysteine oxidative posttranslational modifications (OPTM) in complex II subunit A (succinate dehydrogenase A) were increased in visceral vs. subcutaneous fat ( P < 0.05). Insulin treatment (100 nM) stimulated complex II activity in subcutaneous fat ( P < 0.05). In contrast, insulin treatment of visceral fat led to a decrease in complex II activity ( P < 0.01), which was restored with addition of the mitochondria-specific oxidant scavenger mito-TEMPO (10 ÂµM). In a cohort of 10 subjects with severe obesity, surgical weight loss decreased OPTM and restored complex II activity, exclusively in the visceral depot. Mitochondrial complex II may be an unrecognized and novel mediator of insulin resistance associated with visceral adiposity. The activity of complex II is improved by weight loss, which may contribute to metabolic improvements associated with bariatric surgery.",-1
Novel therapeutic interventions for combating Parkinson's disease and prospects of Nose-to-Brain drug delivery,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder prevalent mainly in geriatric population. While, L-DOPA remains one of the major choices for the therapeutic management of PD, various motor and non-motor manifestations complicate the management of PD. In the last two decades, exhaustive research has been carried out to explore novel therapeutic approaches for mitigating motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. These approaches majorly include receptor-based, anti-inflammatory, stem-cell and nucleic acid based. The major limitations of existing therapeutic interventions (of commonly oral route) are low efficacy due to low brain bioavailability and associated side effects. Nanotechnology has been exploited and has gained wide attention in the recent years as an approach for enhancement of bioavailability of various small molecule drugs in the brain. To address the challenges associated with PD therapy, nose-to-brain delivery utilizing nanomedicine-based approaches has been found to be encouraging in published evidence. Therefore, the present work summarises the major challenges and limitations with antiparkinsonian drugs, novel therapeutic interventions, and scope of nanomedicine-based nose-to-brain delivery in addressing the current challenges of antiparkinsonian therapy. The manuscript tries to sensitize the researchers for designing brain-targeted nanomedicine loaded with natural/synthetic scaffolds, biosimilars, and nucleic acids that can bypass the first-pass effect for the effective management of PD.",-1
"Muscle Fitness to Visceral Fat Ratio, Metabolic Syndrome and Ideal Cardiovascular Health Metrics","This study aimed to investigate the association between the muscle fitness to visceral fat level (MVF) ratio and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics among college students. A total of 1467 young adults recruited from the FUPRECOL study (AsociaciÃ³n de la Fuerza Prensil con Manifestaciones Tempranas de Riesgo Cardiovascular en JÃ³venes y Adultos Colombianos), were categorized into four quartiles based on their MVF ratio. Muscular fitness was assessed using a digital handgrip dynamometer and visceral fat level was determined through bioelectrical impedance analysis. Ideal CVH was assessed, including lifestyle characteristics, anthropometry, blood pressure, and biochemical parameters. The body weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, fat mass index, and visceral fat level were significantly higher in subjects in Q1 (lower MVF ratio) than those in Q2, Q3, or Q4 (p < 0.001). The muscle fitness (handgrip and normalized grip strength (NGS)) of the subjects in Q4 was significantly greater than that of those in Q1 to Q2 (p < 0.001). Subjects with a medium-high MVF ratio (i.e., 3â?th quartiles) had an odds ratio of 2.103 of ideal CVH metrics after adjusting for age, gender, university, and alcohol intake (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.832 to 2.414; p < 0.001). A lower MVF ratio is associated with worse CVH metrics and a higher prevalence of MetS in early adulthood, supporting the hypothesis that the MVF ratio could be used as a complementary screening tool that could help clinicians identify young adults with unfavorable levels of CVH and metabolic risk.",-1
Optimization of proteomics sample preparation for identification of host and bacterial proteins in mouse feces,"Bottom-up proteomics is a powerful method for the functional characterization of mouse gut microbiota. To date, most of the bottom-up proteomics studies of the mouse gut rely on limited amounts of fecal samples. With mass-limited samples, the performance of such analyses is highly dependent on the protein extraction protocols and contaminant removal strategies. Here, protein extraction protocols (using different lysis buffers) and contaminant removal strategies (using different types of filters and beads) were systematically evaluated to maximize quantitative reproducibility and the number of identified proteins. Overall, our results recommend a protein extraction method using a combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and urea in Tris-HCl to yield the greatest number of protein identifications. These conditions led to an increase in the number of proteins identified from gram-positive bacteria, such as Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, which is a challenging task. Our analysis further confirmed these conditions led to the extraction of non-abundant bacterial phyla such as Proteobacteria. In addition, we found that, when coupled to our optimized extraction method, suspension trap (S-Trap) outperforms other contaminant removal methods by providing the most reproducible method while producing the greatest number of protein identifications. Overall, our optimized sample preparation workflow is straightforward and fast, and requires minimal sample handling. Furthermore, our approach does not require high amounts of fecal samples, a vital consideration in proteomics studies where mice produce smaller amounts of feces due to a particular physiological condition. Our final method provides efficient digestion of mouse fecal material, is reproducible, and leads to high proteomic coverage for both host and microbiome proteins.",-1
An investigation of causal relationships between prediabetes and vascular complications,"Prediabetes is a state of glycaemic dysregulation below the diagnostic threshold of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Globally, ~352 million people have prediabetes, of which 35-50% develop full-blown diabetes within five years. T2D and its complications are costly to treat, causing considerable morbidity and early mortality. Whether prediabetes is causally related to diabetes complications is unclear. Here we report a causal inference analysis investigating the effects of prediabetes in coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease, complemented by a systematic review of relevant observational studies. Although the observational studies suggest that prediabetes is broadly associated with diabetes complications, the causal inference analysis revealed that prediabetes is only causally related with coronary artery disease, with no evidence of causal effects on other diabetes complications. In conclusion, prediabetes likely causes coronary artery disease and its prevention is likely to be most effective if initiated prior to the onset of diabetes.",-1
"""Shikonin inhibits microglia activation and reduces CFA-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in an animal model of pain""","Shikonin is an ointment produced from Lithospermun erythrorhizon which has been used in traditional medicine both in Europe and Asia for wound healing and is associated with anti-inflammatory properties. The goal of this work is to assess the analgesic properties of Shikonin in the CFA-induced inflammation model of pain. Rats were subjected to inflammation of the hind paw by CFA injection with a preventive injection of Shikonin and compared to either a control group or to a CFA-inflamed group with the vehicle drug solution. Inflammation of the hind paw by CFA was assessed by measurement of the dorsal to plantar diameter. Mechanical thresholds were established by means of the Von Frey filaments which are calibrated filaments that exert a defined force. Finally, the spinal cord of the studied animals was extracted to analyse the microglia population through immunohistochemistry using the specific marker Iba-1. Our results show that Shikonin reduces the paw oedema caused by CFA inflammation. Subsequently, there is a concomitant restoration of the mechanical thresholds reduced by CFA hind paw injection. Additionally, spinal microglia is activated after CFA-induced inflammation. Our results show that microglia is inhibited by Shikonin and has concomitant restoration of the mechanical thresholds. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that Shikonin inhibits microglia morphological changes and thereby ameliorates pain-like behaviour elicited by mechanical stimulation.",-1
Î±-Synuclein interacts differently with membranes mimicking the inner and outer leaflets of neuronal membranes,"The toxicity of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn), the amyloidogenic protein responsible for Parkinson's disease, is likely related to its interaction with the asymmetric neuronal membrane. Î±-Syn exists as cytoplasmatic and as extracellular protein as well. To shed light on the different interactions occurring at the different Î±-syn localizations, we have here modelled the external and internal membrane leaflets of the neuronal membrane with two complex lipid mixtures, characterized by phase coexistence and with negative charge confined to either the ordered or the disordered phase, respectively. To this purpose, we selected a five-component (DOPC/SM/DOPE/DOPS/chol) and a four-component (DOPC/SM/GM1/chol) lipid mixtures, which contained the main membrane lipid constituents and exhibited a phase separation with formation of ordered domains. We have compared the action of Î±-syn in monomeric form and at different concentrations (1 nM, 40 nM, and 200 nM) with respect to lipid systems with different composition and shape by AFM, QCM-D, and vesicle leakage experiments. The experiments coherently showed a higher stability of the membranes composed by the internal leaflet mixture to the interaction with Î±-syn. Damage to membranes made of the external leaflet mixture was detected in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, the membrane damage was related to the fluidity of the lipid domains and not to the presence of negatively charged lipids.",-1
"Vinpocetine ameliorates developmental hyperserotonemia induced behavioral and biochemical changes: role of neuronal function, inflammation, and oxidative stress","Hyperserotonemia, during the early developmental phase, generates behavioral and biochemical phenotypes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in rats. Phosphodiesteraseâ? (PDE1) inhibitors are known to provide benefits in various brain conditions. We investigated the role of a selective PDE1 inhibitor, vinpocetine on ASDârelated behavioral phenotypes (social behavioral deficits, repetitive behavior, anxiety, and hyperlocomotion) in a developmental hyperserotonemia (DHS) rat model. Also, effects on biochemical markers related with neuronal function brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB), inflammation interleukins (ILâ? and ILâ?0) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFâÎ?, and oxidative stress (TBARS and GSH) were studied in important brain areas (frontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum). Administration of 5âmethoxytryptamine (5âMT) to rats prenatally (gestational day 12) and in early developmental stages postnatal day (PND 0 - PND 20), resulted in impaired behavior and brain biochemistry. Administration of vinpocetine daily (10 and 20 mg/kg) to 5âMT rats from PND 21 to PND 48 resulted in an improvement of behavioral deficits. Also, vinpocetine administration significantly increased the levels of BDNF, ratio of pCREB/ CREB, ILâ?0, and GSH, and significantly decreased TNFâÎ? ILâ?, and TBARS levels in different brain areas. Finally, our correlation analysis indicated that behavioral outcomes were significantly associated with the biochemical outcome. Vinpocetine, a selective PDE1 inhibitor, rectified important behavioral phenotypes related with ASD, possibly by improving markers of neuronal function, brain inflammation, and brain oxidative stress. Thus, PDE1 could be a potential target for pharmacological interventions and furthering our understanding of ASD pathogenesis.",-1
Predictors for mortality in patients admitted with suspected bacterial infections - A prospective long-term follow-up study,"Objective:                    The aim was to examine predictors for all-cause mortality in a long-term follow-up study of adult patients with infectious diseases of suspected bacterial origin.              Methods:                    A prospective observational study of patients admitted to the emergency department during 1.10.2017-31.03.2018. We used Cox regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals for mortality.              Results:                    A total of 2110 patients were included (median age 73 years). After a median follow-up of 2.1 years 758 (35.9%, 95% CI 33.9-38.0%) patients had died. Age (aHR1.05; 1.04-1.05), male gender (aHR 1.21; 1.17-1.25), cancer (aHR 1.80; 1.73-1.87), misuse of alcohol (aHR 1.30; 1.22-1.38), if admitted with sepsis within the last year before index admission (aHR 1.56;1.50-1.61), a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score â? (aHR 1.90; 1.83-1.98), SIRS criteria â? (aHR 1.23;1.18-1.28) at admission to the ED, length of stay (aHR 1.05; 1.04-1.05) and devices and implants as sources of infection (aHR 7.0; 5.61-8.73) were independently associated with mortality. Skin infections and increasing haemoblobin values reduced the risk of death.              Conclusions:                    More than one-third of a population of patients admitted to the emergency department with infectious diseases of suspected bacterial origin had died during a median follow up of 2.1 years. The study identified several independent predictors for mortality.",-1
"The Use of Frozen, Food-Grade Blood to Successfully Maintain Colonies of Four Species of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae)","An essential component of all mosquito-rearing activities is the act of blood-feeding the mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). Many options exist for this purpose including live host animals and a diverse array of artificial-feeding methods. Most of the published artificial-feeding methods involve expensive materials, custom-built devices, or are labor-intensive. All of the previously published methods utilize blood sources, which are either expensive, or difficult to obtain. Additionally, much of the research into artificial blood-feeding methods for mosquitoes has focused on two species: Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse). This article presents a modified artificial blood-feeding method that uses affordable and easily sourced materials, does not require any technical knowledge to assemble, and requires minimal time and effort. The combination of inexpensive aluminum plates, Parafilm and polytetrafluoroethylene tape membranes, an electric germination mat, and frozen, food-grade blood produces exceptional feeding rates and abundant egg production. The method has been used for 2 yr at the Lee County Mosquito Control District to successfully maintain laboratory colonies of four species of mosquito: Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Aedes taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann), and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). Variations of this method are reported, which can be used for wild and laboratory colonies of multiple species. This modified method is highly accessible for any small-scale mosquito rearing facility with labor or budgetary constraints.",-1
Effects of intermittent fasting diets on plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Intermittent fasting (IF) and energy-restricted diets (ERDs) have emerged as dietary approaches to decrease inflammatory status; however, there are no consistent results regarding humans. To achieve a comprehensive conclusion, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of IF or ERDs on plasma concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers. We systematically searched online medical databases including Web of Sciences, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar up to June 2019. Evaluations of effect sizes were described employing in weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals from the random-effects model. Eighteen eligible RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimation from the random-effect model showed that IF regimens and ERDs significantly reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations (WMD: -0.024 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.044 to -0.005, I2 = 7.0%). Additionally, IF regimens (WMD: -0.029; 95% CI: -0.058 to -0.000, I2 = 17.9%) were more effective in reducing CRP levels than ERDs (WMD: -0.001 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.037 to 0.034, I2 = 0.0%). Moreover, based on the treatment duration and types of the studies' population, a greater reduction was observed in overweight and obese individuals (WMD: -0.03 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.01, I2 = 42.1%), and in treatment duration â? wk (WMD: -0.03 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.01, I2 = 0.0%) as well. However, IF and ERDs did not significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-Î± (WMD: -0.158 pg/mL; P = 0.549, I2 = 98.3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations (WMD: -0.541 pg/mL; P = 0.080, I2 = 94.7%). This meta-analysis demonstrated that IF regimens and ERDs may reduce CRP concentrations, particularly in overweight and obese individuals and through a considerable length of intervention (â? mo). However, neither dietary model affected the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-Î± or interleukin-6.",-1
"Circular RNA LONP2 regulates proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells by sponging microRNA-584-5p","Bladder cancer (BC) is the most frequent type of urinary tumor and a barely treatable disease. Although extensive efforts have been invested in the research of BC, the underlying etiology and pathophysiology remain unclear. CircLONP2 is a circular RNA implicated in the development of many cancers, and miR-584-5p and YAP1 have been reported to contribute to the progression of BC. In this research, we presented novel evidence supporting circLONP2/miR-584-5p/YAP1 axis as a novel regulatory module in the progression of BC. We analyzed the expression of circLONP2 between precancerous BC samples and normal tissues using a published RNA-seq dataset. The expression of circLONP2 was also validated in clinical samples and cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and miRNA inhibitor was utilized to modulate the expression of circLONP2 and miR-584-5p and investigate their functions on cell proliferation and invasion. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down were performed to confirm the functional interactions among circLONP2/miR-584-5p/YAP1. CircLONP2 was significantly upregulated in precancerous BC tissues and BC cells. CircLONP2 depletion inhibited cell viability, proliferation, and invasion of BC cell lines, which could be partially rescued by miR-584-5p inhibitor. Further experiments indicated that miR-584-5p regulates cell viability, proliferation, and invasion via directly targeting YAP1. In summary, our work indicates that circLONP2 plays an oncogenic function in BC by regulating miR-584-5p/YAP1 axis, and its interaction with miR-584-5p provides a potential strategy to target BC.",-1
"Recent Experimental Studies of Maternal Obesity, Diabetes during Pregnancy and the Developmental Origins of Cardiovascular Disease","Globally, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death. Most concerning is the rise in cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, diabetes and hypertension among youth, which increases the likelihood of the development of earlier and more severe cardiovascular disease. While lifestyle factors are involved in these trends, an increasing body of evidence implicates environmental exposures in early life on health outcomes in adulthood. Maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy, which have increased dramatically in recent years, also have profound effects on fetal growth and development. Mounting evidence is emerging that maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy have lifelong effects on cardiovascular risk factors and heart disease development. However, the mechanisms responsible for these observations are unknown. In this review, we summarize the findings of recent experimental studies, showing that maternal obesity and diabetes during pregnancy affect energy metabolism and heart disease development in the offspring, with a focus on the mechanisms involved. We also evaluate early proof-of-concept studies for interventions that could mitigate maternal obesity and gestational diabetes-induced cardiovascular disease risk in the offspring.",-1
Duodenal adipose tissue is associated with obesity in baboons (Papio sp): a novel site of ectopic fat deposition in non-human primates,"Aims:                    Ectopic fat is a recognized contributor to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction, while the role of fat deposition inside intestinal wall tissue remains understudied. We undertook this study to directly quantify and localize intramural fat deposition in duodenal tissue and determine its association with adiposity.              Methods:                    Duodenal tissues were collected from aged (21.2 Â± 1.3 years, 19.5 Â± 3.1 kg, n = 39) female baboons (Papio sp.). Fasted blood was collected for metabolic profiling and abdominal circumference (AC) measurements were taken. Primary tissue samples were collected at the major duodenal papilla at necropsy: one full cross section was processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining and evaluated; a second full cross section was processed for direct chemical lipid analysis on which percentage duodenal fat content was calculated.              Results:                    Duodenal fat content obtained by direct tissue quantification showed considerable variability (11.95 Â± 6.93%) and was correlated with AC (r = 0.60, p < 0.001), weight (r = 0.38, p = 0.02), leptin (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), adiponectin (r = - 0.32, p < 0.05), and triglyceride (r = 0.41, p = 0.01). The relationship between duodenal fat content and leptin remained after adjusting for body weight and abdominal circumference. Intramural adipocytes were found in duodenal sections from all animals and were localized to the submucosa. Consistent with the variation in tissue fat content, the submucosal adipocytes were non-uniformly distributed in clusters of varying size. Duodenal adipocytes were larger in obese vs. lean animals (106.9 vs. 66.7 Âµm2, p = 0.02).              Conclusions:                    Fat accumulation inside the duodenal wall is strongly associated with adiposity and adiposity related circulating biomarkers in baboons. Duodenal tissue fat represents a novel and potentially metabolically active site of ectopic fat deposition.",-1
The role of noncoding RNAs in Parkinson's disease: biomarkers and associations with pathogenic pathways,"The discovery of various noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and their biological implications is a growing area in cell biology. Increasing evidence has revealed canonical and noncanonical functions of long and small ncRNAs, including microRNAs, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs, and tRNA-derived fragments. These ncRNAs have the ability to regulate gene expression and modify metabolic pathways. Thus, they may have important roles as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, especially Parkinson's disease. Recently, through diverse sequencing technologies and a wide variety of bioinformatic analytical tools, such as reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR, microarrays, next-generation sequencing and long-read sequencing, numerous ncRNAs have been shown to be associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. In this review article, we will first introduce the biogenesis of different ncRNAs, including microRNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs, circular RNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and tRNA-derived fragments. The pros and cons of the detection platforms of ncRNAs and the reproducibility of bioinformatic analytical tools will be discussed in the second part. Finally, the recent discovery of numerous PD-associated ncRNAs and their association with the diagnosis and pathophysiology of PD are reviewed, and microRNAs and long ncRNAs that are transported by exosomes in biofluids are particularly emphasized.",-1
Network Intrusion Detection Method Combining CNN and BiLSTM in Cloud Computing Environment,"A network intrusion detection method combining CNN and BiLSTM network is proposed. First, the KDD CUP 99 data set is preprocessed by using data extraction algorithm. The data set is transformed into image data set by data cleaning, data extraction, and data mapping; Second, CNN is used to extract the parallel local features of attribute information, and BiLSTM is used to extract the features of long-distance-dependent information, so as to fully consider the influence between the front and back attribute information, and attention mechanism is introduced to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, C5.0 decision tree and CNN BiLSTM deep learning model are combined to skip the design feature selection and directly use deep learning model to learn the representational features of high-dimensional data. Experimental results show that, compared with the methods based on AE-AlexNet and SGM-CNN, the network intrusion detection effect of this method is better, the average accuracy can be improved to 95.50%, the false-positive rate can be reduced to 4.24%, and the false positive rate can be reduced to 6.66%. The proposed method can significantly improve the performance of network intrusion detection system.",-1
"Curcumin for parkinsonÂ´s disease: potential therapeutic effects, molecular mechanisms, and nanoformulations to enhance its efficacy","Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide. It is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra pars compacta. This neuronal loss causes the dopamine deficiency that leads to a series of functional changes within the basal ganglia, producing motor control abnormalities. L-DOPA is considered the gold standard for PD treatment, and it may alleviate its clinical manifestations for some time. However, its prolonged administration produces tolerance and several severe side effects, including dyskinesias and gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, there is an urgent need to find effective medications, and current trends have proposed some natural products as emerging options for this purpose. Concerning this, curcumin represents a promising bioactive compound with high therapeutic potential. Diverse studies in cellular and animal models have suggested that curcumin could be employed for the treatment of PD. Therefore, the objective of this narrative mini-review is to present an overview of the possible therapeutic effects of curcumin and the subjacent molecular mechanisms. Moreover, we describe several possible nanocarrier-based approaches to improve the bioavailability of curcumin and enhance its biological activity.",-1
A Brewed Awakening: Neuropsychiatric Effects of Caffeine in Older Adults,"This article provides a current review of the literature examining caffeine use in older adults. Caffeine use is prevalent among older adults; thus, providers need to be aware of the prevalence and diagnostic criteria of caffeine use disorder versus nonproblematic use. The relationship between caffeine and various neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, insomnia, and late-life depression, is reviewed. The neurobiological effects of caffeine are described, along with clinically relevant interactions between caffeine and common psychotropic medications.",-1
MicroRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of Pinus pinaster response and resistance to pinewood nematode,"Pine wilt disease (PWD), caused by the parasitic nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, or pinewood nematode (PWN), is a serious threat to pine forests in Europe. Pinus pinaster is highly susceptible to the disease and it is currently the most affected European pine species. In this work, we investigated the role of small RNAs (sRNAs) in regulating P. pinaster-PWN interaction in an early stage of infection. After performing an artificial PWN inoculation assay, we have identified 105 plant microRNAs (miRNAs) responsive to PWN. Based on their predicted targets, part of these miRNAs was associated with roles in jasmonate-response pathway, ROS detoxification, and terpenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, by comparing resistant and susceptible plants, eight miRNAs with putative functions in plant defence and resistance to PWN have been identified. Finally, we explored the possibility of bidirectional trans-kingdom RNA silencing, identifying several P. pinaster genes putatively targeted by PWN miRNAs, which was supported by degradome analysis. Targets for P. pinaster miRNAs were also predicted in PWN, suggesting a role for trans-kingdom miRNA transfer and gene silencing both in PWN parasitism as in P. pinaster resistance to PWD. Our results provide new insights into previously unexplored roles of sRNA post-transcriptional regulation in P. pinaster response and resistance to PWN.",-1
Artificial intelligence-assisted development of in situ forming nanoparticles for arthritis therapy via intra-articular delivery,"Intra-articular (IA) injection is grasping much interest due to the poor drug bioavailability at the targeted site of action which minimizes the effect of the orally administered moiety. Based on the integral role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), much effort is exerted to develop novel localized drug delivery systems to increase their bioavailability and minimize their side effects. Artificial intelligence (AI) is acquiring an increasing role in the design of experiments being an effective tool for saving both time and resources. Hence, the aim of this work was to develop, characterize and optimize targeted in-situ forming nano particles (ISNs) for IA delivery of piroxicam using DesignÂ® Expert as an AI-based application where a 33 full factorial experimental design was adopted. Morphological investigation, injectability, rheological studies, Fourier Transform Infrared Radiation (FTIR) as well as biological, histopathological, and biochemical examinations were performed to evaluate the optimized-ISNs. The optimized formulation, exhibiting a nano-sized particle size with a dense core, showed significant improvement in the histopathological findings compared to both the oral solution and the placebo. Additionally, the once-a-week IA administration of the optimized-ISNs proved a significant reduction in the protein expression of both STAT-3 and RANKL and the levels of anti-CCP and MCP-1 by almost 54 and 73%, respectively, coupled with a marked decline in the content of IL-17, MMP-3, NF-ÎºB and TNF-Î± as compared to the positive control. In conclusion, the use of ISNs for intra-articular injection has demonstrated their effectiveness in piroxicam delivery for RA treatment.",-1
Locomotor activity in Aedes aegypti with different insecticide resistance profiles,"Objective:                    To evaluate locomotor activity in four field populations of Ae. aegypti with different insecticide resistance profiles from the state of SÃ£o Paulo for two years.              Methods:                    This study comprised the susceptible Rockefeller strain and four populations from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil: two considered populations with ""reduced susceptibility"" to pyrethroids (Campinas and MarÃ­lia), and two ""resistant populations"" (Santos and RibeirÃ£o Preto). First, 2016 and 2017 eggs from these five populations were hatched in laboratory. Virgin females underwent experiments under laboratory conditions at 25Â°C, with 12:12h light/dark (LD) photoperiod; 24-hour individual activity was recorded using a locomotor activity monitor (LAM).              Results:                    In females from 2016 field populations, both resistant populations showed significant more locomotor activity than the two reduced susceptibility populations and the Rockefeller strain (p < 0.05). As for females from 2017 field populations, reduced susceptibility populations showed a significant increased locomotor activity than the Rockefeller strain, but no significant difference when compared to Santos resistant population (p > 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Our results indicate that insecticide-resistant Ae. aegypti populations show increased locomotor activity, which may affect the transmission dynamics of their arboviruses.",-1
Knockdown of circ-PRKCH alleviates IL-1Î²-treated chondrocyte cell phenotypic changes through modulating miR-502-5p/ADAMTS5 axis,"Background:                    Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease characterized by progressive cartilage degradation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the initiation and development of OA. This study aimed to explore the potential role and mechanism of circRNA protein kinase C eta (circ-PRKCH) in OA.              Methods:                    A total of 30 cartilage specimens were collected from OA patients or normal subjects. Human chondrocytes (CHON-001) were stimulated with interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) to establish an in vitro OA model. The expression levels of circ-PRKCH, microRNA-502-5p (miR-502-5p) and circ-PRKCH or A disintegrin and metalloproteases metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in cartilage specimens and IL-1Î²-treated chondrocytes were detected by quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot, and their correlation in OA cartilage specimens was analysed by Spearman's correlation coefficient. The targeted relationship between miR-502-5p and circ-PRKCH or ADAMTS5 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU), flow cytometry, wound healing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were applied to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and inflammatory response in IL-1Î²-treated chondrocytes. Exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Western blot.              Results:                    Circ-PRKCH and ADAMTS5 expression levels were up-regulated, while miR-502-5p expression was down-regulated in OA cartilage tissues and IL-1Î²-treated chondrocytes. Depletion of circ-PRKCH relieved IL-1Î²-treated chondrocyte cell phenotypic changes by promoting cell proliferation and migration, as well as inhibiting apoptosis and inflammatory response. Mechanically, circ-PRKCH acted as a sponge for miR-502-5p to regulate ADAMTS5 expression, thereby contributing to IL-1Î²-treated chondrocyte cell phenotypic changes. Moreover, exosomes derived from IL-1Î²-treated chondrocytes could transfer circ-PRKCH across cells.              Conclusion:                    Circ-PRKCH contributed to IL-1Î²-treated cell phenotypic changes in chondrocytes via modulating miR-502-5p/ADAMTS5 pathway, which might provide a promising biomarker for OA treatment.",-1
[Development and thoughts of digestive endoscopy in children],"After nearly 40 years of development, digestive endoscopy in children has been widely applied, and it has helped to expand the spectrum of pediatric digestive system diseases and greatly improve the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric digestive system diseases. Pediatric digestive endoscopy has become a subject. However, there are some problems such as the unbalanced development of pediatric digestive endoscopy across China, the lack of homogeneity in diagnosis and treatment system, the tendency of adult-oriented diagnosis and treatment techniques, and the localization of training quality, which affect the standardized and healthy development of pediatric digestive endoscopy. The diagnosis and treatment with digestive endoscopy in children should adhere to both pediatric characteristics and technological innovation to propose the concept of comfort, emphasize the importance of standardization (including the space and process for endoscopic diagnosis and treatment, perioperative evaluation, training mode, and access qualification), standardize the minimally invasive techniques, and develop artificial intelligence. It is of great importance to formulate related consensus statements and guidelines on the basis of medical safety and the features of the growth and development of children, so as to achieve the high-quality development of pediatric digestive endoscopy, effectively improve the diagnosis and treatment levels of pediatric digestive endoscopy, and bring benefits to more pediatric patients.",-1
"The hidden universe of human milk microbiome: origin, composition, determinants, role, and future perspectives","Although traditionally considered sterile, human milk is currently recognized as an alive ecosystem that harbors not only bacteria, but also viruses, fungi and yeasts, and minor genera, collectively known as the human milk microbiome (HMM). The seeding of HMM is a complex phenomenon whose dynamics are still a matter of research. Many factors contribute to its determination, both maternal, neonatal, environmental, and related to human milk itself. The transmission of microorganisms to the infant through breastfeeding may impact its present and future health, mainly shaping the GI tract microbiome and immune system. The existence and persistence of HMM as a conserved feature among different species may also have an evolutionary meaning, which will become apparent only in evolutionary times.              Conclusion:                    The complexities of HMM warrant further research in order to deepen our knowledge on its origin, determinants, and impact on infants' health. The practical and translational implications of research on HMM (e.g., reconstitution of donor human milk through inoculation of infant's own mother milk, modulation of HMM through maternal dietary supplementation) should not be overlooked.              What is known:                    â?Human milk harbors a wide variety of microorganisms, ranging from bacteria to viruses, fungi and yeasts, and minor genera. â?Human milk microbiome is shaped over time by many factors: maternal, neonatal, environmental, and related to human milk itself. â?The transmission of microorganisms through breastfeeding may impact the infant's present and future health.              What is new:                    â?We provide an overview on human milk microbiome, hopefully encouraging physicians to consider it among the other better-known breastfeeding benefits. â?Further studies, with standardized and rigorous study designs to enhance accuracy and reproducibility of the results, are needed to deepen our knowledge of the human milk microbiota and its role in newborn and infant's health.",-1
Body Composition and Visceral Adipose Tissue in Female Collegiate Equestrian Athletes,"To examine measures of total and regional body composition using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in NCAA Division I collegiate equestrian athletes, 31 female collegiate equestrian athletes were matched to a population of normal controls by age and body mass index. Total and regional fat tissue mass (FM), lean tissue mass (LM), bone mineral density (BMD), and abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were measured by DXA. Equestrian athletes had a significantly (p=0.03) lower total body fat percentage (%fat) than controls. There were no significant differences in total LM and VAT between equestrian athletes and controls. However, equestrian athletes, when compared to the controls, had significantly lower leg %fat, leg FM and higher leg LM. The greater leg LM in equestrian riders resulted in a smaller upper to lower body LM ratio compared to controls. There was no difference in leg BMD between equestrian athletes and controls. There were no significant differences between the 2 styles of riding (i. e., hunt seat and western style) in regards to body composition. The lower total %fat in equestrian athletes seems to be influenced by differences in leg composition, with equestrian athletes having significantly more LM and less FM.",-1
Reliable reference genes for expression analysis of proliferating and adipogenically differentiating human adipose stromal cells,"Background:                    The proliferation and adipogenic differentiation of adipose stromal cells (ASCs) are complex processes comprising major phenotypical alterations driven by up- and downregulation of hundreds of genes. Quantitative RT-PCR can be employed to measure relative changes in the expression of a gene of interest. This approach requires constitutively expressed reference genes for normalization to counteract inter-sample variations due to differences in RNA quality and quantity. Thus, a careful validation of quantitative RT-PCR reference genes is needed to accurately measure fluctuations in the expression of genes. Here, we evaluated candidate reference genes applicable for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression during proliferation and adipogenesis of human ASCs with the immunophenotype DLK1+/CD34+/CD90+/CD105+/CD45-/CD31-.              Methods:                    We evaluated the applicability of 10 candidate reference genes (GAPDH, TBP, RPS18, EF1A, TFRC, GUSB, PSMD5, CCNA2, LMNA and MRPL19) using NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper software.              Results:                    The results indicate that EF1A and MRPL19 are the most reliable reference genes for quantitative RT-PCR analysis of proliferating ASCs. PSMD5 serves as the most reliable endogenous control in adipogenesis. CCNA2 and LMNA were among the least consistent genes.              Conclusions:                    Applying these findings for future gene expression analyses will help elucidate ASC biology.",-1
Selective induction of human gut-associated acetogenic/butyrogenic microbiota based on specific microbial colonization of indigestible starch granules,"Prediction of individualized responses is one of biggest challenges in dietary intervention to modulate human gut microbiota. Bacterial interspecies competition for dietary factors should underlie the inter-subject heterogeneity of microbial responses. Microscale localization of bacterial species around intestinal food structures could provide direct evidence for understanding this, however, little information is currently available. Here we analyzed human fecal sections and found multiple types of bacterial colonization of food structures. The most eminent one was dense and frequent colonization of starch granules by Bifidobacterium adolescentis. After intake of raw potato starch (pSt), B. adolescentis dramatically increased in every carrier of the species, accompanied by an increase in bifidobacterial metabolite acetate. In the other subjects, Eubacterium rectale and its metabolite butyrate increased, but it was suppressed in B. adolescentis carriers. A correlation analysis indicated the contribution of these species to respective metabolites. In vitro analyses of isolates of major gut bacterial species confirmed that these species are major colonizers of pSt and that B. adolescentis can colonize pSt even in the presence of the known starch granule-degrading bacterium Ruminococcus bromii. Collectively, we propose that specific binding of B. adolescentis or E. rectale to pSt selectively induces acetogenic or butyrogenic response of gut microbiota, where the former determines the response of the latter.",-1
Lay A TRAP for myeloid cell response in diabetic kidney disease,"The functions of the renin-angiotensin system are crucial in the progression of diabetic kidney disease. ATRAP is a type 1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein that negatively regulates intracellular angiotensin II signaling. In this issue, Haruhara et al. revealed that ATRAP deficiency of diabetic mice decreases anti-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and exacerbates albuminuria. The adoptive transfer and tubule-specific depletion of ATRAP highlight the crosstalk between glomerular injury and tubulointerstitial angiotensin II signaling and innate immunity.",-1
Effects of a posture shirt with back active correction keeper on static and dynamic balance in Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from postural disorders. This study aims at investigating the short- and medium-term effects of a shirt with appropriate tie-rods that allows to correct the posture of the trunk.              Methods:                    This is a longitudinal clinical study in which a pressure platform was used to assess the static and dynamic baropodometry and the static stabilometry of 20 patients with PD (70.95 Â± 8.39 years old; 13 males, time from the onset of symptoms: 6.95 Â± 4.04 years, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score: UPDRS = 7.25 Â± 6.26) without and with a shirt, specifically designed for improving posture, at baseline and after one month of wearing.              Results:                    The results showed a significant improvement in symmetry of loads (p = 0.015) and an enlargement of the foot contact surface (p = 0.038). A significant correlation was found between the change in forefoot load and time spent daily in wearing the shirt (R = 0.575, p = 0.008), with an optimal value identified at 8 h per day.              Conclusion:                    The use of a postural shirt in patients with PD symmetrized the postural load and enlarged the foot contact surface improving their balance.",-1
Ganluyin ameliorates DSS-induced ulcerative colitis by inhibiting the enteric-origin LPS/TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway,"Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), that is associated with a significantly increased risk of colon cancer. As a classic traditional Chinese medicine, Ganluyin (GLY) has a long history as an anti-inflammatory medication, but its impacts on UC has not been established.              Aim of the study:                    This study aims to evaluate the protective effect and mechanism of GLY on a pathway involving enteric-origin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), toll-like receptor (TLR)4, and NF-ÎºB in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC.              Materials and methods:                    After three weeks of intragastric administration of GLY, a UC model was induced in mice by administration of 4% DSS in drinking water for one week. The disease activity index (DAI) was measured, and histological staining was used to detect histopathological changes of colon. LPS content of the serum was measured by ELISA, and the expression of tight junction proteins and proteins related to TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway in colon were analyzed by immunohistochemistry or Western Blotting. The intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.              Results:                    GLY improved the histological pathological changes of DSS-induced UC, as assessed by DAI, colonic mucosal damage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and goblet cell and mucus reduction. GLY also protected the intestinal mucosal barrier by increasing the expression of the tight junction proteins, occludin, claudin-1, and ZO-1 and by reducing the serum LPS content and decreasing the expression of TLR4, MyD88, NF-ÎºB, IL-6, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î± proteins in colon. Analyses of the intestinal flora showed that GLY restored the homeostasis of the intestinal flora through increases in the abundance of Firmicutes and decreases in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, which is associated with the production of LPS.              Conclusion:                    GLY might exert an anti-UC effect by improving the colonic mucosal barrier and inhibiting the enteric-origin LPS/TLR4/NF-ÎºB inflammatory pathway, and restoring the homeostasis of the intestinal flora in UC mice. These discoveries lay a strong foundation for GLY as a UC treatment.",-1
Insecticidal and Attractant Activities of Magnolia citrata Leaf Essential Oil against Two Major Pests from Diptera: Aedes aegypti (Culicidae) and Ceratitis capitata (Tephritidae),"In this study, Magnolia citrata Noot and Chalermglin (Magnoliaceae) essential oil (MCEO) was evaluated for insecticidal activity against the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti and attractant activity for the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. The leaves of Magnolia citrata (Giá»i chanh) were collected from northwestern Vietnam, and the water-distilled MCEO was analyzed by gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major constituents of MCEO were identified as linalool 19%, geranial 16%, citronellal 14%, neral 14%, and sabinene 12%. MCEO showed 100% mortality at 1 Î¼g/Î¼L against 1st instar larvae of Ae. aegypti (Orlando strain, ORL), and the oil exhibited 54% (ORL) and 68% (Puerto Rico strain) mortality at 5 Î¼g/mosquito against Ae. aegypti adult females. Initial screens showed that MCEO had weak insecticidal activity compared to the positive control permethrin. In bioassays with sterile male C. capitata, MCEO exhibited moderately strong attraction, comparable to that observed with a positive control, Tetradenia riparia essential oil (TREO). Herein, the insecticidal and attractant activities of MCEO are reported for the first time.",-1
Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases-coordinated Multicountry Study to Determine the Burden and Causes of Residual Malaria Across Different Regions,"The burden and causes of residual malaria were investigated between 2015 and 2019 through 5 research projects coordinated by the Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), cosponsored by the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF, the World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the WHO Global Malaria Programme. The 5 projects included 10 countries in 4 WHO regions: Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific. The countries represented a range of malaria endemicities, from low to high levels of transmission. The main findings of the projects indicate that overall the core malaria vector control tools (long-lasting insecticidal nets [LLIN] and indoor residual spraying) were not deployed in the optimal way and/or not efficient in many settings of the supported projects. Furthermore, vector biting behavior and human activity-associated factors strongly contributed to malaria persistence. Changes in vector species composition and abundance, with an increase in outdoor biting, were also reported. Some of these factors may be an adaptation of the vectors to the deployment of the tools and/or can be linked to other sectors, such as agricultural practices, environmental changes, social factors, and water management. Human behaviors and sleeping habits that included activities and sleeping outside villages in unprotected dwellings were another part of the problem. The evidence collated demonstrates the need for new approaches, such as the multisectoral one and new vector control tools, all adapted to the local contexts and integrated into current malaria programs.",-1
The Advances in Epigenetics for Cancer Radiotherapy,"Cancer is an important factor threatening human life and health; in recent years, its morbidity and mortality remain high and demosntrate an upward trend. It is of great significance to study its pathogenesis and targeted therapy. As the complex mechanisms of epigenetic modification has been increasingly discovered, they are more closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer. As a reversible response, epigenetic modification is of great significance for the improvement of classical therapeutic measures and the discovery of new therapeutic targets. It has become a research focusto explore the multi-level mechanisms of RNA, DNA, chromatin and proteins. As an important means of cancer treatment, radiotherapy has made great progress in technology, methods, means and targeted sensitization after years of rapid development, and even research on radiotherapy based on epigenetic modification is rampant. A series of epigenetic effects of radiation on DNA methylation, histone modification, chromosome remodeling, RNA modification and non-coding RNA during radiotherapy affects the therapeutic effects and prognosis. Starting from the epigenetic mechanism of tumorigenesis, this paper reviews the latest progress in the mechanism of interaction between epigenetic modification and cancer radiotherapy and briefly introduces the main types, mechanisms and applications of epigenetic modifiers used for radiotherapy sensitization in order to explore a more individual and dynamic approach of cancer treatment based on epigenetic mechanism. This study strives to make a modest contribution to the progress of human disease research.",-1
Treatment of Early-Stage Gynecological Cancer-Related Lower Limb Lymphedema by Lymphaticovenular Anastomosis-The Triple Incision Approach,"Background and Objectives: Lower extremity lymphedema (LEL) is one of the most relevant chronic and disabling sequelae after gynecological cancer therapy involving pelvic lymphadenectomy (PL). Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) is a safe and effective procedure to treat LEL, particularly indicated in early-stage cases when conservative therapies are insufficient to control the swelling. Usually, preoperative assessment of these patients shows patent and peristaltic lymphatic vessels that can be mapped throughout the limb to plan the sites of skin incision to perform LVA. The aim of this study is to report the efficacy of our approach based on planning LVA in three areas of the lower limb in improving early-stage gynecological cancer-related lymphedema (GCRL) secondary to PL. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients who underwent LVA for the treatment of early-stage GCRL following PL. Patients who had undergone groin dissection were excluded. Our preoperative study based on indocyanine green lymphography (ICG-L) and color doppler ultrasound (CDU) planned three incision sites located in the groin, in the medial surface of the distal third of the thigh, and in the upper half of the leg, to perform LVA. The primary outcome measure was the variation of the mean circumference of the limb after surgery. The changes between preoperative and postoperative limbs' measures were analyzed by Student's t-test. p values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Results: Thirty-three patients were included. In every patient, three incision sites were employed to perform LVA. A total of 119 LVA were established, with an average of 3.6 for each patient. The mean circumference of the operated limb showed a significant reduction after surgery, decreasing from 37 cm Â± 4.1 cm to 36.1 cm Â± 4.4 (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Our results suggest that in patients affected by early-stage GCRL secondary to PL, the placement of incision sites in all the anatomical subunits of the lower limb is one of the key factors in achieving good results after LVA.",-1
Guaico Culex virus NSP2 has RNA helicase and chaperoning activities,"RNA-remodelling proteins, including RNA helicases and chaperones, function to remodel structured RNAs and/or RNA-protein interactions and play indispensable roles in viral life cycles. Guaico Culex virus (GCXV) is the first uncovered animal-infected multicomponent virus with segmented positive-sense genomic RNAs. GCXV belongs to the Jingmenvirus group, a diverse clade of segmented viruses that are related to the prototypically unsegmented Flavivirus. However, little is known about the exact functions of the GCXV-encoded proteins. Here, we show that the putative non-structural protein (NSP) 2 on segment 2 of GCXV functions as an RNA helicase that unwinds RNA helix bidirectionally in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner, and an RNA chaperone that remodels structured RNAs and facilitates RNA strand annealing independently of ATP. Together, our findings are the first demonstration of RNA-remodelling activity encoded by Jingmenvirus and highlight the functional significance of NSP2 in the GCXV life cycle.",-1
microRNA-4701-5p protects against interleukin-1Î² induced human chondrocyte CHON-001 cells injury via modulating HMGA1,"Background:                    miRNA-4701-5p has been reported to be a vital regulator in many diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, and miRNA-4701-5p is evidenced to be participated in synovial invasion and joint destruction. In our report, we investigated the roles of miRNA-4701-5p in osteoarthritis (OA) and analyzed the molecular mechanism.              Methods:                    Interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) was applied for stimulating human chondrocyte CHON-001 cells to establish an OA injury model. mRNA levels and protein expression were measured using qRT-PCR and western blot assay, respectively. The proliferation ability and cytotoxicity of CHON-001 cells were checked using MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase activity. The inflammation of chondrocytes was accessed by the secretion levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±. The apoptosis of chondrocytes was determined by flow cytometry assay. Bioinformatics software Starbase v2.0 analyzed the functional binding sites between miRNA-4701-5p and HMGA1 and the interaction was further confirmed using dual luciferase reporter analysis.              Results:                    miRNA-4701-5p was down-regulated in the IL-1Î²-stimulated chondrocytes and HMGA1 directly targeted miRNA-4701-5p. Up-regulation of miRNA-4701-5p could alleviate IL-1Î²-treated CHON-001 cells inflammation and apoptosis, and reversed the cell proliferation decrease and cytotoxicity increase after IL-1Î² treatment. Nevertheless, all the roles of miRNA-4701-5p overexpression in CHON-001 cells could be reversed by HMGA1 up-regulation.              Conclusions:                    miRNA-4701-5p could alleviate the inflammatory injury of IL-1Î²-treated CHON-001 cells via down-regulating HMGA1, indicating that miRNA-4701-5p/HMGA1 is a promising therapeutic target for OA.",-1
The feasibility of Chinese massage as an auxiliary way of replacing or reducing drugs in the clinical treatment of adult type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:                    At present, metformin is mainly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). When the therapeutic effect is achieved, there are side effects and secondary failure will occur if taken for a long time. It is of great significance to actively explore the clinical scheme of reducing drug use while ensuring the therapeutic effect of T2DM.              Objective:                    To evaluate the feasibility of Chinese massage (CM) in the treatment of T2DM.              Methods:                    Literature retrieval is divided into 2 aspects: Electronic Retrieval and Personal Check. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Cochrane Central, which were registered in international clinical trials registry platform systems, select all eligible studies published before November 2, 2019, and use Personal Check method to retrieve papers, conference papers, ongoing experiments, internal reports, and so on. With fasting blood glucose, 2-hour fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin index as the main observation indexes, we also pay attention to traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score scale, insulin resisting index, body mass index , serum total cholesterol, Curative effect and the occurrence of all adverse reactions in drug treatment.Of the research group 2 researchers respective selected literature, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias. After that we used Revman 5.7 and Stata 12.1 statistical software for meta-analysis.              Results:                    A total of 769 subjects were included in 10 studies for meta-analysis. Compared with metformin hydrochloride tablets, CM plus baseline treatment can reduce fasting plasma glucose (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.54, -0.13], Z = 3.15, P = .002), 2 hours postprandial blood glucose (WMD = -0.52, 95% CI [-0.70, -0.34), Z = 5.66, P < .00001], hemoglobin A1c (WMD = 0.12, 95% CI [0.04, 0.20], Z = 2.94, P = .003), fasting insulin (WMD = -3.59, 95% CI [-5.56, -1.42], Z = 10.29,P < .00001), traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score scale (WMD = -4.55, 95% CI [-7.58, -1.51], Z = 2.94, P = .003),homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (WMD = -1.76, 95% CI [-2.25, -1.27), Z = 7.08, P < .00001),body mass index (WMD = -1.28, 95% CI [-1.65, -0.92], Z = 6.91, P < .00001), serum total cholesterol (WMD = -1.01, 95% CI [-1.14, -0.83], Z = 15.51, P < .00001), meanwhile, the effective rate was increased (risk ratio [RR] = 1.31, 95% CI [1.21, 1.42], Z = 6.57, P < .00001).              Conclusion:                    CM combined with metformin hydrochloride tablet has a synergistic effect. It can not only be used as an auxiliary treatment of T2DM, but also as an important reference way of reducing drug treatment of T2DM, improving Clinical Efficacy and reducing adverse reactions.

Short-term fasting differentially regulates PI3K/AkT/mTOR and ERK signalling in the rat hypothalamus,"It is known that insulin secreted by pancreatic Î²-cells enters the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier. However, it was demonstrated that insulin expression occurs in various brain regions as well. Albeit the list of insulin actions in the brain is long and it includes control of energy homeostasis, neuronal survival, maintenance of synaptic plasticity and cognition, not much is known about the adaptive significance of insulin synthesis in brain. We previously reported that short-term fasting promotes insulin expression and subsequent activation of insulin receptor in the rat periventricular nucleus. In order to uncover a physiological importance of the fasting-induced insulin expression in hypothalamus, we analyzed the effect of short-term food deprivation on the expression of several participants of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways that are typically activated by this hormone. We found that the hypothalamic content of total and activated IRS1, IRS2, PI3K, and mTOR remained unchanged, but phosphorylated AKT1/2/3 was decreased. The levels of activated ERK1/2 were increased after six-hour fasting. Moreover, activated ERK1/2 was co-expressed with activated insulin receptor in the nucleus arcuatus. Our previously published and current findings suggest that the ERK activation in hypothalamus was at least partially initiated by the centrally produced insulin.",-1
Avid binding by B cells to the Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein repeat suppresses responses to protective subdominant epitopes,"Antibodies targeting the NANP/NVDP repeat domain of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSPRepeat) can protect against malaria. However, it has also been suggested that the CSPRepeat is a decoy that prevents the immune system from mounting responses against other domains of CSP. Here, we show that, following parasite immunization, B cell responses to the CSPRepeat are immunodominant over responses to other CSP domains despite the presence of similar numbers of naive B cells able to bind these regions. We find that this immunodominance is driven by avid binding of the CSPRepeat to cognate B cells that are able to expand at the expense of B cells with other specificities. We further show that mice immunized with repeat-truncated CSP molecules develop responses to subdominant epitopes and are protected against malaria. These data demonstrate that the CSPRepeat functions as a decoy, but truncated CSP molecules may be an approach for malaria vaccination.",-1
Protective effects of chlorogenic acid on trimethyltin chloride-induced neurobehavioral dysfunctions in mice relying on the gut microbiota,"Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is acknowledged to have potent neurotoxicity. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), the most abundant polyphenol in the human diet, is well-known for its neuroprotective activity. This investigation was performed to determine the effects and mechanisms of CGA on TMT-induced neurobehavioral dysfunctions. Mice received oral administrations of CGA (30 mg kg-1) for 11 days, in which they were intraperitoneally injected with TMT (2.7 mg kg-1) once on the 8th day. The daily intake of CGA significantly alleviated TMT-induced epilepsy-like seizure and cognition impairment, ameliorating hippocampal neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation. Oral gavage of CGA potentially exerted neuroprotective effects through JNK/c-Jun and TLR4/NFÎºB pathways. Microbiome analysis revealed that daily consumption of CGA raised the relative abundance of Lactobacillus in TMT-treated mice. SCFAs, the gut microbial metabolites associated with neuroprotection, were increased in the mouse hippocampus following CGA treatment. TMT-induced neurotransmitter disorders were regulated by oral gavage of CGA, especially DL-kynurenine and acetylcholine chloride. Additionally, neurotransmitters in the mouse hippocampus were found to be highly associated with the gut microbiota. Our findings provided research evidence for the neuroprotective effect of CGA on TMT-induced neurobehavioral dysfunctions.",-1
Comprehensive Analysis of lncRNA Expression Profile and the Potential Role of ENST00000604491 in Graves' Disease,"Background:                    Graves' disease (GD) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases worldwide and develops in 20 to 50 cases per 100,000 persons annually. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely expressed in multiple human diseases and have pivotal functions in gene regulation. This study is aimed at determining the lncRNA profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from GD patients and investigating the role of ENST00000604491 in GD.              Methods:                    A total of 31 GD patients and 32 normal controls were enrolled in the study. Next-generation sequencing was performed to identify the dysregulated lncRNAs in the PBMCs from the 5 GD patients and 5 normal controls, and 26 GD patients and 27 controls were used to verify the selected lncRNAs. The relative expression of verified lncRNAs, forkhead box P1 (FOXP1), and IKAROS family zinc finger 3 (IKZF3) from these samples was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. The potential biomarker value was assessed by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.              Results:                    A total of 37,683 dysregulated expressed lncRNAs were indicated, of which 5 lncRNAs were significantly upregulated and 83 lncRNAs were remarkably downregulated in the GD patients compared with healthy subjects. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses showed that abnormally expressed lncRNAs were mainly enriched in immune system-related signalling pathways. Among the selected lncRNAs, the relative expression of ENST00000604491 was significantly downregulated and negatively correlated with the serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAb) in GD patients. Further studies confirmed that decreased FOXP1 expression was inversely correlated with serum TRAb levels in GD patients. Moreover, there was a notably positive correlation between ENST00000604491 expression and FOXP1 transcript levels in GD. The area under the ROC curve of ENST00000604491 was up to 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.87, p < 0.01), and the sensitivity and specificity were 53.85% and 88.89%, respectively.              Conclusion:                    The present study identifies ENST00000604491 as a significantly attenuated lncRNA in GD patients, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of GD by regulating FOXP1 and represent a potential biomarker for GD.",-1
Mistakes Made and Lessons Learned: A Mid-Career Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon's Journey to Sustain Energy and Avoid Burnout,"Introduction:                    Twenty-three years into this journey as a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, my path is littered with mistakes made. The collision of a ""family-first"" philosophy with the demands of my busy academic surgical practice-not pretty. As a canary in a toxic coal mine, I have failed to fix the mine, so I have focused on being the very strongest and resilient canary possible.              Methods:                    This is a retrospective study of mistakes made and lessons learned. The mistakes include submitting to the tyranny of perfectionism; failure to resist the tendency to measure ourselves against others; saying ""yes"" to every request; thinking my job is Monday to Friday, and career is nights/weekends; being given a big new job, but using same old time/energy management strategy; sloppy time management; failure to manage energy; considering sleep ""a waste of time;"" failure to manage attention; dragging the challenges from my day through the door each night; thinking that the skills that make me good at work are same that will make me good at home; aiming for work-life ""balance;"" and sometimes losing sight of our mission.              Results:                    It is too soon to tell whether the lessons I have learned from all my mistakes are essential to preventing burnout. Although I am certain my results to date are significant, I cannot prove statistically significance. I am working to develop Appropriate Use Criteria for time and energy, and Best Practice Guidelines for prioritizing where to focus attention in life.              Discussion:                    We need to manage our energy, time, and priorities with great care, and learn from the experts who are trying to teach corporate executives and professional athletes how to function in a high-pressure environment.              Conclusions:                    Pediatric orthopaedics is one of the most wonderful professional callings. We can and should be happy and resilient canaries. The owners of the coal mine should hear us singing sweet songs about the children we care for even as they make the air increasingly toxic.",-1
The Role of Gut Microbiota in Gastrointestinal Tract Cancers,"Disturbances in gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota could play a significant role in the development of GI cancers, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. While some bacteria seem to facilitate carcinogenesis, others appear to be protective. So far only one bacterium (Helicobacter pylori) has been classified by the International Agency for Cancer Research as carcinogenic in humans but many other are the subject of intense research. Most studies on the role of microbiota in GI tract oncogenesis focus on pancreatic and colorectal cancers with the following three species: Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and Porphyromonas gingivalis as likely causative factors. This review summarizes the role of bacteria in GI tract oncogenesis.",-1
Breeding Sites of Synanthropic Mosquitoes in Zika-Affected Areas of the Dominican Republic,"Mosquito-borne diseases are a major public health concern in the Caribbean. Domestic water-storage containers are preferred breeding habitats for synanthropic mosquito species, among which Aedes aegypti stands out due to its role in arbovirus transmission. To determine the microenvironmental features associated with container-dwelling mosquitoes, a house-to-house cross-sectional entomological survey was carried out in 9 Dominican provinces affected by Zika virus in 2016. All containers with the potential to store water were sampled, all immature mosquitoes were collected, and information on the type, capacity, volume of stored water, building material, presence of flowers, and house location was documented. The specimens were identified and larval indices (House index [HI], Container index [CI], Breteau index [BI], and Ae. aegypti Breeding Percentage) were applied. A total of 665 dwellings were surveyed across 30 neighborhoods. A total of 1,420 water-filled container habitats were sampled, 19.3% of which harbored immature mosquitoes of 5 species, including 4 important vectors. The dominance of Ae. aegypti was marked, as it was present in all sampled neighborhoods, inhabiting 272 containers (19.1%). Larval indices were higher than the threshold values accepted (5% for the HI and BI, and 3% for the CI) in almost all neighborhoods. The presence of Aedes spp. was associated with the serviceability of water-holding containers (Ï2 = 16.56522; P < 0.001), and the difference in volume between water-holding containers was associated with the presence of Aedes spp. infection (Ï2 = 4; P < 0.001), the containers up to 5 liters being the most infested. This is the first entomological research based on synanthropic mosquito breeding habitats that cover urban areas of the 3 macro-regions of the Dominican Republic.",-1
Fecal microbiota transplantation as tool to study the interrelation between microbiota composition and miRNA expression,"The intestinal gut microbiota is important for human metabolism and immunity and can be influenced by many host factors. A recently emerged host factor is secreted microRNA (miRNA). Previously, it has been shown that secreted miRNAs can influence the growth of certain bacteria and conversely, that shifts in the microbiota can alter the composition of secreted miRNAs. Here, we sought to further investigate the interaction between the gut microbiota and secreted miRNAs by the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Subjects with the metabolic syndrome received either an autologous (n = 4) or allogenic (n = 14) FMT. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and 6 weeks after FMT, from which the microbiome and miRNA composition were determined via 16S rRNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing, respectively. We observed a significant correlation between the fecal miRNA expression and microbiota composition, both before and after FMT. Our results suggest that the FMT-induced shift in microbiota altered the fecal miRNA profile, indicated by correlations between differentially abundant microbes and miRNAs. This idea of a shift in miRNA composition driven by changes in the microbiota was further strengthened by the absence of a direct effect of specific miRNAs on the growth of specific bacterial strains.",-1
Antioxidative role of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Parkinson's disease,"Ethnopharmacological relevance:                    Neuroprotective Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been practiced in alternative medicine from early days. TCM-derived neuroprotective compounds, such as Chrysin, Cannabidiol, Toonasinoids, and Î²-asaron, exert significant effectiveness's towards Parkinson's disease (PD). Further, these neuroprotective TCM showed antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-septic, analgesic properties. Recent research showed that the reduction in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) decreased the Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) toxicity and enhanced the dopaminergic neuron regenerations, the main hallmarks of PD. Therefore, the neuroprotective effects of novel TCM due to its antiradical activities needed deep investigations.              Aims of the study:                    This review aims to enlighten the neuroprotective TCM and its components with their antioxidative properties to the scientific community for future research.              Method:                    The relevant information on the neuroprotective TCM was gathered from scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Wiley Online Library, ACS Publications, and CNKI). Information was also gained from MS and Ph.D. thesis, books, and online databases. The literature cited in this review dates from 2001 to June 2, 0201.              Results:                    Novel therapies for PD are accessible, mostly rely on Rivastigmine and Donepezil, offers to slow down the progression of disease at an early stage but embraces lots of disadvantages. Researchers are trying to find a potential drug against PD, which is proficient at preventing or curing the disease progress, but still needed to be further identified. Oxidative insult and mitochondrial dysfunction are thought to be the main culprit of neurodegenerations. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the only causative agent in all interactions, leading to PD, from mitochondrial dysfunctions, Î±-syn aggregative toxicity, and DA neurons degenerations. It is evident from the redox balance, which seems an imperative therapeutic approach against PD and was necessary for the significant neuronal activities.              Conclusion:                    Our study is explaining the newly discovered TCM and their neuroprotective and antioxidative properties. But also bring up the possible treatment approaches against PD for future researchers.",-1
Synergistic alleviation effects of anchovy hydrolysates-catechin on scopolamine-induced mice memory deficits: the exploration of the potential relationship among gut-brain-axis,"Anchovy protein hydrolysates (APH) and catechin (CA) have proved to be effective in memory improvement. However, the enhancing effects of APH-CA conjugates on the memory are little investigated. The underlying mechanism and synergic effects remain unclear. Herein, relationships among memory enhancement, gut microbiota, fecal metabolites, and neurotransmitters of mice regulated by APH-CA were investigated. APH, APH-CA, and CA decreased MDA, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î± in liver, altered levels of GPx, LDH, IL-1Î², and TNF-Î± in serum, re-structured gut microbiota, regulated fecal metabolites, and regulated neurotransmitters in the brain. The alleviation effects of APH-CA were partially better than those of APH and CA. The 16s rRNA results illustrated that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were altered. Notably, memory-related metabolites and neurotransmitters were significantly up-regulated by the administration of samples. Moreover, possible connections are observed among the gut microbiota, fecal metabolites, and brain neurotransmitters. Together, the regulation of the microbiota-metabolites-brain-neurotransmitters axis may be one of the mechanisms for APH-CA against scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits. In addition, the synergic effects of APH and CA were partially confirmed.",-1

"Design, synthesis and structure-activity evaluation of novel 2-pyridone-based inhibitors of Î±-synuclein aggregation with potentially improved BBB permeability","The treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative human disorder, continues to be symptomatic. Development of drugs able to stop or at least slowdown PD progression would benefit several million people worldwide. SynuClean-D is a low molecular weight 2-pyridone-based promising drug candidate that inhibits the aggregation of Î±-synuclein in human cultured cells and prevents degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of PD. Improving SynuClean-D pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, performing structure/activity studies and testing its efficacy in mammalian models of PD requires the use of gr-amounts of the compound. However, not enough compound is on sale, and no synthetic route has been reported until now, which hampers the molecule progress towards clinical trials. To circumvent those problems, we describe here an efficient and economical route that enables the synthesis of SynuClean-D with good yields as well as the synthesis of SynuClean-D derivatives. Structure-activity comparison of the new compounds with SynuClean-D reveals the functional groups of the molecule that can be disposed of without activity loss and those that are crucial to interfere with Î±-synuclein aggregation. Several of the derivatives obtained retain the parent's compound excellent in vitro anti-aggregative activity, without compromising its low toxicity. Computational predictions and preliminary testing indicate that the blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability of SynuClean-D is low. Importantly, several of the newly designed and obtained active derivatives are predicted to display good BBB permeability. The synthetic route developed here will facilitate their synthesis for BBB permeability determination and for efficacy testing in mammalian models of PD.",-1
LncRNA CALML3-AS1 suppresses papillary thyroid cancer progression via sponging miR-20a-5p/RBM38 axis,"Background:                    The incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer (TC) has been steadily rising in the past decades. It is imperative to have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TC development and identify novel therapeutic targets. This study characterized the role of lncRNA CALML3-AS1 (CALML3-AS1) in the development of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).              Method:                    Related mRNAs expression were validated in the tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 52 PTC patients and PTC cell lines by qRT-PCR. Expression of RBM38 was detected by Western blot. We have also conducted CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to detect the effect of CALML3-AS1 on cell proliferation, Transwell assay was utilized to evaluate cell migration and invasion, apoptosis detected by flow cytometry assay, RNA pull-down and luciferase assays were performed to validate gene predictions.              Results:                    The results indicated that the expression of both CALML3A-S1 and RBM38 were significantly downregulated in PTC tissues (p < 0.01), while the expression of miR-20a-5p was increased in PTC (p < 0.01). Functionally, CALML3-AS1 overexpression inhibited PTC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CALML 3-AS1 sponged miR-20a-5p, which in turn leads to the suppression of RBM38 expression and PTC progression.              Conclusions:                    CALML3-AS1 functions as a ceRNA for miR-20a-5p in the regulation of the expression of RBM38 in PTC. Higher level of CALML3-AS1 serves as a good prognostic indicator of survival in PTC patients. Targeting CALML3-AS1/ miR-20a-5p/RBM38 axis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of PTC.",-1
"Multiple Resistance Mechanisms to Pyrethroids Insecticides in Anopheles gambiae sensu lato Population From Mali, West Africa","Background:                    Insecticide-based vector control is responsible for reducing malaria mortality and morbidity. Its success depends on a better knowledge of the vector, its distribution, and resistance status to the insecticides used. In this paper, we assessed Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (A gambiae s.l.) population resistance to pyrethroids in different ecological settings.              Methods:                    The World Health Organization standard bioassay test was used to assess F0A gambiae s.l. susceptibility to pyrethroids. Biochemical Synergist assays were conducted with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), S,S,S-tributyl phosphotritioate, and diethyl maleate. L1014F, L1014S, and N1575Y knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations were investigated using TaqMan genotyping.              Results:                    Anopheles gambiae sensu lato was composed of Anopheles arabienisis, Anopheles coluzzii, and A gambiae in all study sites. Anopheles gambiae sensu lato showed a strong phenotypic resistance to deltamethrin and permethrin in all sites (13% to 41% mortality). In many sites, pre-exposure to synergists partially improved the mortality rate suggesting the presence of detoxifying enzymes. The 3 kdr (L1014F, L1014S, and N1575Y) mutations were found, with a predominance of L1014F, in all species.              Conclusions:                    Multiple resistance mechanisms to pyrethroids were observed in A gambiae s.l. in Mali. The PBO provided a better partial restoration of susceptibility to pyrethroids, suggesting that the efficacy of long-lasting insecticidal nets may be improved with PBO.",-1
Minor hallucinations in isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder indicative of early phenoconversion: A preliminary study,"Objectives:                    Minor hallucinations (MH) are psychotic symptoms that can occur anywhere between prodromal to early Parkinson's disease and after onset of motor problems. MH include visual illusions, presence hallucinations, and passage hallucinations. Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a harbinger of neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the clinical characteristics of isolated RBD with MH and the risk of phenoconversion.              Materials and methods:                    We retrospectively analyzed the data of 36 patients with isolated RBD (four females; median age, 75.0 years). We defined cases reporting at least one minor hallucination as RBD with MH. Demographic data and cognitive function were compared between patients with and without MH, and Cox proportional hazards models estimated the risk of phenoconversion.              Results:                    We included 10 (27.8%) patients with MH and 26 (72.2%) without MH. Patients with MH were older, had less dopamine transporter accumulation, more severe autonomic dysfunction, more depressive symptoms, and lower verbal fluency and symbol coding test scores than patients without MH. After follow-up (median, 2.50 years), 13.9% (5/36) of all patients developed phenoconversion (Parkinson's disease, two patients; dementia with Lewy bodies, three patients). The rate of phenoconversion was significantly higher in patients with MH (40.0% vs. 3.8%, p = .005). The Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration revealed that MH was a significant risk factor for phenoconversion (hazard ratio, 14.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-160.5).              Conclusions:                    Minor hallucinations may be utilized as early clinical markers for prodromal estimation of neurodegenerative diseases.",-1
A Versatile Electrochemical Biosensor for the Detection of Circulating MicroRNA toward Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Diagnosis,"Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can be used as noninvasive biomarkers and are also found circulating in body fluids such as blood. Dysregulated miRNA expression is associated with many diseases, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the miRNA assay is helpful in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. In this work, a versatile electrochemical biosensing system is developed for miRNA detection by DNAzyme-cleavage cycling amplification and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification. With cleavage by Mn2+ targeted DNAzyme, DNA-walker can move along the predesigned DNA tracks and contribute to the transduction and enhancement of signals. For the electrochemical process, the formation of multiple G-quadruplex-incorporated long double-stranded DNA (dsDNA/G-quadruplex) structures is triggered through HCR amplification. The introduction of G-quadruplex allows sensitive measurement of miRNA down to 5.68 fM with good specificity. Furthermore, by profiling miRNA in the NSCLC cohort, this designed strategy shows high efficiency (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.879 using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis) with the sensitivity of 80.0% for NSCLC early diagnosis (stage I). For the discrimination of NSCLC and benign disease, the assay displays an AUC of 0.907, superior to six clinically-acceptable protein tumor markers. Therefore, this platform holds promise in clinical application toward NSCLC diagnosis and prognosis.",-1
Physics-informed attention-based neural network for hyperbolic partial differential equations: application to the Buckley-Leverett problem,"Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have enabled significant improvements in modelling physical processes described by partial differential equations (PDEs) and are in principle capable of modeling a large variety of differential equations. PINNs are based on simple architectures, and learn the behavior of complex physical systems by optimizing the network parameters to minimize the residual of the underlying PDE. Current network architectures share some of the limitations of classical numerical discretization schemes when applied to non-linear differential equations in continuum mechanics. A paradigmatic example is the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws that develop highly localized nonlinear shock waves. Learning solutions of PDEs with dominant hyperbolic character is a challenge for current PINN approaches, which rely, like most grid-based numerical schemes, on adding artificial dissipation. Here, we address the fundamental question of which network architectures are best suited to learn the complex behavior of non-linear PDEs. We focus on network architecture rather than on residual regularization. Our new methodology, called physics-informed attention-based neural networks (PIANNs), is a combination of recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms. The attention mechanism adapts the behavior of the deep neural network to the non-linear features of the solution, and break the current limitations of PINNs. We find that PIANNs effectively capture the shock front in a hyperbolic model problem, and are capable of providing high-quality solutions inside the convex hull of the training set.",-1
Additive and Interactive Genetically Contextual Effects of HbA1c on cg19693031 Methylation in Type 2 Diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has a complex genetic and environmental architecture that underlies its development and clinical presentation. Despite the identification of well over a hundred genetic variants and CpG sites that associate with T2D, a robust biosignature that could be used to prevent or forestall clinical disease has not been developed. Based on the premise that underlying genetic variation influences DNA methylation (DNAm) independently of or in combination with environmental exposures, we assessed the ability of local and distal gene x methylation (GxMeth) interactive effects to improve cg19693031 models for predicting T2D status in an African American cohort. Using genome-wide genetic data from 506 subjects, we identified a total of 1476 GxMeth terms associated with HbA1c values. The GxMeth SNPs map to biological pathways associated with the development and complications of T2D, with genetically contextual differences in methylation observed only in diabetic subjects for two GxMeth SNPs (rs2390998 AG vs. GG, p = 4.63 Ã 10-11, ÎÎ² = 13%, effect size = 0.16 [95% CI = 0.05, 0.32]; rs1074390 AA vs. GG, p = 3.93 Ã 10-4, ÎÎ² = 9%, effect size = 0.38 [95% CI = 0.12, 0.56]. Using a repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation approach, a series of balanced random forest classifiers with random under-sampling were built to evaluate the addition of GxMeth terms to cg19693031 models to discriminate between normoglycemic controls versus T2D subjects. The results were compared to those obtained from models incorporating only the covariates (age, sex and BMI) and the addition of cg19693031. We found a post-pruned classifier incorporating 10 GxMeth SNPs and cg19693031 adjusted for covariates predicted the T2D status, with the AUC, sensitivity, specificity and precision of the positive target class being 0.76, 0.81, 0.70 and 0.63, respectively. Comparatively, the AUC, sensitivity, specificity and precision using the covariates and cg19693031 were only 0.71, 0.74, 0.67 and 0.59, respectively. Collectively, we demonstrate correcting for genetic confounding of cg19693031 improves its ability to detect type 2 diabetes. We conclude that an integrated genetic-epigenetic approach could inform personalized medicine programming for more effective prevention and treatment of T2D.",-1
Dexmedetomidine disrupts esophagus cancer tumorigenesis by modulating circ_0003340/miR-198/HMGA2 axis,"More and more studies have focused on the regulatory role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in various cancers. However, it is not clear how dexmedetomidine (DEX) affects esophagus cancer progression by affecting the expression of circRNAs. This study aimed to investigate the role of DEX in esophagus cancer and its underlying mechanism. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis and transwell assay were performed for cell apoptosis and invasion. The protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, matrix metallopeptidase 9, and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) were assessed by western blot assay. The expression levels of circ_0003340 and microRNA-198 (miR-198) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the interaction between miR-198 and circ_0003340 or HMGA2. Murine xenograft model was established to investigate the role of circ_0003340 and DEX in vivo. DEX exerted antitumor effects in esophagus cancer cells. DEX hindered proliferation and invasion while inducing apoptosis of esophagus cancer cells, which was abolished by circ_0003340 elevation, HMGA2 overexpression, or miR-198 silencing. miR-198 directly interacted with circ_0003340 and HMGA2 in esophagus cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of circ_0003340 could improve the anticancer role of DEX in vivo. DEX constrained cell carcinogenesis by regulating circ_0003340/miR-198/HMGA2 axis in esophagus cancer, providing an effective clinical implication for preventing the development of the esophagus cancer by the DEX.",-1
Enzymatic Activity of HPGD in Treg Cells Suppresses Tconv Cells to Maintain Adipose Tissue Homeostasis and Prevent Metabolic Dysfunction,"Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are important for preventing autoimmunity and maintaining tissue homeostasis, but whether Treg cells can adopt tissue- or immune-context-specific suppressive mechanisms is unclear. Here, we found that the enzyme hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD), which catabolizes prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) into the metabolite 15-keto PGE2, was highly expressed in Treg cells, particularly those in visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³)-induced HPGD expression in VAT Treg cells, and consequential Treg-cell-mediated generation of 15-keto PGE2 suppressed conventional T cell activation and proliferation. Conditional deletion of Hpgd in mouse Treg cells resulted in the accumulation of functionally impaired Treg cells specifically in VAT, causing local inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. Consistent with this mechanism, humans with type 2 diabetes showed decreased HPGD expression in Treg cells. These data indicate that HPGD-mediated suppression is a tissue- and context-dependent suppressive mechanism used by Treg cells to maintain adipose tissue homeostasis.",-1
Preterm vs term delivery in antenatally diagnosed gastroschisis: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective:                    To review the evidence regarding gestational age at birth, length of stay, sepsis incidence, days on mechanical ventilation, and mortality between preterm and term deliveries in pregnancies complicated by gastroschisis.              Data sources:                    We conducted database searches of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov without language restrictions through August 16, 2021. References of all relevant articles were reviewed.              Study eligibility criteria:                    Randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, and observational studies were evaluated comparing length of stay, sepsis, days on mechanical ventilation, and mortality between either elective preterm delivery and expectant management (Group 1) or preterm gestational age and term gestational age (Group 2).              Methods:                    Two researchers independently selected studies and evaluated risk of bias with the Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized controlled trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Mean differences and odds ratios were calculated using a random-effects model for inclusion and methodological quality. The primary outcome was length of stay. Secondary outcomes were incidence of sepsis, mortality, days on mechanical ventilation, and gestational age.              Results:                    Thirty studies with a total of 7409 patients were included in the systematic review, of which 25 were included in the analysis. Group 1 studies found no difference in length of stay or mortality and a trend toward fewer days on mechanical ventilation (mean difference, -0.40; 95% confidence interval, -0.89 to -0.10; P=.12; I2=35%). Subgroup analysis excluding premature delivery demonstrated lower sepsis incidence in elective preterm delivery (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.84; P=.01; I2=0%). Group 2 studies found increased length of stay (mean difference, 15.44; 95% confidence interval, 8.44-21.83; P<.00001; I2=94%), sepsis (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.50; P=.008; I2=51%), days on mechanical ventilation (mean difference, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-2.66; P=.03; I2=66%), and mortality (odds ratio, 2.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-5.55; P=.0007; I2=0%). Gestational age was significantly lower in Group 2 studies than in Group 1 studies.              Conclusion:                    Data continue to be conflicting, but subgroup analysis suggested a possible reduction in sepsis incidence and mean days on mechanical ventilation with elective early term delivery.",-1
Transdermal Administration of Volatile Oil from Citrus aurantium- Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae Alleviates Constipation in Rats by Altering Host Metabolome and Intestinal Microbiota Composition,"Background:                    The Citrus aurantium- (ZhiShi, ZS-) Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae (BaiZhu, BZ) pairs are often found in herbal formulas for constipation. The volatile oils of ZS and BZ (ZBVO) have good pharmacological activity against constipation, but the mechanism for treatment of slow transit constipation (STC) remains unclear.              Method:                    A rat model using diphenoxylate tablets was constructed to investigate if transdermal administration of ZBVO would mediate intestinal microorganisms and fecal metabolites and improve STC symptoms. The regulatory effects of ZBVO at 0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 mL kg-1 d-1 on STC rats were assessed by measuring fecal water content, intestinal propulsion rate, histopathology, expression of gastrointestinal hormones, brain and intestinal peptides, and inflammatory factors. The changes in intestinal flora of STC rats were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Moreover, the untargeted fecal metabolomics analysis was performed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) technology.              Results:                    The results showed that ZBVO had a modulating effect on STC by increasing the fecal water content and intestinal propulsion rate. Transdermal administration of ZBVO decreased serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and increased the levels of gastrin (GAS) and substance P (SP). In addition, ZBVO increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels and decreased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels in colon and hippocampus tissues. The results of intestinal microbiota showed that ZBVO improved the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota and changed the community composition by decreasing Romboutsia and increasing Proteobacteria, Allobaculum, and Ruminococcaceae. And the feces metabolomics found that nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, purine metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), pyruvate metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis were modulated.              Conclusion:                    These findings suggest that ZBVO can alleviate STC symptoms by promoting intestinal peristalsis, increasing fecal water content, regulating gastrointestinal hormone level, reducing the inflammatory response, and regulating brain and intestinal peptides after transdermal administration. And structural changes in the intestinal microbiota are closely related to host metabolism and intestinal microbiota destroyed in STC modeling could be significantly improved by the ZBVO, which provides a reference for the development of aromatic drug macrohealth products.",-1
Association between vegetarian diets and cardiovascular risk factors in non-Hispanic white participants of the Adventist Health Study-2,"The association between dietary patterns and CVD risk factors among non-Hispanic whites has not been fully studied. Data from 650 non-Hispanic white adults who participated in one of two clinical sub-studies (about 2 years after the baseline) of the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) were analysed. Four dietary patters were identified using a validated 204-item semi-quantitative FFQ completed at enrolment into AHS-2: vegans (8Â·3 %), lacto-ovo-vegetarians (44Â·3 %), pesco-vegetarians (10Â·6 %) and non-vegetarians (NV) (37Â·3 %). Dietary pattern-specific prevalence ratios (PR) of CVD risk factors were assessed adjusting for confounders with or without BMI as an additional covariable. The adjusted PR for hypertension, high total cholesterol and high LDL-cholesterol were lower in all three vegetarian groups. Among the lacto-ovo-vegetarians the PR were 0Â·57 (95 % CI 0Â·45, 0Â·73), 0Â·72 (95 % CI 0Â·59, 0Â·88) and 0Â·72 (95 % CI 0Â·58, 0Â·89), respectively, which remained significant after additionally adjusting for BMI. The vegans and the pesco-vegetarians had similar PR for hypertension at 0Â·46 (95 % CI 0Â·25, 0Â·83) and 0Â·62 (95 % CI 0Â·42, 0Â·91), respectively, but estimates were attenuated and marginally significant after adjustment for BMI. Compared with NV, the PR of obesity and abdominal adiposity, as well as other CVD risk factors, were significantly lower among the vegetarian groups. Similar results were found when limiting analyses to participants not being treated for CVD risk factors, with the vegans having the lowest mean BMI and waist circumference. Thus, compared with the diet of NV, vegetarian diets were associated with significantly lower levels of CVD risk factors among the non-Hispanic whites.",-1
Fracture of the Distal Radius by Tuberculous Osteomyelitis: A Case Report and Review of Literature,"We report a 94-year-old patient with a fractured radius that was being managed conservatively. At 2 months, an abscess was observed overlying the fracture site. An MRI scan was done and samples obtained for microbiological and pathological analyses. The patient was diagnosed with tuberculous osteomyelitis. Surgical debridement of the fracture site was performed, and the bone defect was filled with bone cement impregnated with gentamicin and rifampicin. Anti-tuberculosis therapy was administered for 9 months and the patient made an uneventful recovery. Early diagnosis and correct medical treatment depend on sound evidence of tuberculous osteomyelitis. Surgical debridement is essential if abscesses are present in the bone. Level of Evidence: Level V (Therapeutic).",-1
Gut microbiome and health: mechanistic insights,"The gut microbiota is now considered as one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of host health. Virtually all our body sites are colonised by microbes suggesting different types of crosstalk with our organs. Because of the development of molecular tools and techniques (ie, metagenomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, metatranscriptomic), the complex interactions occurring between the host and the different microorganisms are progressively being deciphered. Nowadays, gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs) and several types of cancer. Thus, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid and glucose metabolism are affected.In this review, specific attention is given to provide a critical evaluation of the current understanding in this field. Numerous molecular mechanisms explaining how gut bacteria might be causally linked with the protection or the onset of diseases are discussed. We examine well-established metabolites (ie, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide) and extend this to more recently identified molecular actors (ie, endocannabinoids, bioactive lipids, phenolic-derived compounds, advanced glycation end products and enterosynes) and their specific receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARÎ±) and gamma (PPARÎ³), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and G protein-coupled receptors (ie, GPR41, GPR43, GPR119, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5).Altogether, understanding the complexity and the molecular aspects linking gut microbes to health will help to set the basis for novel therapies that are already being developed.",-1
A Polygenic Risk Score of Lipolysis-Increasing Alleles Determines Visceral Fat Mass and Proinsulin Conversion,"Context:                    Primary dysregulation of adipose tissue lipolysis caused by genetic variation and independent of insulin resistance could explain unhealthy body fat distribution and its metabolic consequences.              Objective:                    To analyze common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 48 lipolysis-, but not insulin-signaling-related genes, to form polygenic risk scores of lipolysis-associated SNPs, and to investigate their effects on body fat distribution, glycemia, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and proinsulin conversion.              Study design, participants, and methods:                    SNP array, anthropometric, and metabolic data were available from up to 2789 participants without diabetes of the TÃ¼bingen Family study of type 2 diabetes characterized by oral glucose tolerance tests. In a subgroup (n = 942), magnetic resonance measurements of body fat stores were available.              Results:                    We identified insulin-sensitivity-independent nominal associations (P < 0.05) of SNPs in 10 genes with plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), in 7 genes with plasma glycerol and in 6 genes with both, plasma FFAs and glycerol. A score formed of the latter SNPs (in ADCY4, CIDEA, GNAS, PDE8B, PRKAA1, PRKAG2) was associated with plasma FFA and glycerol measurements (1.4*10-9 â?P â?1.2*10-5), visceral adipose tissue mass (P = 0.0326), and proinsulin conversion (P â?0.0272). The more lipolysis-increasing alleles a subject had, the lower was the visceral fat mass and the lower the proinsulin conversion.              Conclusions:                    We found evidence for a genetic basis of adipose tissue lipolysis resulting from common SNPs in CIDEA, AMP-activated protein kinase subunits, and cAMP signaling components. A genetic score of lipolysis-increasing alleles determined lower visceral fat mass and lower proinsulin conversion.",-1
"Changes in miR-124-1, miR-212, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-155 Expression Patterns after 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene Treatment in CBA/Ca Mice","Specific gene and miRNA expression patterns are potential early biomarkers of harmful environmental carcinogen exposures. The aim of our research was to develop an assay panel by using several miRNAs for the rapid screening of potential carcinogens. The expression changes of miR-124-1, miR-212, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-155 were examined in the spleen, liver, and kidneys of CBA/Ca mice, following the 20 mg/bwkg intraperitoneal 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) treatment. After 24 h RNA was isolated, the miRNA expressions were analyzed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction and compared to a non-treated control. DMBA induced significant changes in the expression of miR-134, miR-132, and miR-124-1 in all examined organs in female mice. Thus, miR-134, miR-132, and miR-124-1 were found to be suitable biomarkers for the rapid screening of potential chemical carcinogens and presumably to monitor the protective effects of chemopreventive agents.",-1
Butyl-fructooligosaccharides modulate gut microbiota in healthy mice and ameliorate ulcerative colitis in a DSS-induced model,"Butyl-fructooligosaccharides (B-FOSs) are newly synthesized prebiotics composed of short-chain FOS (GF2, 1-kestose; GF3, nystose; GF4, fructofuranosyl-nystose; GF5, 1-F-(1-b-D-fructofuranosyl)-2-nystose) bound with one or two butyric groups by ester bonds. Previous in vitro studies have shown that B-FOS treatment increases butyrate production and protects the growth of butyrate-producing bacteria during fermentation. The aim of this study was to further test B-FOS as a novel prebiotic compound by evaluating the effect of B-FOS on gut microbiota via 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis in an Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse model and examining its anti-inflammatory efficacy in a mouse model of colitis induced by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). In the healthy ICR mouse study, linear discriminant analysis effect size results revealed that Bifidobacterium was the representative phylotype in the B-FOS treatment compared to the control group. Furthermore, the cecal butyrate concentration of the B-FOS group was significantly higher than that of the control (P < 0.05). The high concentration of butyrate in the B-FOS treatment was probably associated with the high relative abundance of clusters of orthologous group (COG) 4770 (acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase). In the DSS-induced infection study, B-FOS significantly ameliorated the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis, increased the mRNA expression of occludin, decreased tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) and interleukin (IL-8) in the colon tissues, and significantly increased cecal butyrate concentrations. These findings suggest that B-FOS ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by maintaining the epithelial barrier and reducing the secretion of inflammation related cytokines.",-1
Inhibition of COX-2 ameliorates murine liver schistosomiasis japonica through splenic cellular immunoregulation,"Background:                    We have reported the positive association of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) axis with liver fibrosis induced by Schistosoma japonicum (Sj) infection, and TLR4 signaling controlled this axis. However, how COX-2 regulates immune response during Sj infection is still unclear.              Methods:                    Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate the effect of the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS398 on liver granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Flow cytometry was used to explore the frequency and amount of different immune cell infiltration in the spleen during Sj infection.              Results:                    NS398 significantly reduced the size of liver granuloma, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and alleviated chronic granulomatous inflammation. Mechanically, this might be by decreasing the number of Sj-induced macrophages and T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, T follicular helper (Tfh), T follicular regulatory (Tfr), and germinal center B (GC B) cells. There were no differences in the number of neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, Th17 cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), or total B cells in the spleen of the mice with or without NS398 treatment.              Conclusions:                    COX-2/PGE2 inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic approach for schistosomiasis japonica through splenic cellular immunoregulation.",-1
Comparative efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese patent medicine for cognitive dysfunction in diabetic cognitive dysfunction: A protocol for systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis,"Background:                    More and more studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is one of the main complications of diabetes. The disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism seriously damages brain function and accelerates the conversion to dementia. At present, there are no drugs that can directly treat diabetic cognitive dysfunction. All drugs for the treatment of this disease achieve the purpose of treatment through strict control of blood sugar levels. This method has great limitations. Traditional Chinese patent medicines (TCPMs) work through multiple targets and multiple pathways, which can not only effectively correct the state of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, but also significantly improve cognitive ability, but there is a lack of systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and safety. We use the method of network meta-analysis to systematically and comprehensively compare the effectiveness and safety of different Chinese patent medicines.              Methods:                    We will comprehensively search the following databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wanfang database and China BioMedical Literature. We will include all randomized controlled trials that meet the inclusion criteria, starting from the establishment of the database until September 2021. Two researchers will independently screen the literature based on inclusion criteria. While extracting data, we also assess the risk of bias in the included studies. All the data and evidence obtained will be evaluated by the method of Bayesian network meta-analysis.              Results:                    This study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of various TCPMs for diabetic cognitive dysfunction.              Conclusion:                    The results of this study will provide valuable references for the clinical application of TCPMs, and assist clinicians in formulating more reasonable diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Bibliometric Study of Trends in the Diabetic Nephropathy Research Space from 2016 to 2020,"Background:                    Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), but no bibliometric studies pertaining to DN have been published within the last 5 years.              Objectives:                    Most prior studies have focused on specific problems in the DN field. This study attempts to sort out and visualize the knowledge framework in this research space from a holistic and highly generalized perspective. Readers can quickly understand and master the knowledge regarding DN research conducted from 2016 to 2020, in addition to predicting future research hotspots and possible directions for development in this field in a comprehensive and scientifically valid manner.              Methods:                    Literature information, discourse matrices, and co-occurrence matrices were generated using BICOMB. gCLUTO was used for biclustering analyses and visualization. Strategic diagrams were generated using GraphPad Prism 5. The social network analysis (SNA) was analyzed and plotted using Ucinet 6.0 and Netdraw.              Results:                    In total, 55 high-frequency MeSH terms/MeSH subheadings were selected and grouped into 5 clusters in a biclustering analysis. These analyses revealed that extensive studies of the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of DN have been conducted over the last 5 years, while further research regarding DN-related single nucleotide polymorphisms, miRNAs, and signal transduction are warranted as these research areas remain relatively immature.              Conclusion:                    Together, these results outline a robust knowledge structure pertaining to the field of DN-related research over the last 5 years, providing a valuable resource for readers by enabling the easy comprehension of relevant information. In addition, this analysis highlights predicted DN-related research directions and hotspots.",-1
Duodenojejunal Bypass Plus Sleeve Gastrectomy Reduces Infiltration of Macrophages and Secretion of TNF-Î± in the Visceral White Adipose Tissue of Goto-Kakizaki Rats,"Background:                    Current studies indicate that inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) is a pathogenic characteristic of insulin resistance. However, the significance of visceral WAT inflammation after bariatric surgery remains unclear.              Methods:                    Duodenojejunal bypass plus sleeve gastrectomy (DJB-SG) was performed on Goto-Kakisaki rats. Weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in the DJB-SG group were compared to those in a sham surgery (SHAM) group every 2 weeks. The results of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the volume of visceral adipose tissue (Visc.Fat) were compared before and 8 weeks postsurgery. Eight weeks after surgery, the rats were sacrificed and visceral WAT collected from the greater omentum. Tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68) expression in the WAT were evaluated in paraffin-embedded sections by immunohistochemistry.              Results:                    Compared with the SHAM group, the DJB-SG group demonstrated a significant reduction in weight, FBG, and HOMA-IR (P < 0.05), with elevation of insulin levels (P < 0.05) from 4 weeks after surgery. OGTT and the quantity of Visc.Fat were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) 8 weeks after surgery. Moreover, the expression of TNF-Î± and CD68 in the visceral white adipose tissue was significantly lower 8 weeks after surgery (P < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    The DJB-SG model established in Goto-Kakisaki rats achieved anticipated efficacy. Reduced TNF-Î±-related inflammation in visceral WAT may result in improved insulin resistance.",-1
The repertoire of testicular extracellular vesicle cargoes and their involvement in inter-compartmental communication associated with spermatogenesis,"Background:                    Spermatogenesis is regulated by a complex network of intercellular communication processes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are one of the important mediators in intercellular communication. Previous reports have demonstrated the involvement of EVs from the epididymis and prostate in sperm maturation and function. However, the presence of EVs in the testis and their potential involvement in spermatogenesis has not been explored. Here, we have established a testis dissociation protocol that allows the isolation and characterization of testicular EVs.              Results:                    We show that testicular EVs are specifically and efficiently taken up by somatic cells and germ cells, including the spermatozoa in the interstitial space and the seminiferous tubule compartments. We profiled the proteome of testicular EVs and probed the cell types that release them, revealing the potential contributions from the Leydig cells and testicular macrophages. Moreover, we sequenced the small RNA cargoes of testicular EVs and identified sets of small non-coding RNAs that were overlooked in the testis transcriptome. Selected miRNA candidates in testicular EVs were found in sperm RNA payload and demonstrated specific resistance towards ribonuclease A independent of the vesicle membrane. Small molecule inhibition of EV secretion perturbed spermatogenesis via inter-compartmental communication.              Conclusions:                    Together, our study provides a valuable resource on the repertoire of cargoes carried by testicular EVs and uncovers a physiological function of testicular EVs in inter-compartmental communication associated to spermatogenesis.",-1
Seizure modulation by the gut microbiota and tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in an animal model of infantile spasms,"Background:                    The infantile spasms syndrome is an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy presenting in the first 2 years of life, often with severe developmental consequences. The role of the gut microbiota and metabolism in infantile spasms remains unexplored.              Methods:                    Employing a brain injury neonatal rat model of infantile spasms intractable to anticonvulsant medication treatments, we determined how the ketogenic diet and antibiotics affected specific microbial communities and the resultant circulating factors that confer spasms protection in the infantile spasms model. To confirm a role of kynurenine metabolism pathway in spasms protection, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 was pharmacologically inhibited and comprehensive metabolomics was applied.              Findings:                    We show that antibiotics reduced spasms and improved the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet when given in combination. Examination of the gut microbiota and metabolomics showed the downregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 and upregulation of hippocampal kynurenic acid, a metabolite with antiepileptic effects. To further test the involvement of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, a specific antagonist 1-methyltryptophan and minocycline, an antibiotic and inhibitor of kynurenine formation from tryptophan, were administered, respectively. Both treatments were effective in reducing spasms and elevating hippocampal kynurenic acid. A fecal microbiota transplant experiment was then performed to examine the contribution of the gut microbiota on spasm mitigation. Transplant of feces of ketogenic diet animals into normal diet animals was effective in reducing spasms.              Interpretation:                    These results highlight the importance of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in infantile spasms and provide evidence for new-targeted therapies such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 inhibition or microbiota manipulation to promote kynurenic acid production as a strategy to reduce spasms in infantile spasms.              Funding:                    This study was funded by the Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute and the Owerko Centre.",-1
"Effects of Epeleuton, a Novel Synthetic Second-Generation n-3 Fatty Acid, on Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Triglycerides, Glycemic Control, and Cardiometabolic and Inflammatory Markers","Background Epeleuton is 15-hydroxy eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, a second-generation synthetic n-3 fatty acid derivative of eicosapentaenoic acid. The primary objective was to assess the effect of epeleuton on markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with post hoc analyses of cardiometabolic markers. Methods and Results In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 96 adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and body mass index 25 to 40 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive epeleuton 2 g/day, epeleuton 1 g/day, or placebo for 16 weeks. A total of 27% of patients had diabetes mellitus. Primary end points of changes in alanine aminotransferase and liver stiffness did not improve at week 16. Secondary and post hoc analyses investigated changes in cardiometabolic markers. Epeleuton 2 g/day significantly decreased triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol without increasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Despite a low mean baseline hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C; 6.3Â±1.3%), epeleuton 2 g/day significantly decreased HbA1c (-0.4%; P=0.026). Among patients with baseline HbA1c >6.5%, epeleuton 2 g/day decreased HbA1c by 1.1% (P=0.047; n=26). Consistent dose-dependent reductions were observed for fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance indices. Epeleuton 2 g/day decreased circulating markers of cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction. Epeleuton was well tolerated, with a safety profile not different from placebo. Conclusions While epeleuton did not meet its primary end points on alanine aminotransferase or liver stiffness, it significantly decreased triglycerides, HbA1C, plasma glucose, and inflammatory markers. These data suggest epeleuton may have potential for cardiovascular risk reduction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by simultaneously targeting hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and systemic inflammation. Further trials are planned. Registration URL: https://www.cliniâcaltrâials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02941549.",-1
Circ_SAR1A regulates the malignant behavior of lung cancer cells via the miR-21-5p/TXNIP axis,"Background:                    Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies globally and a significant component of cancer-related deaths. The lack of early diagnosis accounts for detecting approximately 75% of cancer patients at an intermediate to an advanced stage, with a low 5-year survival rate. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer development is necessary to find reliable and effective therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers.              Methods:                    circ_SAR1A, miR-21-5p, and TXNIP in lung cancer tissues, animal xenografts, and cell lines were validated by qRT-PCR and western blotting analyses. RNase R digestion and nuclear/cytoplasm fractionation experiments were utilized to determine the stability and localization of circ_SAR1A in lung cancer cells. The binding between miR-21-5p and circ_SAR1A or TXNIP was confirmed by luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, Spearman's correlation, and rescue assays. CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, Transwell, and western blotting were utilized to illustrate the malignant behavior of lung cancer cells.              Results:                    circ_SAR1A and TXNIP were down-regulated while miR-21-5p was up-regulated in lung cancer samples and cells. circ_SAR1A was located predominantly in the cytoplasm; it inhibited lung cancer growth in vitro and in vivo by sponging to miR-21-5p. miR-21-5p silencing suppressed lung cancer malignancy by targeting TXNIP.              Conclusions:                    circ_SAR1A is a critical negative regulator of lung carcinogenesis. circ_SAR1A/miR-21-5p/TXNIP attenuation inhibited lung cancer progression, presenting an ideal diagnostic and a potential therapeutic target.",-1
Determining vector competence of Aedes aegypti from Ghana in transmitting dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2,"Background:                    Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, but is not endemic in all areas where this vector is found. For example, the relatively sparse distribution of cases in West Africa is generally attributed to the refractory nature of West African Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) to DENV infection, and particularly the forest-dwelling Ae. aegypti formosus. However, recent studies have shown these mosquitoes to be competent vectors within some West African countries that have suffered outbreaks in the past, such as Senegal. There is however little information on the vector competence of the Ae. aegypti in West African countries such as Ghana with no reported outbreaks.              Methods:                    This study examined the vector competence of 4 Ae. aegypti colonies from urban, semi-urban, and two rural locations in Ghana in transmitting DENV serotypes 1 and 2, using a single colony from Vietnam as control. Midgut infection and virus dissemination were determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), while the presence and concentration of DENV in the saliva of infectious mosquitoes was determined by the focus forming assay.              Results:                    There were significant differences in the colonies' susceptibility to virus infection, dissemination, and transmission. All examined Ghanaian mosquitoes were refractory to infection by DENV serotype 2, while some colonies exhibited potential to transmit DENV serotype 1. None of the tested colonies were as competent as the control group colony.              Conclusions:                    These findings give insight into the possible risk of outbreaks, particularly in the urban areas in the south of Ghana, and highlight the need for continuous surveillance to determine the transmission status and outbreak risk. This study also highlights the need to prevent importation of different DENV strains and potential invasion of new highly vector-competent Ae. aegypti strains, particularly around the ports of entry.",-1
The increase of Î±-synuclein and alterations of dynein in A53T transgenic and aging mouse,"The dynein protein plays a key role in the degradation pathway by attaching to targeted molecules and transporting the autophagosome to the centrosome. Aging plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its effect on dynein is not clear. In this study we analyzed behavioral characteristics using the rod endurance test and climbing rod time test in different aged mice (3 months, 12 months, 20 months), and measured protein expression of dynein, Î±-synuclein, Tctex-1, and LC3 in the substantianigra of the mice by Western blot. The mRNA levels of dynein, Î±-synuclein, LC3 and Tctex-1 were measured by quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR, and detecting expression of dynein and Î±-synuclein by immunofluorescence. We found the motor functions of A53T mutant mice, in 12 months and 20 months, decreased more significantly compared with normal mice (p < 0.05). In addition, the expression of dynein, LC3-â?and Tctex-1 proteins in the substantia nigra of the two groups decreased with age. However, Î±-synuclein protein increased gradually with age, with significantly higher levels in the PD groups compared with age matched controls (p < 0.05). These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence. Our data demonstrates that dynein and other autophagy proteins change with age, and this is associated with increased Î±-synuclein. Therefore, therapeutics that prevent dynein dysfunction may offer novel treatments for PD and other autophagy related diseases.",-1
Accumulation of microbial DNAs promotes to islet inflammation and Î² cell abnormalities in obesity in mice,"Various microbial products leaked from gut lumen exacerbate tissue inflammation and metabolic disorders in obesity. Vsig4+ macrophages are key players preventing infiltration of bacteria and their products into host tissues. However, roles of islet Vsig4+ macrophages in the communication between microbiota and Î² cells in pathogenesis of obesity-associated islet abnormalities are unknown. Here, we find that bacterial DNAs are enriched in Î² cells of individuals with obesity. Intestinal microbial DNA-containing extracellular vesicles (mEVs) readily pass through obese gut barrier and deliver microbial DNAs into Î² cells, resulting in elevated inflammation and impaired insulin secretion by triggering cGAS/STING activation. Vsig4+ macrophages prevent mEV infiltration into Î² cells through a C3-dependent opsonization, whereas loss of Vsig4 leads to microbial DNA enrichment in Î² cells after mEV treatment. Removal of microbial DNAs blunts mEV effects. Loss of Vsig4+ macrophages leads to microbial DNA accumulation in Î² cells and subsequently obesity-associated islet abnormalities.",-1
MLRDFM: a multi-view Laplacian regularized DeepFM model for predicting miRNA-disease associations,"Motivation:                    MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as critical regulators, are involved in various fundamental and vital biological processes, and their abnormalities are closely related to human diseases. Predicting disease-related miRNAs is beneficial to uncovering new biomarkers for the prevention, detection, prognosis, diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases.              Results:                    In this study, we propose a multi-view Laplacian regularized deep factorization machine (DeepFM) model, MLRDFM, to predict novel miRNA-disease associations while improving the standard DeepFM. Specifically, MLRDFM improves DeepFM from two aspects: first, MLRDFM takes the relationships among items into consideration by regularizing their embedding features via their similarity-based Laplacians. In this study, miRNA Laplacian regularization integrates four types of miRNA similarity, while disease Laplacian regularization integrates two types of disease similarity. Second, to judiciously train our model, Laplacian eigenmaps are utilized to initialize the weights in the dense embedding layer. The experimental results on the latest HMDD v3.2 dataset show that MLRDFM improves the performance and reduces the overfitting phenomenon of DeepFM. Besides, MLRDFM is greatly superior to the state-of-the-art models in miRNA-disease association prediction in terms of different evaluation metrics with the 5-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, case studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of MLRDFM.",-1
Advancing human health in the decade ahead: pregnancy as a key window for discovery: A Burroughs Wellcome Fund Pregnancy Think Tank,"Recent revolutionary advances at the intersection of medicine, omics, data sciences, computing, epidemiology, and related technologies inspire us to ponder their impact on health. Their potential impact is particularly germane to the biology of pregnancy and perinatal medicine, where limited improvement in health outcomes for women and children has remained a global challenge. We assembled a group of experts to establish a Pregnancy Think Tank to discuss a broad spectrum of major gestational disorders and adverse pregnancy outcomes that affect maternal-infant lifelong health and should serve as targets for leveraging the many recent advances. This report reflects avenues for future effects that hold great potential in 3 major areas: developmental genomics, including the application of methodologies designed to bridge genotypes, physiology, and diseases, addressing vexing questions in early human development; gestational physiology, from immune tolerance to growth and the timing of parturition; and personalized and population medicine, focusing on amalgamating health record data and deep phenotypes to create broad knowledge that can be integrated into healthcare systems and drive discovery to address pregnancy-related disease and promote general health. We propose a series of questions reflecting development, systems biology, diseases, clinical approaches and tools, and population health, and a call for scientific action. Clearly, transdisciplinary science must advance and accelerate to address adverse pregnancy outcomes. Disciplines not traditionally involved in the reproductive sciences, such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, and pharmacology, should be engaged at the study design phase to optimize the information gathered and to identify and further evaluate potentially actionable therapeutic targets. Information sources should include noninvasive personalized sensors and monitors, alongside instructive ""liquid biopsies"" for noninvasive pregnancy assessment. Future research should also address the diversity of human cohorts in terms of geography, racial and ethnic distributions, and social and health disparities. Modern technologies, for both data-gathering and data-analyzing, make this possible at a scale that was previously unachievable. Finally, the psychosocial and economic environment in which pregnancy takes place must be considered to promote the health and wellness of communities worldwide.",-1
Novel biomarkers identified in triple-negative breast cancer through RNA-sequencing,"Background and aims:                    Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis due to its aggressive biological behavior and lack of therapeutic targets. Here, we aimed to identify specific biomarkers for TNBC by using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.              Materials and methods:                    Fresh breast tumor tissues were obtained from 34 patients who were admitted to the Breast Center, Peking University People's Hospital, from June 2020 to December 2020; the patients were pathologically diagnosed with primary breast cancer and underwent surgery for the resection of tumor tissues. Tumor-tissue RNA was extracted and the generated cDNA libraries were sequenced using the NextSeq platform, after which the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TNBC and other subtypes of breast cancer were identified and DEG functional-enrichment analysis was performed. Next, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the most significant module and hub genes in TNBC, and then the correlations between the hub genes and the prognosis of TNBC patients were analyzed through survival analysis. Lastly, qRT-PCR analysis was used to validate the expression levels of hub genes in tumor tissues from TNBC and other subtypes of breast cancer.              Results:                    Comparison of TNBC tissues and tissues from other subtypes of breast cancer led to the identification of 273 DEGs in TNBC: 172 upregulated and 101 downregulated genes. In Gene Ontology analysis of the DEGs, five terms were significantly enriched, ""developmental process,"" ""anatomical structure development,"" ""tissue development,"" ""cell cycle,"" and ""epithelium development,"" and in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, the most significantly enriched pathways for all DEGs were ""cell cycle,"" ""mitophagy-animal,"" and ""autophagy-animal."" Furthermore, we identified the core module related to TNBC and screened for hub genes by using WGCNA, and after verifying the top 100 genes based on survival analysis, we selected four genes as the hub genes: SERPINB4, SMR3A, FERMT1, and STARD4; elevated expression of these genes was associated with poor overall survival (OS) of TNBC patients. Notably, qRT-PCR results indicated that FERMT1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in TNBC samples.              Conclusion:                    The DEG profiles between tissues from TNBC and other subtypes of breast cancer were identified using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. FERMT1 was significantly upregulated in TNBC tumor tissues, and increased expression of FERMT1 was associated with poor OS of TNBC patients. FERMT1 could serve as a specific biomarker of and therapeutic target in TNBC.",-1
Metformin-induced reductions in tumor growth involves modulation of the gut microbiome,"Background/purpose:                    Type 2 diabetes and obesity increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Metformin may reduce colorectal cancer but the mechanisms mediating this effect remain unclear. In mice and humans, a high-fat diet (HFD), obesity and metformin are known to alter the gut microbiome but whether this is important for influencing tumor growth is not known.              Methods:                    Mice with syngeneic MC38 colon adenocarcinomas were treated with metformin or feces obtained from control or metformin treated mice.              Results:                    We find that compared to chow-fed controls, tumor growth is increased when mice are fed a HFD and that this acceleration of tumor growth can be partially recapitulated through transfer of the fecal microbiome or in vitro treatment of cells with fecal filtrates from HFD-fed animals. Treatment of HFD-fed mice with orally ingested, but not intraperitoneally injected, metformin suppresses tumor growth and increases the expression of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing microbes Alistipes, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. The transfer of the gut microbiome from mice treated orally with metformin to drug naÃ¯ve, conventionalized HFD-fed mice increases circulating propionate and butyrate, reduces tumor proliferation, and suppresses the expression of sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) gene targets in the tumor.              Conclusion:                    These data indicate that in obese mice fed a HFD, metformin reduces tumor burden through changes in the gut microbiome.",-1
Adoption of Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Gastrointestinal Filling Contrast on Artificial Intelligence Algorithm in Clinical Diagnosis of Gastric Cancer,"This research was aimed to explore the value of gastrointestinal filling contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and computed tomography (CT-)-enhanced scanning based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm in the evaluation of gastric cancer staging. 102 patients with gastric cancer were selected as the research objects. All of them underwent CEUS of gastrointestinal filling and 64-slice spiral CT before surgery. In addition, an improved mean shift algorithm was proposed based on differential optical flow and deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN), which was applied in image processing. The predicted positive rate (PPR), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of gastric cancer in different stages by CEUS and CT were calculated using pathological diagnosis results as the gold standard. 17 patients with T1 stage, 41 patients with T2-T3 stage, and 35 patients with T4 stage were detected by CEUS. 13 patients with T1 stage, 34 patients with T2-T3 stage, and 30 patients with T4 stage were detected by CT enhanced examination. The PPRs of CEUS for T1, T2-T3, and T4 stages of gastric cancer were higher than those of CT enhanced (P < 0.05). The PPR of CEUS for N0 staging of gastric cancer was higher than that of CT enhanced (P < 0.05), and it for N3 staging of gastric cancer was lower than that of CT enhanced (P < 0.05). From the analysis of M staging of gastric cancer, the PPRs of CEUS for M0 and M1 staging of gastric cancer were not statistically different from the PPRs of CT enhanced (P > 0.05). The sensitivity (95.6%), specificity (81.82%), and accuracy (94.12%) of CEUS in assessing resectability were significantly higher than those of CT enhancement (89.01%, 63.67%, and 86.27%, respectively), and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). In summary, CEUS gastrointestinal filling based on the D-CNN algorithm could better improve the display rate of the tissue lesions around the stomach. It also helped to judge the lesion progress, the depth of infiltration, and lymph node metastasis of the lesion. In addition, it had excellent performance in evaluating the resectability of gastric cancer before surgery and had clinical promotion value.",-1
Field Analysis of Biological Factors Associated With Sites at High and Low to Moderate Risk for Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Winter Activity in Florida,"Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is the most pathogenic arbovirus endemic to the United States. Studies have demonstrated Florida's role as a regional reservoir for the virus and its ability to support year-round transmission. Previous research has developed risk index models for mapping locations most at risk for EEEV transmission. We compared vector abundance, vector feeding behavior, potential host species, and fauna presence at high versus low-moderate risk sites during the winter and spring. Predicted high-risk sites had a significantly greater abundance of mosquitoes overall, including Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) (Diptera: Culicidae), the primary enzootic vector of EEEV. Twenty host species were identified from Cs. melanura bloodmeals, with the majority taken from avian species. Culiseta melanura largely fed upon the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis (Passeriformes: Cardinalidae)), which accounted for 20-24.4% of the bloodmeals obtained from this species in years 1 and 2, respectively. One EEEV-positive mosquito pool (Cs. melanura) and nine EEEV seropositive sentinel chickens were confirmed during winter-spring collections from high-risk sites; no seropositive chickens nor mosquito pools were found at the low-moderate risk sites. These results suggest that high-risk sites for EEEV activity are characterized by habitats that support populations of Cs. melanura and which may also provide ample opportunities to feed upon Northern Cardinals. The overall low level of mosquito populations during the winter also suggests that control of Cs. melanura populations in winter at high-risk sites may prove effective in reducing EEEV transmission during the peak summer season.",-1
Fully connected autoencoder and convolutional neural network with attention-based method for inferring disease-related lncRNAs,"Since abnormal expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is often closely related to various human diseases, identification of disease-associated lncRNAs is helpful for exploring the complex pathogenesis. Most of recent methods concentrate on exploiting multiple kinds of data related to lncRNAs and diseases for predicting candidate disease-related lncRNAs. These methods, however, failed to deeply integrate the topology information from the meta-paths that are composed of lncRNA, disease and microRNA (miRNA) nodes. We proposed a new method based on fully connected autoencoders and convolutional neural networks, called ACLDA, for inferring potential disease-related lncRNA candidates. A heterogeneous graph that consists of lncRNA, disease and miRNA nodes were firstly constructed to integrate similarities, associations and interactions among them. Fully connected autoencoder-based module was established to extract the low-dimensional features of lncRNA, disease and miRNA nodes in the heterogeneous graph. We designed the attention mechanisms at the node feature level and at the meta-path level to learn more informative features and meta-paths. A module based on convolutional neural networks was constructed to encode the local topologies of lncRNA and disease nodes from multiple meta-path perspectives. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrated ACLDA achieves superior performance than several state-of-the-art prediction methods. Case studies on breast, lung and colon cancers demonstrated that ACLDA is able to discover the potential disease-related lncRNAs.",-1
Adipose Insulin Resistance in Normal-Weight Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Context:                    Normal-weight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may have adipose tissue insulin resistance (adipose-IR).              Objective:                    To examine whether adipose-IR and subcutaneous (SC) abdominal adipose stem cell (ASC) gene expression are altered in normal-weight women with PCOS and correlated with hyperandrogenemia and/or whole-body IR.              Design:                    Prospective cohort study.              Setting:                    Academic medical center.              Patients:                    Ten normal-weight women with PCOS and 18 control subjects matched for age and body mass index.              Intervention(s):                    Women underwent circulating hormone and metabolic measurements, IV glucose tolerance testing, total-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and SC abdominal fat biopsy.              Main outcome measure(s):                    Adipose-IR (fasting insulin Ã total fatty acid levels) and SC abdominal ASC gene expression were compared between groups and correlated with clinical outcomes.              Results:                    Adipose-IR was greater in women with PCOS than in control subjects (P < 0.01), with 29 pmol/L Ã mmol/L providing 94% specificity and 80% sensitivity in discriminating the two groups (P < 0.001). Adipose-IR positively correlated with serum androgen and log of fasting triglyceride (TG) levels, percentage of small adipocytes (P < 0.01, all correlations), and acute insulin response to glucose (P < 0.05); and negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity (Si; P < 0.025) and serum adiponectin levels (P < 0.05). Adjusting for serum androgens, adipose-IR correlations with Si and log TG levels remained significant. ASC genes were differentially expressed by the two groups. Expression of functionally critical genes was associated with serum testosterone and/or fasting insulin levels.              Conclusion:                    Normal-weight women with PCOS have increased adipose-IR and altered ASC gene expression related to hyperandrogenism and IR.",-1
"Exploration of potential mechanism of interleukin-33 up-regulation caused by 1,4-naphthoquinone black carbon in RAW264.7 cells","Background:                    As air pollution has been paid more attention to by public in recent years, effects and mechanism in particulate matter-triggered health problems become a focus of research. Lysosomes and mitochondria play an important role in regulation of inflammation. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) has been proved to promote inflammation in our previous studies. In this research, macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was used to explore the potential mechanism of upregulation of IL-33 induced by 1,4-naphthoquinone black carbon (1,4-NQ-BC), and to explore changes of lysosomes and mitochondria during the process.              Results:                    50 Î¼g/mL 1,4-NQ-BC exposure for 24 h dramatically increased expression of IL-33 in RAW264.7 cells. Lysosomal membrane permeability was damaged by 1,4-NQ-BC treatment, and higher mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS level were induced by 1,4-NQ-BC. The results of proteomics suggested that expression of ferritin light chain was increased after cells were challenged with 1,4-NQ-BC, and it was verified by Western blot. Meanwhile, expressions of p62 and LC3B-II were increased by 50 Î¼g/mL 1,4-NQ-BC in RAW264.7 cells. Ultimately, expression of IL-33 could return to same level as control in cells treated with 50 Î¼g/mL 1,4-NQ-BC and 50 Î¼M deferoxamine combined.              Conclusions:                    1,4-NQ-BC induces IL-33 upregulation in RAW264.7 cells, and it is responsible for higher lysosomal membrane permeability and ROS level, lower mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibition of autophagy. Ferritin light chain possibly plays an important role in the upregulation of IL-33 evoked by 1,4-NQ-BC.",-1
Pathology-associated change in levels and localization of SIDT2 in postmortem brains of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies patients,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are major neurodegenerative disorders that share commonalities in their pathology involving the formation of Lewy bodies, the main component of which is Î±-synuclein protein. Aberrancy and dysfunction in lysosomes have been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. We recently identified a novel lysosomal degradation pathway in which various macromolecules, including Î±-synuclein protein, are directly imported into lysosomes and degraded. In this study, we analyzed the levels and localization of the lysosomal membrane protein SIDT2, a key factor in this pathway, in the postmortem brains of patients with PD and DLB. The levels of SIDT2 protein were significantly higher in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of both PD and DLB cases than in age-matched control subjects, but this difference was not observed in the inferior frontal gyrus. The levels of SIDT2 also showed a strong correlation with Î±-synuclein levels in the ACC of all subjects, including controls. SIDT2 was colocalized with aggregates positive for phosphorylated Î±-synuclein protein, which is a hallmark of Lewy bodies, in all examined cases of both PD and DLB. These observations suggest that changes in the levels and localization of SIDT2 occur at the lesion site of Lewy body diseases in accordance with the progression of Lewy body pathology. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, and may provide clues for improved diagnosis, prevention, and therapeutic intervention for such diseases.",-1
Applications of natural language processing in radiology: A systematic review,"Background:                    Recent advances in performance of natural language processing (NLP) techniques have spurred wider use and more sophisticated applications of NLP in radiology. This study systematically reviews the trends and applications of NLP in radiology within the last five years.              Methods:                    A search of three databases of peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers from January 1, 2016 to April 21, 2021 resulted in a total of 228 publications included in the review. Manuscripts were analyzed by several factors, including clinical application, study setting, NLP technique, and performance.              Results:                    Of the 228 included publications, there was an overall increase in number of studies published with an increase in use of machine learning models. NLP models showed high performance: >50% of publications reported F1 > 0.91. There was variable sample size across the studies with a median of 3708 data points, most commonly radiology reports. 145 studies utilized data from a single academic center. Applications were classified as clinical (n = 87), technical (n = 66), quality improvement (n = 61), research (n = 9), and education (n = 5).              Discussion:                    There has been a continued increase in number of studies involving NLP in radiology. Newer NLP techniques, including word embedding, deep learning, and transformers, are being applied and show improved performance. There has been growth in the interpretative and non-interpretative use of NLP techniques in radiology and has great capacity to improve patient care and delivery. Although the performance and breadth of NLP applications is impressive, there is an overall lack of high-level evidence for actual clinical application of published tools.              Conclusion:                    NLP applications in radiology has been increasing studied and more accurate in the last 5 years. More direct clinical application and portability of the NLP pipelines is need to reach the technology's full potential.",-1
"Preliminary review on the prevalence, proportion, geographical distribution, and characteristics of naturally acquired Plasmodium cynomolgi infection in mosquitoes, macaques, and humans: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background:                    Plasmodium cynomolgi is a simian malaria parasite that has been reported as a naturally acquired human infection. The present study aims to systematically review reports on naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques to provide relevant data for pre-emptive surveillance and preparation in the event of an outbreak of zoonotic malaria in Southeast Asia.              Methods:                    The protocol of the systematic review was registered at PROSPERO with approval ID CRD42020203046. Three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and MEDLINE) were searched for studies reporting the prevalence of P. cynomolgi infections in Southeast Asian countries between 1946 and 2020. The pooled prevalence or pooled proportion of P. cynomolgi parasitemia in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques was estimated using a random-effects model. Differences in the clinical characteristics of P. cynomolgi infections were also estimated using a random-effects model and presented as pooled odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).              Results:                    Thirteen studies reporting on the prevalence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans (3 studies, 21 cases), mosquitoes (3 studies, 28 cases), and macaques (7 studies, 334 cases) were included. The results demonstrated that the pooled proportion of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans was 1% (95% CI, 0.1%, I2, 0%), while the pooled proportion of P. cynomolgi infecting mosquitoes was 18% (95% CI, 10-26%, I2, 32.7%). The pooled prevalence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in macaques was 47% (95% CI, 27-67%, I2, 98.3%). Most of the cases of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans were reported in Cambodia (62%) and Malaysia (38%), while cases of P. cynomolgi in macaques were reported in Malaysia (35.4%), Singapore (23.2%), Indonesia (17.3%), Philippines (8.5%), Laos (7.93%), and Cambodia (7.65%). Cases of P. cynomolgi in mosquitoes were reported in Vietnam (76.9%) and Malaysia (23.1%).              Conclusions:                    This study demonstrated the occurrence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi infection in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques. Further studies of P. cynomolgi in asymptomatic human cases in areas where vectors and natural hosts are endemic are extensively needed if human infections with P. cynomolgi do become public health problems.",-1
Inhibition of Aedes aegypti DNA topoisomerase II by etoposide: Impact on survival and morphology of larvae and pupae,"DNA topoisomerase II enzymes maintain DNA stability during vital processes, such as genome replication, transcription and chromosomal segregation during mitosis and meiosis. In the present work, we analyzed functional aspects of the DNA topoisomerase II (AeTopII) enzyme of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Here, we show that AeTopII mRNA is expressed at all stages of mosquito development. By in situ hybridization, we found that the AeTopII mRNA is concentrated along the ovarian follicular cells as well as in the region of the follicles. The observed expression profiles likely reflect increased topoisomerase II cellular requirements due to the intense ovarian growth and egg production following blood feeding in Ae. aegypti females. The drug etoposide, a classic inhibitor of topoisomerase II, was used for in vivo testing with 2nd stage larvae, in order to investigate the functional importance of this enzyme in Ae. aegypti survival and development. Inhibition of topoisomerase II activity with etoposide concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 Î¼M did not leads to the immediate death of larvae. However, after 10 days of observation, etoposide treatments resulted in 30-40% decrease in survival, in a dose dependent manner, with persisting larvae and pupae presenting incomplete development, as well as morphological abnormalities. Also, approximately 50% of the treated larvae did not reach the pupal stage. Thus, we conclude that AeTopII is a vital enzyme in the development of Ae. aegypti and its sensitivity to inhibitors should be explored for potential chemical agents to be used in vector control.",-1
Vector Competence for DENV-2 Among Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) Populations in China,"Aedes albopictus is a vector of over 20 arboviruses that has spread throughout the world, mainly in the second half of the twentieth century. Approximately 50-100 million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes each year, leading to heavy economic burdens for both governments and individuals, among countless other negative consequences. Understanding the vector competence of vector species is critical for effectively preventing and controlling vector-borne diseases. Accordingly, in this study, vector competence was evaluated by quantitative analysis of DENV-2 loads in mosquito tissues (midguts, heads, and salivary glands) and whole mosquitoes through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Wolbachia and the expression of immune-associated genes (Rel1, Rel2, Dicer2, and STAT) in mosquitoes were also detected by RT-qPCR to explore their impact on vector competence. The amount of DENV-2 in the mosquito midguts, heads, and salivary glands from southern-western China were found to be lower than those from eastern-central-northern China. The DENV-2 loads in whole mosquitoes showed a negative correlation with Rel1 gene (r = -0.285, P = 0.011) and STAT gene expression levels (r = -0.289, P = 0.009). In terms of Wolbachia strains, the density of the wAlbB strain was found to be significantly higher than that of the wAlbA strain in the eight Ae. albopictus populations, and the relative density of the wAlbB strain in mosquitoes from southern-western China was higher than those from eastern-central-northern China. The relative density of the wAlbB strain showed a negative correlation with the mean loads of DENV-2 in the heads (r = -0.729, P = 0.040), salivary glands (r = -0.785, P = 0.021), and whole mosquitoes (r = -0.909, P = 0.002). Thus, there are lower DENV-2 loads in the mosquitoes from southern-western China, which may be related to the innate immunity of mosquitoes as affected by Rel1 in the Toll pathway, STAT in the JAK-STAT pathway, and the relative density of the wAlbB strain.",-1
"Modulatory effects of polysaccharides from plants, marine algae and edible mushrooms on gut microbiota and related health benefits: A review","Naturally occurring carbohydrate polymers containing non-starch polysaccharides (NPs) are a class of biomacromolecules isolated from plants, marine algae, and edible mushrooms, and their biological activities has shown potential uses in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. Importantly, NPs serve as prebiotics to provide health benefits to the host through stimulating the proliferation of beneficial gut microbiota (GM) and enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The composition and diversity of GM play a critical role in regulating host health and have been extensively studied in recent years. In this review, the extraction, isolation, purification, and structural characterization of NPs derived from plants, marine algae, and edible mushrooms are outlined. Importantly, the degradation and metabolism of these NPs in the intestinal tract, the effects of NPs on the microbial community and SCFAs generation, and the beneficial effects of NPs on host health by modulating GM are systematically highlighted. Overall, we hope that this review can provide some theoretical references and a new perspective for applications of NPs as prebiotics in functional food and drug development.",-1
Pentraxin 3 deficiency protects from the metabolic inflammation associated to diet-induced obesity,"Aims:                    Low-grade chronic inflammation characterizes obesity and metabolic syndrome. Here, we aim at investigating the impact of the acute-phase protein long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) on the immune-inflammatory response occurring during diet-induced obesity.              Methods and results:                    PTX3 deficiency in mice fed a high-fat diet for 20 weeks protects from weight gain and adipose tissue deposition in visceral and subcutaneous depots. This effect is not related to changes in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism but is associated with an improved immune cell phenotype in the adipose tissue of Ptx3 deficient animals, which is characterized by M2-macrophages polarization and increased angiogenesis. These findings are recapitulated in humans where carriers of a PTX3 haplotype (PTX3 h2/h2 haplotype), resulting in lower PTX3 plasma levels, presented with a reduced prevalence of obesity and decreased abdominal adiposity compared with non-carriers.              Conclusion:                    Our results support a critical role for PTX3 in the onset of obesity by promoting inflammation and limiting adipose tissue vascularization and delineate PTX3 targeting as a valuable strategy for the treatment of adipose tissue-associated inflammatory response.",-1
MiR-4448 is involved in deltamethrin resistance by targeting CYP4H31 in Culex pipiens pallens,"Background:                    Culex pipiens (Cx. pipiens) complex, which acts as a vector of viruses and is widespread and abundant worldwide, including West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Sindbis virus, can cause serious vector-borne diseases affecting human health. Unfortunately, mosquitoes have developed deltamethrin resistance because of its long-term overuse, representing a major challenge to mosquito control. Understanding the molecular regulatory mechanisms of resistance is vital to control mosquitoes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that have been demonstrated to be important regulators of gene expression across a wide variety of organisms, which might function in mosquito deltamethrin resistance. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory functions of miR-4448 and CYP4H31 in the formation of insecticidal resistance in mosquito Culex pipiens pallens.              Methods:                    We used quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR to measure miR-4448 and CYP4H31 (encoding a cytochrome P450) expression levels. The regulatory functions of miR-4448 and CYP4H31 were assessed using dual-luciferase reporter assays. Then, oral feeding, RNA interference, and the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bottle bioassay were used to determine miR-4448's association with deltamethrin resistance by targeting CYP4H31 in vivo. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was also used to detect the viability of pIB/V5-His-CYP4H31-transfected C6/36 cells after deltamethrin treatment in vitro.              Results:                    MiR-4448 was downregulated in the deltamethrin-resistant strain (DR strain), whereas CYP4H31 was downregulated in deltamethrin-susceptible strain. CYP4H31 expression was downregulated by miR-4448 recognizing and binding to its 3' untranslated region. Functional verification experiments showed that miR-4448 overexpression resulted in lower expression of CYP4H31. The mortality of miR-4448 mimic-injected DR strain mosquitoes was higher than that of the controls. CCK-8 assays showed that CYP4H31 decreased cellular resistance to deltamethrin in vitro and the mortality of the DR strain increased when CYP4H31 was knocked down in vivo.              Conclusions:                    In mosquitoes, miR-4448 participates in deltamethrin resistance by targeting CYP4H31. The results of the present study increase our understanding of deltamethrin resistance mechanisms.",-1
Physiological characterization of chitin synthase A responsible for the biosynthesis of cuticle chitin in Culex pipiens pallens (Diptera: Culicidae),"Background:                    The pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes to humans and animals cause several emerging and resurgent infectious diseases. Increasing insecticide resistance requires rational action to control the target vector population. Chitin is indispensable for insect growth and development and absent from vertebrates and higher plants. Chitin synthase A (CHSA) is a crucial enzyme in chitin synthesis; therefore, identifying and characterizing how CHSA determines chitin content may contribute to the development of novel vector control strategies.              Results:                    The injection of small interfering RNA targeting CHSA (siCHSA) to knockdown CHSA transcripts in larval, pupal and adult stages of Culex pipiens pallens resulted in the appearance of different lethal phenotypes. When larval and pupal stages were injected with siCHSA, CHSA knockdown prevented larval molting, pupation and adult eclosion, and affected the production of chitin and chitin degradation, which resulted in an ecdysis defect phenotype of mosquitoes. When siCHSA was injected into mosquitoes in the adult stage, CHSA knockdown also affected the laminar organization of the mesoderm and the formation of pseudo-orthogonal patterns of the large fibers of the endoderm.              Conclusion:                    We provide a systematic and comprehensive description of the effects of CHSA on morphogenesis and metamorphosis. The results show that CHSA not only affects chitin synthesis during molting, but also might be involved in chitin degradation. Our results further show that CHSA is important for the structural integrity of the adult mosquito cuticle.",-1
Melatonin Inhibits Dengue Virus Infection via the Sirtuin 1-Mediated Interferon Pathway,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative pathogen in the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. DENV is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. Approximately 100 million people are infected annually worldwide, and most of those live in tropical and subtropical areas. There is still no effective drug or vaccine for treatment of DENV infection. In this study, we set forth to investigate the effect of melatonin, which is a natural hormone with multiple pharmacological functions, against DENV infection. Treatment with subtoxic doses of melatonin dose-dependently inhibited DENV production. Cross-protection across serotypes and various cell types was also observed. Time-of-addition assay suggested that melatonin exerts its influence during the post-entry step of viral infection. The antiviral activity of melatonin partly originates from activation of the sirtuin pathway since co-treatment with melatonin and the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor reversed the effect of melatonin treatment alone. Moreover, melatonin could modulate the transcription of antiviral genes that aid in suppression of DENV production. This antiviral mechanism of melatonin suggests a possible new strategy for treating DENV infection.",-1
"Lactobacillus plantarum DP189 Reduces Î±-SYN Aggravation in MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Regulating Oxidative Damage, Inflammation, and Gut Microbiota Disorder","This study aimed to evaluate the attenuating effect of Lactobacillus plantarum DP189 on Î±-synuclein (Î±-SYN) aggregates in the substantia nigra (SN) of Parkinson's disease (PD) mice via 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced. Our results indicated that L. plantarum DP189 increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxide (GSH-Px), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²). Moreover, L. plantarum DP189 reduced the Î±-SYN accumulation in SN. Mechanistically, L. plantarum DP189 activated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)/ARE and PGC-1Î± pathways and suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, fecal analysis showed that L. plantarum DP189 reshaped the gut microbiota in PD mice by reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria (Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria) and increased the abundance of probiotics (Lactobacillus and Prevotella). Our results suggested that L. plantarum DP189 could delay the neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of Î±-SYN in the SN of PD mice via suppressing oxidative stress, repressing proinflammatory response, and modulating gut microbiota.",-1
Effect of Varying Molecular Weight of Oat Î²-Glucan Taken just before Eating on Postprandial Glycemic Response in Healthy Humans,"To see if the molecular weight (MW) and viscosity of oat Î²-glucan (OBG) when taken before eating determine its effect on postprandial glycemic responses (PPRG), healthy overnight-fasted subjects (n = 16) were studied on eight separate occasions. Subjects consumed 200 mL water alone (Control) or with 4 g OBG varying in MW and viscosity followed, 2-3 min later, by 113 g white-bread. Blood was taken fasting and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after starting to eat. None of the OBG treatments differed significantly from the Control for the a-priori primary endpoint of glucose peak-rise or secondary endpoint of incremental area-under-the-curve (iAUC) over 0-120 min. However, significant differences from the Control were seen for glucose iAUC over 0-45 min and time to peak (TTP) glucose. Lower log(MW) and log(viscosity) were associated with higher iAUC 0-45 (p < 0.001) and shorter TTP (p < 0.001). We conclude that when 4 g OBG is taken as a preload, reducing MW does not affect glucose peak rise or iAUC0-120, but rather accelerates the rise in blood glucose and reduces the time it takes glucose to reach the peak. However, this is based on post-hoc calculation of iAUC0-45 and TTP and needs to be confirmed in a subsequent study.",-1
Metagenomic analysis of intestinal microbiota in wild rats living in urban and rural habitats,"Mammals have a symbiotic relationship with various microorganisms called microbiota throughout their lives. These microorganisms are known to affect the host's physiology, health, and even mental balance. The development of the gut microbiota is regulated by a complex interaction between host and environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle. Herein, it is aimed to elucidate the differences in the gut microbiota of rats living in urban and rural habitats. The taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota of wild rats belonging to Rattus rattus species caught from urban and rural areas of Western Anatolian (Bilecik province) were examined comparatively by 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing technique. Laboratory rats were used as reference animals. The alpha diversities were found lower in the rural rats with respect to the urban rats, whereas the highest alpha diversity was calculated for laboratory rats. The lower Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratios (F/B ratio) were accounted for both rural and laboratory rats compared with urban rats. The Proteobacteria to Actinobacteria ratio (P/A ratio) was lower for rural rats, but higher for laboratory rats, compared with urban rats. The heatmap analyses of taxonomic units in the microbiota of each group demonstrated distinct patterns at the species and genus levels. The study provided metagenomic data on the gut microbiota of rats residing in urban and rural habitats, offering a different perspective on future environmental biomonitoring studies.",-1
RANKL Impairs the TLR4 Pathway by Increasing TRAF6 and RANK Interaction in Macrophages,"High serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) are found in patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, sepsis, or septic shock and are associated with a high mortality rate in stroke. The primary known function of OPG is to bind to the receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL), and by doing so, it inhibits the binding between RANKL and its receptor (RANK). TLR4 signaling in macrophages involves TRAF6 recruitment and contributes to low-grade chronic inflammation in adipose tissue. LPS is a classical activator of the TLR4 pathway and induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. We have previously observed that in the presence of RANKL, there is no LPS-induced activation of TLR4 in macrophages. In this study, we investigated the crosstalk between RANK and TLR4 pathways in macrophages stimulated with both RANKL and LPS to unveil the role of OPG in inflammatory processes. We found that RANKL inhibits TLR4 activation by binding to RANK, promoting the binding between TRAF6 and RANK, lowering TLR4 activation and the expression of proinflammatory mediators. Furthermore, high OPG levels aggravate inflammation by inhibiting RANKL. Our findings elect RANKL as a candidate for drug development as a way to mitigate the impact of obesity-induced inflammation in patients.",-1
scSemiAE: a deep model with semi-supervised learning for single-cell transcriptomics,"Background:                    With the development of modern sequencing technology, hundreds of thousands of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles allow to explore the heterogeneity in the cell level, but it faces the challenges of high dimensions and high sparsity. Dimensionality reduction is essential for downstream analysis, such as clustering to identify cell subpopulations. Usually, dimensionality reduction follows unsupervised approach.              Results:                    In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method named scSemiAE, which is based on an autoencoder model. It transfers the information contained in available datasets with cell subpopulation labels to guide the search of better low-dimensional representations, which can ease further analysis.              Conclusions:                    Experiments on five public datasets show that, scSemiAE outperforms both unsupervised and semi-supervised baselines whether the transferred information embodied in the number of labeled cells and labeled cell subpopulations is much or less.",-1
Stroke Risk Factors of Stroke Patients in China: A Nationwide Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study,"Background:                    Stroke is the leading cause of death in China, and its burdens are rapidly increasing. The prevalence and control of stroke risk factors among stroke patients in China are unknown.              Objective:                    We investigated the stroke risk factors of stroke patients in China.              Design:                    We examined stroke risk factors in 6580 stroke patients aged 18 years or older in the China National Chronic Diseases and Nutrition Surveillance of Adults (2015-2017). With regard to the basic characteristics of the study participants, categorical variables were described as frequency (percent). The chi-square test was used to analyze the difference between men and women. The multivariate logistic regression model was used in the multivariate analysis.              Results:                    Among the 6580 stroke patients, hypertension was the most common stroke risk factor identified in most cases (78.51%), followed by overweight or obesity (61.58%), dyslipidemia (54.38%), smoking (24.04%), diabetes (21.75%), family history of stroke (17.43%), lack of exercise (16.35%), and atrial fibrillation (4.47%). Drinking stroke patients had a lower rate of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Patients with hyperuricemia had a higher rate of hypertension and dyslipidemia than no-hyperuricemia patients. The hypertension awareness, treatment, and control rates among hypertension stroke patients were 73.62%, 70.19%, and 17.79%, respectively. The diabetes awareness, treatment, and control rates among diabetes patients were 69.74%, 65.83%, and 34.59%, respectively. The dyslipidemia awareness, treatment, and control rates among dyslipidemia patients were 42.37%, 29.4%, and 20.07%, respectively. Among treated hypertension patients, the rates of taking medicine as medically advised, controlled diet, increased exercise, and blood pressure monitoring were 91.31%, 58.88%, 45.78%, and 73.99%, respectively. Among treated diabetes patients, the rates of oral antidiabetic medications, insulin injection, diet control, and blood glucose monitoring were 78.24%, 34.71%, 85.77%, and 78.24%, respectively. Among treated dyslipidemic patients, the rate of taking medicine as medical advice, controlled diet, increased exercise, and regular blood lipid monitoring was 80.61%, 77.57%, 56.46%, and 40.3%, respectively.              Conclusions:                    The most common risk factors for community stroke patients in China are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and overweight or obesity. The stroke community patients' suboptimal awareness and treatment of hypertension, and suboptimal awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes, and dyslipidemia are significant problems in China.",-1
"High intensity interval training (HIIT) produces small improvements in fasting glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance in sedentary older men but not masters athletes","The aim of this study was to investigate whether 6 weeks' high intensity interval training (HIIT; 6 Ã 30 s sprints at 40% peak power, once every five days) following 6 weeks' of aerobic preconditioning could favourably affect fasting insulin, glucose, and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA1-IR) in sedentary older men compared with masters athletes. A secondary aim was to establish whether lifelong exercisers (LEX) exhibited improved fasting insulin, glucose, and HOMA1-IR, compared to sedentary older males (SED). Twenty-two males (62 Â± 2 years) comprised the SED group and 17 males (60 Â± 5 years) were enrolled as LEX. Participants were tested at phase A (baseline), B (after preconditioning), and C (post-HIIT). There was no effect of time (P = 0.116) or interaction (P = 0.727) on insulin. However, there was an effect of group (P < 0.001). In terms of magnitude, HIIT induced a small decrease in SED insulin compared to baseline (15.8 Â± 8.1 uIUÂ·ml-1 at baseline and 14.0 Â± 7.8 uIUÂ·ml-1 post-HIIT; Cohen's d = 0.23) and compared to post-preconditioning (17.5 Â± 9.7 uIUÂ·ml-1; Cohen's d = 0.40). LEX insulin was unchanged throughout (all differences were trivial). Insulin was lower in LEX than SED at phase A (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.31), B (P = 0.023, Cohen's d = 0.78), and C (P = 0.004, Cohen's d = 1.01). There was no effect of time (P = 0.290), group (P = 0.166), or interaction (P = 0.153) for glucose. In terms of magnitude, HIIT produced a small reduction in SED glucose compared to baseline (5.7 Â± 1.3 mmolÂ·l-1 at baseline and 5.3 Â± 0.9 mmolÂ·l-1 post-HIIT; Cohen's d = 0.36), and compared to phase B (5.6 Â± 0.8 mmolÂ·l-1, Cohen's d = 0.35). LEX glucose was unchanged throughout (all changes were trivial). SED had moderately higher blood glucose than LEX at phase A (Cohen's d = 0.49), and B (Cohen's d = 0.63), but only a trivial difference existed at phase C (Cohen's d = 0.15). There was no effect of time (P = 0.110), or interaction (P = 0.569) on HOMA1-IR. However, there was an effect of group (P = 0.002). In terms of magnitude, SED HOMA1-IR was unchanged from phase A to B (4.2 Â± 3.0 and 4.5 Â± 2.9 arbitrary units respectively [Cohen's d = 0.10]). However, at C (3.5 Â± 2.6) there was a small decrease compared to B (Cohen's d = 0.36), and A (Cohen's d = 0.25). LEX experienced a small increase in HOMA1-IR from phase A to B (1.6 Â± 1.3 and 2.3 Â± 2.8 respectively [Cohen's d = 0.32]), followed by a small decrease from B to C (1.7 Â± 1.1 at phase C [Cohen's d = 0.28]), and a trivial change from A to C (Cohen's d = 0.08). HOMA1-IR was lower in LEX than SED at baseline (P = 0.002, Cohen's d = 1.12), after preconditioning (P = 0.024, Cohen's d = 0.77), and post-HIIT (P = 0.014, Cohen's d = 0.90). Results of this study provide preliminary evidence that HIIT preceded by preconditioning can induce small improvements in fasting insulin, glucose, and HOMA1-IR in sedentary older men compared with masters athletes.",-1
"Illness perception, perceived social support and quality of life in patients with diagnosis of cancer","Introduction:                    Research has shown that social support has a significant impact on quality of life. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the relationship between perceived social support, perception of disease and quality of life, and the factors affecting these, in patients with cancer in Turkey.              Methods:                    The study data were collected from two hospitals. Data were collected using the face-to-face interview method from patients diagnosed with cancer between March and August 2018. No sampling was performed, and the entire population was studied.              Results:                    The mean age of the patients in the study was 61.37 Â± 14.89 years. Married patients had better social support than single individuals (t = 2.129; p = 0.035). Significant negative correlation was found between the illness perception scale and total quality of life scale score (r = -0.163; p = 0.026), and physical well-being (r = -0.224; p = 0.002) and social well-being (r = -0.199; p = 0.006) subscales.              Conclusion:                    Patients' social support and quality of life were at moderate levels. Married participants had better social support than single participants, and operated participants had better social support than unoperated participants. As illness perception decreased, quality of life, physical well-being and social well-being increased.",-1
"On the clinical psychologist's role in the time of COVID-19, with particular reference to experience gained in pediatric oncology","Objective:                    The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be developing into a planetary-scale mental health experiment, undermining the foundations of our being human, obliging us to keep physically apart from one another, and inducing us to see other people as a potential threat.              Methods:                    In the world of pediatric oncology, we have found ourselves up against new challenges. In this article, we discuss the difficulties found in conducting psychological support sessions while complying with physical distancing rules, as well as wearing protective face masks, and even gloves; or while using modern remote communication telecommunications.              Results:                    The classic reasons behind requests for psychological support have been compounded by other, novel problems, such as: fewer relational resources for families at home, less chance to socialize, hospital stays with only one parent, the suspension of all teaching and group activities on the ward, economic difficulties caused by the pandemic, the rising levels of family conflictuality and generalized anxiety.              Conclusions:                    It is essential to find new solutions that can be promptly implemented, reconfiguring the way we humanize our hospital wards.",-1
Gut microbiome profiles in Thai healthy pregnant women and its association with types of foods,"Background:                    Gut microbiome colonization during early life is significant for immunological and physiological development. Maternal microbiome is associated with proper development of infants. The aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiome profiles among Thai healthy pregnant women and its associated factors.              Methods:                    A multicenter, open trial prospective study was performed at three hospitals in Northern, Central, and Northeastern regions of Thailand. Thai healthy pregnant women attending antenatal clinics were recruited. Fecal samples of subjects at the third trimester of pregnancy were collected with sterilized techniques. The gut microbiome profiles and bacterial diversity were assessed using 16Ss RNA gene sequencing. Demographic data, dietary intake, and anthropometric data were recorded and analyzed.              Results:                    There were 86 healthy pregnant women. The dominant of gut microbiome profiles were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Pregnant women in the Central region had significantly higher of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae than those in other regions (p < 0.001). Pregnant women in the Northern region significantly consumed more glutinous rice than those in other regions (p < 0.001). Glutinous rice intake was positively correlated with Bacteroidetes (rho = 0.405, p = 0.01) and negatively correlated with Firmicutes (rho = - 0.440, p = 0.001). Alpha diversity was not correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) or gestational weight gain.              Conclusions:                    The gut microbiome profiles mainly found in Thai healthy pregnant women were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The gut microbiome profiles in pregnant women found in this study possibly depended on dietary patterns. Glutinous rice with high amylopectin is probably related to abundance of Bacteroidetes.",-1
Case Report: Transmission of Dengue Virus from a Deceased Donor to a Kidney Transplant Recipient Previously Infected by Dengue Virus,"Since 2018, a dengue epidemic has been ongoing in the French overseas department of Reunion Island, in the Indian Ocean, with more than 25,000 serologically confirmed cases. Currently, three dengue serotypes have been identified in RÃ©union Island (DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3) progressing in the form of epidemic outbreaks. This arbovirus is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and may be responsible for serious clinical forms. To date, very few cases of kidney transplant-related dengue virus infection have been described. Here we report the first case of severe dengue virus infection related to kidney transplantation from a patient previously infected with dengue. Testing for dengue fever with PCR search in donor's urine may help complete the pretransplant assessment in areas where this disease occurs.",-1
Combined therapy with ivermectin and doxycycline can effectively alleviate the cytokine storm of COVID-19 infection amid vaccination drive: A narrative review,"An unprecedented global health crisis has developed due to the emergence of the mysterious coronavirus-2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has resulted in millions of deaths around the globe, as no therapy could control the 'cytokine storm'. Consequently, many vaccines have been developed and several others are being developed for this infection. Although most of the approved vaccines have been highly effective, many developing, and economically poor countries are still deprived of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 due to the unequal distribution of vaccines worldwide. Furthermore, the uncertainty about the effectiveness of the available vaccines against the emerging mutants and variants also remains a matter of concern. Due to the multistep pathogenesis and unique features, combination therapy using safe immunomodulatory and antiviral drugs should be considered as the most effective and acceptable therapeutic regimen for this infection. Based on a thorough assessment of the literature, it was determined that it would be interesting to study the therapeutic potential of ivermectin and doxycycline, given their roles in several biological pathways involved in SARS CoV-2 pathogenesis. Following that, a comprehensive literature search was undertaken using Scopus, Web of Science, and Pubmed, depending on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The present study provides a mechanism and comprehensive report, highlighting the role of combined therapy with ivermectin and doxycycline in alleviating the 'cytokine storm' of COVID-19 infection.",-1
Chitosan Protects Immunosuppressed Mice Against Cryptosporidium parvum Infection Through TLR4/STAT1 Signaling Pathways and Gut Microbiota Modulation,"Cryptosporidium parvum infection is very common in infants, immunocompromised patients, or in young ruminants, and chitosan supplementation exhibits beneficial effects against the infection caused by C. parvum. This study investigated whether chitosan supplementation modulates the gut microbiota and mediates the TLR4/STAT1 signaling pathways and related cytokines to attenuate C. parvum infection in immunosuppressed mice. Immunosuppressed C57BL/6 mice were divided into five treatment groups. The unchallenged mice received a basal diet (control), and three groups of mice challenged with 1 Ã 106 C. parvum received a basal diet, a diet supplemented with 50 mg/kg/day paromomycin, and 1 mg/kg/day chitosan, and unchallenged mice treated with 1 mg/kg/day chitosan. Chitosan supplementation regulated serum biochemical indices and significantly (p < 0.01) reduced C. parvum oocyst excretion in infected mice treated with chitosan compared with the infected mice that received no treatment. Chitosan-fed infected mice showed significantly (p < 0.01) decreased mRNA expression levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) compared to infected mice that received no treatment. Chitosan significantly inhibited TLR4 and upregulated STAT1 protein expression (p < 0.01) in C. parvum-infected mice. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that chitosan supplementation increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes/Bacteroides, while that of Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Defferribacteres, and Firmicutes decreased (p < 0.05). Overall, the findings revealed that chitosan supplementation can ameliorate C. parvum infection by remodeling the composition of the gut microbiota of mice, leading to mediated STAT1/TLR4 up- and downregulation and decreased production of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±, and these changes resulted in better resolution and control of C. parvum infection.",-1
Dynamical Analysis of a Boolean Network Model of the Oncogene Role of lncRNA ANRIL and lncRNA UFC1 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) such as ANRIL and UFC1 have been verified as oncogenic genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is well known that the tumor suppressor microRNA-34a (miR-34a) is downregulated in NSCLC. Furthermore, miR-34a induces senescence and apoptosis in breast, glioma, cervical cancer including NSCLC by targeting Myc. Recent evidence suggests that these two lncRNAs act as a miR-34a sponge in corresponding cancers. However, the biological functions between these two non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have not yet been studied in NSCLC. Therefore, we present a Boolean model to analyze the gene regulation between these two ncRNAs in NSCLC. We compared our model to several experimental studies involving gain- or loss-of-function genes in NSCLC cells and achieved an excellent agreement. Additionally, we predict three positive circuits involving miR-34a/E2F1/ANRIL, miR-34a/E2F1/UFC1, and miR-34a/Myc/ANRIL. Our circuit- perturbation analysis shows that these circuits are important for regulating cell-fate decisions such as senescence and apoptosis. Thus, our Boolean network permits an explicit cell-fate mechanism associated with NSCLC. Therefore, our results support that ANRIL and/or UFC1 is an attractive target for drug development in tumor growth and aggressive proliferation of NSCLC, and that a valuable outcome can be achieved through the miRNA-34a/Myc pathway.",-1
Heritability Enrichment of Immunoglobulin G N-Glycosylation in Specific Tissues,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 60 genetic loci associated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation; however, the causal genes and their abundance in relevant tissues are uncertain. Leveraging data from GWAS summary statistics for 8,090 Europeans, and large-scale expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from the genotype-tissue expression of 53 types of tissues (GTEx v7), we derived a linkage disequilibrium score for the specific expression of genes (LDSC-SEG) and conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). We identified 55 gene associations whose predicted levels of expression were significantly associated with IgG N-glycosylation in 14 tissues. Three working scenarios, i.e., tissue-specific, pleiotropic, and coassociated, were observed for candidate genetic predisposition affecting IgG N-glycosylation traits. Furthermore, pathway enrichment showed several IgG N-glycosylation-related pathways, such as asparagine N-linked glycosylation, N-glycan biosynthesis and transport to the Golgi and subsequent modification. Through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), most genetic variants underlying TWAS hits were found to be correlated with health measures (height, waist-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure) and diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and Parkinson's disease, which are related to IgG N-glycosylation. Our study provides an atlas of genetic regulatory loci and their target genes within functionally relevant tissues, for further studies on the mechanisms of IgG N-glycosylation and its related diseases.",-1
Assigning diagnosis codes using medication history,"Diagnosis assignment is the process of assigning disease codes to patients. Automatic diagnosis assignment has the potential to validate code assignments, correct erroneous codes, and register completion. Previous methods build on text-based techniques utilizing medical notes but are inapplicable in the absence of these notes. We propose using patients' medication data to assign diagnosis codes. We present a proof-of-concept study using medical data from an American dataset (MIMIC-III) and Danish nationwide registers to train a machine-learning-based model that predicts an extensive collection of diagnosis codes for multiple levels of aggregation over a disease hierarchy. We further suggest a specialized loss function designed to utilize the innate hierarchical nature of the disease hierarchy. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of 567 disease codes. Moreover, we investigate the technique's generalizability and transferability by (1) training and testing models on the same subsets of disease codes over the two medical datasets and (2) training models on the American dataset while evaluating them on the Danish dataset, respectively. Results demonstrate the proposed method can correctly assign diagnosis codes on multiple levels of aggregation from the disease hierarchy over the American dataset with recall 70.0% and precision 69.48% for top-10 assigned codes; thereby being comparable to text-based techniques. Furthermore, the specialized loss function performs consistently better than the non-hierarchical state-of-the-art version. Moreover, results suggest the proposed method is language and dataset-agnostic, with initial indications of transferability over subsets of disease codes.",-1
Metformin versus SGLT-2 inhibitors: how low can we go?,"The progression of chronic kidney disease is difficult to stop once established. Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors show promise, but clinical trials with a head-to-head comparison in patients with more advanced (stage 3b-4) chronic kidney disease are largely lacking, partly for safety reasons. In this issue, Corremans et al. compare the effects of metformin and canagliflozin in rats with adenine-induced moderate (stage 2-4) chronic kidney disease. Metformin halted progression, whereas canagliflozin did not. This commentary puts the results in a wider clinical context.",-1
Agent-based modeling of malaria control through mosquito aquatic habitats management in a traditional sub-Sahara grouping,"Background:                    Africans pour dirty water around their houses which constitutes aquatic habitats (AH). These AH are sought by mosquitoes for larval development. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of destroying AH around houses in reducing malaria incidence. An agent-based model is proposed for controlling malaria's incidence through population sensitizing campaigns on the harmful effects of AH around houses.              Methods:                    The environment is constituted of houses, AH, mosquitoes, humans, and hospital. Malaria's spread dynamic is linked to the dynamics of humans and mosquitoes. The mosquito's dynamic is represented by egg-laying and seeking blood. The human's dynamic is animated by hitting mosquitoes. AH are destroyed each time by 10% of their starting number. The number of infected humans varied from 0-90 which led to a total of 1001 simulations.              Results:                    When the number of houses and AH is equal, the results are approximate as the field data. At each reduction of AH, the incidence and prevalence tend more and more towards 0. When there is no AH and infected humans, the prevalence and incidence are at 0.              Conclusions:                    When there is no AH site, the disease disappears completely. Global destruction of AH in an environment and using many parameters in the same model are recommended.",-1
Early Treatment Consideration in Patients with Hepatitis B 'e' Antigen-Positive Chronic Infection: Is It Time for a Paradigm Shift?,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, due to the adverse sequelae of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, antiviral therapy has been reserved for patients with ostensibly active liver disease, fibrosis or cirrhosis, and/or increased risk of HCC. Historically, patients with hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic infection, were not offered antiviral therapy. Nevertheless, there has been compelling evidence emerging in recent years, demonstrating that this disease phase is in fact not characterized by immunological tolerance. HBV integration into the human genome is a frequent event found in these patients. Additionally, it may well be associated with active inflammation and fibrosis, even in the presence of persistently normal liver enzymes. Likewise, it appears that the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis are already present during this early stage of the disease. This was reflected in the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, where treating patients above the age of 30 years with HBeAg-positive chronic infection was proposed. Lowering the treatment threshold to broaden treatment eligibility is likely to slow disease progression and reduce the risk of developing HCC. The current review discusses the reasons to consider early antiviral therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic infection.",-1
Factors Related to Personal Resiliency in Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Adolescents,"Hearing loss is a risk factor for a child's appropriate psychosocial development but is not a risk factor for the development of resiliency. Thus, the aim of this research was to determine the level of resiliency, as well as its relation to internal and external factors, in deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) adolescents. The sample included 55 DHH students, 12-14 years of age. Resiliency Scales for Children & Adolescents was used in this research. The obtained results showed that DHH students perceived their resiliency in the average range, except in subscales: Self-efficacy (within Sense of Mastery Scale), Social Support (within Sense of Relatedness Scale), Impairment (within Emotional Reactivity Scale) in which the results were within a higher range, and Recovery (within Emotional Reactivity Scale) in which the results were in a lower range.",-1
Akkermansia muciniphila Ameliorates Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury by Regulating Gut Microbial Composition and Metabolism,"The gut microbiota drives individual sensitivity to excess acetaminophen (APAP)-mediated hepatotoxicity. It has been reported that the bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila protects hosts against liver disease via the liver-gut axis, but its therapeutic potential for drug-induced liver injury remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of A. muciniphila on APAP-induced liver injury and the underlying mechanism. Administration of A. muciniphila efficiently alleviated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and reduced the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). A. muciniphila significantly attenuated APAP-induced oxidative stress and the inflammatory response, as evidenced by restoration of the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) balance, enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, and alleviation of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration. Moreover, A. muciniphila maintained gut barrier function, reshaped the perturbed microbial community and promoted short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) secretion. The beneficial effects of A. muciniphila were accompanied by alterations in hepatic gene expression at the transcriptional level and activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Our results suggested that A. muciniphila could be a potential pretreatment for APAP-induced liver injury. IMPORTANCE Our work revealed that A. muciniphila attenuated APAP-induced liver injury by alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver, and its hepatoprotective effect was accompanied by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and mediated by regulation of the composition and metabolic function of the intestinal microbiota. This finding suggested that the microbial community is a non-negligible impact on drug metabolism and probiotic administration could be a potential therapy for drug-induced liver injury.",-1
Gut microbiota modulates osteoclast glutathione synthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in mice subjected to ovariectomy,"Objectives:                    Osteoporosis is a common bone disease in the elderly mainly regulated by osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs). The gut microbiota has been recognized as an important factor in many physiological and pathological processes in the host. Thus, we hypothesize that the gut microbiota is necessary for postmenopausal osteoporosis and that germ-free (GF) mice are protected from osteoporosis.              Material and methods:                    Osteoporosis models were established by performing ovariectomy (OVX) in mice. Bone mass was measured by micro-CT, and gut microbiota were assessed by 16s rDNA sequencing. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining in vivo and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining in vitro.              Results:                    Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the intestine are pivotal in OC differentiation, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) is a specific indicator of osteoporosis. Furthermore, we found that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes affect the de novo synthesis of glutathione (GSH) by regulating its key enzyme glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (Gclc) and inhibiting mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS accumulation via the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) pathway. In addition, supplementing OVX mice with the probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius LI01 from the Firmicutes phylum prevented osteoporosis.              Conclusions:                    Our results reveal that GSH plays a vital role in OVX-induced bone loss, and probiotics that affect GSH metabolism are potential therapeutic targets for overcoming osteoporosis.",-1
Associations of different body fat deposits with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations,"Background & aims:                    Obesity is a well-established risk factor of vitamin D deficiency. However, it is unclear which fat deposit is most strongly related to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations. Our aim was to distinguish the specific contributions of total body fat (TBF), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (aSAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and hepatic fat on 25(OH)D concentrations.              Methods:                    We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, a population-based cohort study. We used linear regression analyses to examine associations of TBF, aSAT, VAT (n = 2441) and hepatic fat (n = 1980) with 25(OH)D concentrations. Standardized values were used to compare the different fat deposits.              Results:                    Mean (SD) age and 25(OH)D concentrations of the study population was 56 (6) years and 70.8 (24.2) nmol/L, respectively. TBF was inversely associated with 25(OH)D concentrations in women, but not in men. One percent higher TBF was associated with 0.40 nmol/L (95%CI: -0.67 to -0.13) lower 25(OH)D. aSAT was not associated with 25(OH)D concentrations. One cm2 higher VAT was associated with 0.05 nmol/L (-0.09 to -0.02) lower 25(OH)D in men, and 0.06 nmol/L (-0.10 to -0.01) lower 25(OH)D in women. Hepatic fat was only associated with 25(OH)D in men. A tenfold increase in hepatic fat was associated with 6.21 nmol/L (-10.70 to -1.73) lower 25(OH)D. Regressions with standardized values showed VAT was most strongly related to 25(OH)D.              Conclusions:                    In women, TBF and VAT were inversely related to 25(OH)D concentrations. In men, VAT and hepatic fat were inversely related to 25(OH)D concentrations. In both groups, VAT was most strongly associated with 25(OH)D concentrations.",-1
Interferon regulatory factor 5âinduced upregulation of zincâfinger protein 217 promotes pancreatic carcinoma progression,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of zincâfinger protein 217 (ZNF217) in pancreatic carcinoma (PC) progression. ZNF217âassociated expression and survival data from patients with PC were retrieved from the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis server. The mRNA expression level of ZNF217 was detected by reverse transcriptionâquantitative PCR. Cell Counting Kitâ?, colony formation, woundâhealing and Transwell assays were conducted to assess cellular proliferation, migratory and invasive abilities. Proliferation was also examined by immunofluorescence detection of Ki67 expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were performed to detect the interaction between ZNF217 and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5). ZNF217 was found to be significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and cancer cell lines, which was associated with a poor survival rate in patients with PC. ZNF217 silencing markedly suppressed cellular proliferation and migratory and invasive abilities, as well as decreased the expression of Ki67. IRF5 was also upregulated in PC tumor tissues and was shown to positively regulate the activity of the ZNF217 promoter and its mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, ChIP assays demonstrated that IRF5 bound to the promoter region of ZNF217 in vitro. In conclusion, ZNF217 silencing exerted notable inhibitory effects on the progression of PC. Thus, ZNF217 may serve as a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies for PC.",-1
The effect of dopamine agonists on metabolic variables in adults with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review with meta analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized clinical trials,"Aim:                    To assess the metabolic effects of dopamine agonists compared with placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with type 2 diabetes.              Materials and methods:                    Eligible trials were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and CENTRAL. The primary outcomes were HbA1c and serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed at longest available follow-up. Secondary outcomes were fasting plasma glucose, adverse events, body weight, hypoglycaemia and triglycerides. We assessed risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of the evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).              Results:                    Nine RCTs enrolling 3456 participants were included, six of which assessed the effect of bromocriptine, and the other three the effect of cabergoline. Dopamine agonists reduced HbA1c with 0.69 standardized mean difference (95% CI = 0.28 to 1.09; P = .0008; I2 = 80%; GRADE: low) compared with placebo. There was no difference in the effect between bromocriptine and cabergoline. Heterogeneity was partly explained by dosage and study duration, both of which were inversely associated with effect size. Only one large trial reported SAEs and no difference was reported for the risk of an SAE (RR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.12; P = .32) between active intervention and placebo. Secondary outcomes suggested a decrease in fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides and no effect on the remaining outcomes.              Conclusion:                    Dopamine agonists reduce HbA1c as well as fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides in patients with type 2 diabetes without causing SAEs. These data are based on moderate to low quality evidence thus our confidence in the effect estimates is limited.",-1
Molecular Mechanism of Cinnamomum cassia against Gastric Damage and Identification of Active Compounds,"Cinnamomum&amp;nbsp;cassia is a natural product found in plants that has been used as a folk remedy for inflammation. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of C.&amp;nbsp;cassia extract (ECC) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine RAW 264.7 cells, in comparison with 4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, a C. cassia extract component. ECC and 4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibited the production of nitrite oxide in a dose-dependent manner and did not show any change in cellular toxicity when treated with the same dose as that used in the nitrite assay. Moreover, they attenuated ROS accumulation after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. ECC and 4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of inflammatory mediators (iNOS and COX-2) and cytokines such as TNF and IL-6. We also found that ECC and 4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde mitigated the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and transcription factors, such as NF-ÎºB and STAT3, suppressing NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation in LPS-activated macrophages. In addition, administration of ECC in a Sprague Dawley rat model of acute gastric injury caused by indomethacin significantly increased the gastric mucus volume. Analysis of serum and tissue levels of inflammatory mediators revealed a significant decrease in serum PGE2 and myeloperoxidase levels and a reduction in gastric iNOS, COX-2, and p65 protein levels. Collectively, these results suggest that ECC has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and is a potential candidate for curing gastritis.",-1
Metabolomics Profiling of Visceral Adipose Tissue: Results From MESA and the NEO Study,"Background Identifying associations between serum metabolites and visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) could provide novel biomarkers of VAT and insights into the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. We aimed to discover and replicate metabolites reflecting pathways related to VAT . Methods and Results Associations between fasting serum metabolites and VAT area (by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed with cross-sectional linear regression of individual-level data from participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; discovery, N=1103) and the NEO (Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity) study (replication, N=2537). Untargeted 1H nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics profiling of serum was performed in MESA, and metabolites were replicated in the NEO study using targeted 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A total of 30 590 metabolomic spectral variables were evaluated. After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking, physical activity, glucose/lipid-lowering medication, and body mass index, 2104 variables representing 24 nonlipid and 49 lipid/lipoprotein subclass metabolites remained significantly associated with VAT ( P=4.88Ã10-20-1.16Ã10-3). These included conventional metabolites, amino acids, acetylglycoproteins, intermediates of glucose and hepatic metabolism, organic acids, and subclasses of apolipoproteins, cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides. Metabolites mapped to 31 biochemical pathways, including amino acid substrate use/metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. In the replication cohort, acetylglycoproteins, branched-chain amino acids, lactate, glutamine (inversely), and atherogenic lipids remained associated with VAT ( P=1.90Ã10-35-8.46Ã10-7), with most associations remaining after additional adjustment for surrogates of VAT (glucose level, waist circumference, and serum triglycerides), reflecting novel independent associations. Conclusions We identified and replicated a metabolite panel associated with VAT in 2 community-based cohorts. These findings persisted after adjustment for body mass index and appear to define a metabolic signature of visceral adiposity.",-1
CT-Quantified Adipose Tissue Distribution: Risk or Protective Factor for Complications after Rectal Cancer Surgery?,"Purpose:                    Obesity is associated with increased incidence and mortality in rectal cancer (RC). However, an obesity paradox in the sense of a protective effect of obesity is discussed controversially. We evaluated whether adipose tissue distribution has an impact on medical (MC) and surgical complications (SC) after RC surgery.              Methods:                    A total of 296 RC patients underwent oncological surgery and multidetector CT with quantification of total (TAT), visceral (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Logistic regressions on SC (anastomotic leakage [n = 26], wound infection [n = 58], bleeding [n = 12], abscess [n = 32], bladder dysfunction [n = 24], burst abdomen [n = 10]), and MC (pulmonary [n = 22], cardiac [n = 18], urinary tract infection [n = 9], sepsis [n = 5]) were performed.              Results:                    High pelvicVAT was associated with reduced risk for overall SC (OR = 0.915, p = 0.012) and anastomotic leakage (OR = 0.587, p = 0.024, CI: 0.369/0.934). In contrast, CT-quantified obesity was associated with increased risk for wound infection, bladder dysfunction, burst abdomen, overall MC, and cardiac complications (ORs up to 1.423). BMI was not associated with any SC or MC.              Conclusion:                    An obesity paradox with a protective effect of CT-quantified adipose tissue was confirmed for anastomotic leakage and overall SC. In contrast, high adipose tissue was associated with higher risk for other SC and MC. These results show a more complex influence of body composition on MC and SC. CT-quantified obesity is able to provide deeper insights to explain the obesity paradox beyond BMI.",-1
hUC-MSCs lyophilized powder loaded polysaccharide ulvan driven functional hydrogel for chronic diabetic wound healing,"In this study, we used the polysaccharide ulvan from the green macroalgae Ulva fenestrata to prepare the hydrogel for chronic diabetic wound healing. A natural polysaccharide-based hydrogel matrix (UC-DPA-Ag hydrogel) was prepared using ulvan dialdehyde, chitosan, dopamine (DPA) and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell lyophilized powder (hUC-MSCs) was loaded into the hydrogel to develop a novel chronic diabetic wound healing material (UC-DPA-Ag@hUC-MSCs). The resulting hydrogel features adequate mechanical properties, swelling capability, adhesiveness, antioxidant, antibacterial ability, and promoting cell proliferation and migration. In vivo wound healing in type II diabetic mellitus mouse wound model showed that hUC-MSCs loaded UC-DPA-Ag hydrogel could accelerate wound healing effectively. This advanced hydrogel provides a facile and effective way for diabetic chronic wound management. Furthermore, it offers a new route for the utilizing Ulva as a valuable biomaterial for the global and large-scale production of valued added biomaterials.",-1
A Comprehensive Review of Various Diabetic Prediction Models: A Literature Survey,"Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by a high amount of glucose in the blood and can cause too many complications also in the body, such as internal organ failure, retinopathy, and neuropathy. According to the predictions made by WHO, the figure may reach approximately 642 million by 2040, which means one in a ten may suffer from diabetes due to unhealthy lifestyle and lack of exercise. Many authors in the past have researched extensively on diabetes prediction through machine learning algorithms. The idea that had motivated us to present a review of various diabetic prediction models is to address the diabetic prediction problem by identifying, critically evaluating, and integrating the findings of all relevant, high-quality individual studies. In this paper, we have analysed the work done by various authors for diabetes prediction methods. Our analysis on diabetic prediction models was to find out the methods so as to select the best quality researches and to synthesize the different researches. Analysis of diabetes data disease is quite challenging because most of the data in the medical field are nonlinear, nonnormal, correlation structured, and complex in nature. Machine learning-based algorithms have been ruled out in the field of healthcare and medical imaging. Diabetes mellitus prediction at an early stage requires a different approach from other approaches. Machine learning-based system risk stratification can be used to categorize the patients into diabetic and controls. We strongly recommend our study because it comprises articles from various sources that will help other researchers on various diabetic prediction models.",-1
A survival analysis based volatility and sparsity modeling network for student dropout prediction,"Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) is pivotal in mitigating withdrawals in Massive Open Online Courses. Previous studies generally modeled the SDP problem as a binary classification task, providing a single prediction outcome. Accordingly, some attempts introduce survival analysis methods to achieve continuous and consistent predictions over time. However, the volatility and sparsity of data always weaken the models' performance. Prevailing solutions rely heavily on data pre-processing independent of predictive models, which are labor-intensive and may contaminate authentic data. This paper proposes a Survival Analysis based Volatility and Sparsity Modeling Network (SAVSNet) to address these issues in an end-to-end deep learning framework. Specifically, SAVSNet smooths the volatile time series by convolution network while preserving the original data information using Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). Furthermore, we propose a Time-Missing-Aware LSTM unit to mitigate the impact of data sparsity by integrating informative missingness patterns into the model. A survival analysis loss function is adopted for parameter estimation, and the model outputs monotonically decreasing survival probabilities. In the experiments, we compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods in two real-world MOOC datasets, and the experiment results show the effectiveness of our proposed model.",-1
Mobile perceived trust mediation on the intention and adoption of FinTech innovations using mobile technology: A systematic literature review,"The banking and financial sectors have witnessed a significant development recently due to financial technology (FinTech), and it has become an essential part of the financial system. Many factors helped the development of this sector, including the pandemics such as Covid-19, the considerable increasing market value of the FinTech sector worldwide, and new technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobile technology. Moreover, changes in consumer's preferences, especially the Z-generation (digital generation). FinTech shifted the traditional business models to mobile platforms characterized by ease of access and swift transactions. Mobile technology became the main backbone for FinTech innovations and acts as a channel to deliver FinTech services that overcome all geographical and timing barriers, thus enhancing financial inclusion. Mobile perceived Trust (MPT), or the trust in using financial business models via mobile technology, is a crucial factor in the FinTech context that has mediation effects on the intention and adoption of different FinTech business models. Unfortunately, few studies have explored MPT mediations on consumers' intention to adopt FinTech innovations using mobile technology. Typically, many studies examined trust/MPT as an independent and unidirectional variable and investigated its effects on behaviour intention without predicting its mediation effects. This study aimed to develop a systematic literature review on MPT mediation in FinTech, focusing on the period from 2016 and 2021, in journals ranked Q1 and Q2, and known-based theories such as the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and the mobile technology acceptance model. This study found that only four articles were published in Q1 and Q2 journals. In these articles, the MPT was used as a mediator, and its effects were measured on the intention and adoption of the behaviour.",-1
Abnormal accumulation of lipid droplets in neurons induces the conversion of alpha-Synuclein to proteolytic resistant forms in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-synuclein (Î±Syn) aggregation and associated with abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The accumulation of lipids in cytoplasmic organelles called lipid droplets (LDs) was observed in cellular models of PD. To investigate the pathophysiological consequences of interactions between Î±Syn and proteins that regulate the homeostasis of LDs, we used a transgenic Drosophila model of PD, in which human Î±Syn is specifically expressed in photoreceptor neurons. We first found that overexpression of the LD-coating proteins Perilipin 1 or 2 (dPlin1/2), which limit the access of lipases to LDs, markedly increased triacylglyclerol (TG) loaded LDs in neurons. However, dPlin-induced-LDs in neurons are independent of lipid anabolic (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1/midway, fatty acid transport protein/dFatp) and catabolic (brummer TG lipase) enzymes, indicating that alternative mechanisms regulate neuronal LD homeostasis. Interestingly, the accumulation of LDs induced by various LD proteins (dPlin1, dPlin2, CG7900 or KlarsichtLD-BD) was synergistically amplified by the co-expression of Î±Syn, which localized to LDs in both Drosophila photoreceptor neurons and in human neuroblastoma cells. Finally, the accumulation of LDs increased the resistance of Î±Syn to proteolytic digestion, a characteristic of Î±Syn aggregation in human neurons. We propose that Î±Syn cooperates with LD proteins to inhibit lipolysis and that binding of Î±Syn to LDs contributes to the pathogenic misfolding and aggregation of Î±Syn in neurons.",-1
FTX Attenuates Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting Apoptosis and Oxidative Stress via miR-186-5p/MDM4 Pathway,"LncRNA five prime to Xist (FTX) has been identified to exert a protective effect in multiple diseases. However, whether and how FTX attenuates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CI/RI) is still unclear. To simulate CI/RI, an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) HT22 cell model and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) Sprague-Dawley rat model were respectively constructed. In CI/RI plasma samples, OGD/R-challenged HT22 cells, and brain tissues from MCAO/R rats, FTX and mouse double minute 4 (MDM4) expressions were substantially decreased while miR-186-5p abundance was evidently increased. It was also revealed that FTX obviously improved neuronal damage induced by OGD/R through increasing proliferation, reducing apoptosis, and alleviating oxidative stress in OGD/R-challenged HT22 cells. Additionally, FTX positively regulated MDM4 level in OGD/R-treated HT22 cells as a sponge of miR-186-5p. Moreover, miR-186-5p upregulation or MDM4 suppression restored the inhibitory effects of FTX upregulation on OGD/R-triggered neuronal damage in HT22 cells. Therefore, these results suggest that FTX might ameliorate CI/RI by regulating the miR-186-5p/MDM4 pathway, providing a new target for stroke impairment treatment.",-1
Understanding the dimensions of sport-injury related growth: A DELPHI method approach,"Despite the multitude of adverse physical and psychosocial consequences of sports injury, evidence also highlights the potential for positive benefits in the injury aftermath. The purpose of this study is to address this gap by exploring the dimensions of personal growth following a severe sports injury. A 3-rounds e-Delphi method was utilized to develop a consensual understanding of the dimensions of sport-injury related growth. A panel of 24 psychology of sport injury experts participated in the process. The final list of items obtained was subjected to conventional content analysis to identify general themes. The process led to the development of a 5-dimension model capable of describing athletes' experiences of personal growth following a severe sports-related injury: personal strength, improved social life, health benefits, sport benefits, and social support and recognition. The domains of sport-injury related growth identified here are consistent with growth-domains identified in previous personal growth literature. However, they also highlight the importance of contextualizing the experience of growth. We have captured key elements of sport-injury related growth, domains that can be used as the basis for further psychometric testing and for further interventions to increase adjustment and well-being during the rehabilitation process.",-1
Vitamin D supplementation in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review,"Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic disorder characterized by exacerbation and remission periods, and its worldwide incidence has increased in recent decades. Vitamin D is involved in immune regulation and improves barrier functions and intestinal microbiota. Studies have observed that high vitamin D levels decrease relapses and improve the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of this review was to analyze the evidence on vitamin D supplementation in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Among inactive patients, the studies administrating less than 2000 international units per day of vitamin D did not find any beneficial effects. However, those supplementing 2000 international units of vitamin D per day increased serum levels and reduced disease activity. In patients with active disease, doses between 5000 to 10 000 international units per day reduced symptomatology. This review showed that vitamin D supplementation above 2000 international units per day among inactive patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and between 5000 to 10 000 international units per day among those in the active stage, shows potential benefits on the disease.",-1
Insecticide resistance status in Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) in coastal Kenya,"Background:                    The rapid and widespread evolution of insecticide resistance has emerged as one of the major challenges facing malaria control programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the insecticide resistance status of mosquito populations and the underlying mechanisms of insecticide resistance can inform the development of effective and site-specific strategies for resistance prevention and management. The aim of this study was to investigate the insecticide resistance status of Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes from coastal Kenya.              Methods:                    Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) larvae sampled from eight study sites were reared to adulthood in the insectary, and 3- to 5-day-old non-blood-fed females were tested for susceptibility to permethrin, deltamethrin, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), fenitrothion and bendiocarb using the standard World Health Organization protocol. PCR amplification of rDNA intergenic spacers was used to identify sibling species of the An. gambiae complex. The An. gambiae (s.l.) females were further genotyped for the presence of the L1014S and L1014F knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations by real-time PCR.              Results:                    Anopheles arabiensis was the dominant species, accounting for 95.2% of the total collection, followed by An. gambiae (s.s.), accounting for 4.8%. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes were resistant to deltamethrin, permethrin and fenitrothion but not to bendiocarb and DDT. The L1014S kdr point mutation was detected only in An. gambiae (s.s.), at a low allelic frequency of 3.33%, and the 1014F kdr mutation was not detected in either An. gambiae (s.s.) or An. arabiensis.              Conclusion:                    The findings of this study demonstrate phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids and organophosphates and a low level of the L1014S kdr point mutation that may partly be responsible for resistance to pyrethroids. This knowledge may inform the development of insecticide resistance management strategies along the Kenyan Coast.",-1
"Incidence, drivers and global health implications of the 2019/2020 yellow fever sporadic outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa","The 2019 and 2020 sporadic outbreaks of yellow fever (YF) in Sub-Saharan African countries had raised a lot of global health concerns. This article aims to narratively review the vector biology, YF vaccination program, environmental factors and climatic changes, and to understand how they could facilitate the reemergence of YF. This study comprehensively reviewed articles that focused on the interplay and complexity of YF virus (YFV) vector diversity/competence, YF vaccine immunodynamics and climatic change impacts on YFV transmission as they influence the 2019/2020 sporadic outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Based on available reports, vectorial migration, climatic changes and YF immunization level could be reasons for the re-mergence of YF at the community and national levels. Essentially, the drivers of YFV infection due to spillover are moderately constant. However, changes in land use and landscape have been shown to influence sylvan-to-urban spillover. Furthermore, increased precipitation and warmer temperatures due to climate change are likely to broaden the range of mosquitoes' habitat. The 2019/2020 YF outbreaks in SSA is basically a result of inadequate vaccination campaigns, YF surveillance and vector control. Consequently, and most importantly, adequate immunization coverage must be implemented and properly achieved under the responsibility of the public health stakeholders.",-1
"Comparing the effects of ipragliflozin versus metformin on visceral fat reduction and metabolic dysfunction in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin: A prospective, multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomized controlled study (PRIME-V study)","A prospective, multicentre, open-label, blinded-endpoint, randomized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with ipragliflozin (sodium-dependent glucose transporter-2 inhibitor) versus metformin for visceral fat reduction and glycaemic control among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sitagliptin, HbA1c levels of 7%-10%, and body mass index (BMI) â?22 kg/m2 . Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ipragliflozin 50 mg or metformin 1000-1500 mg daily. The primary outcome was change in visceral fat area as measured by computed tomography after 24 weeks of therapy. The secondary outcomes were effects on glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism. Mean percentage reduction in visceral fat area was significantly greater in the ipragliflozin group than in the metformin group (-12.06% vs. -3.65%, P = 0.040). Ipragliflozin also significantly reduced BMI, subcutaneous fat area, waist circumference, fasting insulin, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-resistance, and increased HDL-cholesterol levels. Metformin significantly reduced HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol levels and increased HOMA-beta. There were no severe adverse events. The use of ipragliflozin or metformin in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, widely used in Japan, may have beneficial effects in ameliorating multiple cardiovascular risk factors.",-1
A Clinical Investigation on the Theragnostic Effect of MicroRNA Biomarkers for Survival Outcome in Cervical Cancer: A PRISMA-P Compliant Protocol for Systematic Review and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis,"Background:                    The most often diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide is cancer of the cervix. It is also the most prevalent kind of gynecological cancer in women. This cancer originates in the opening of the cervix and spreads through sexual contact. Even though human papillomavirus (HPV) may not cause cancer immediately, it does develop over time as a result of the virus's lengthy persistence to cause dysplastic changes overtime, particularly in high-risk kinds. The primary objective of this research is to see if miRNAs are dysregulated as a result of treatment resistance in cervical cancer (CC). The aim is to see if these microRNAs may be utilized as biomarkers for detecting chemoresistance in CC, particularly for clinical applications.              Methods:                    The recommended protocol for comprehensive study and meta-analysis (PRISMA-P) standards will be utilized for the analysis and data interpretation. The bibliographic databases will be methodically searched using a combination of search keywords. Based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria, the acquired findings will be reviewed, and data retrieved from the selected scientific papers for systematic review. We will then construct a forest from the pooled Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% C.I. values, data obtained using the random-effects model.              Discussion:                    The focus of this study is to identify the function of miRNAs as a chemoresistance regulator and determine if they have the potential scope to be considered as biomarkers for cervical cancer. Through this systematic review and meta-analysis, the goal is to collect, compare, and analyze the data pertaining to the role of miRNAs in cervical cancer, thereby, enabling us to understand the role they play in chemosensitivity.",-1
"Activity of Some Plant and Fungal Metabolites towards Aedes albopictus (Diptera, Culicidae)","Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is a widespread mosquito, a vector of important human arboviruses, including Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika. It is an extremely difficult species to control even for the onset of resistances to chemicals insecticides, therefore ecofriendly products are urgently needed. In this study, the activity of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids and some of their semisynthetic derivatives, of 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and two analogues, of cyclopaldic acid and epi-epoformin on the survival and development of Ae. albopictus larvae was evaluated. First-instar larval exposure for 24 and 48 h to cyclopaldic acid, resulted in mortality mean per-centage of 82.4 and 96.9 respectively; 1,2-O,O-diacetyllycorine 48h post-treatment caused 84.7% mortality. Larval and pupal duration were proved to decrease significantly when larvae were exposed to cyclopaldic acid, 1,2-O,O-diacetyllycorine and N-methyllycorine iodide. The mean number of third-instar larvae surviving to 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was significantly lower than the number of correspondent control larvae over the time. This study indicated that 1,2-O,O'-diacetyllycorine, N-methyllycorine iodide, cyclopaldic acid and 1,4-naphthoquinone structural derivatives have good potential for developing bioinsecticides for mosquito control programs. The obtained results are of general interest due to the global importance of the seri-ous human diseases such a vector is able to spread.",-1
RA Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes Derived Extracellular Vesicles Promote Angiogenesis by miRNA-1972 Targeting p53/mTOR Signaling in Vascular Endotheliocyte,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammatory in joints. Invasive pannus is a characteristic pathological feature of RA. RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are showed tumor-like biological characters that facilitate pannus generation. Importantly, it has been documented that extracellular vesicle (EVs) derived microRNAs have a vital role of angiogenesis in various immune inflammatory diseases. However, whether RA FLSs derived EVs can facilitate angiogenesis and the underlying mechanism is undefined. Herein, we aim to investigate the key role of RA FLSs derived EVs on angiogenesis in endothelial cells (ECs). We indicate that RA FLSs derived EVs promote ECs angiogenesis by enhancing migration and tube formation of ECs in vitro. Also, we confirm that RA FLSs derived EVs can significantly facilitate ECs angiogenesis with a matrigel angiogenesis mice model. In terms of the mechanisms, both RNAs and proteins in EVs play roles in promoting ECs angiogenesis, but the RNA parts are more fundamental in this process. By combining microRNA sequencing and qPCR results, miR-1972 is identified to facilitate ECs angiogenesis. The blockage of miR-1972 significantly abrogated the angiogenesis stimulative ability of RA FLSs derived EVs in ECs, while the overexpression of miR-1972 reversed the effect in ECs. Specifically, the p53 level is decreased, and the phosphorylated mTOR is upregulated in miR-1972 overexpressed ECs, indicating that miR-1972 expedites angiogenesis through p53/mTOR pathway. Collectively, RA FLSs derived EVs can promote ECs angiogenesis via miR-1972 targeted p53/mTOR signaling, targeting on RA FLSs derived EVs or miR-1972 provides a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with RA.",-1
Impact of Epithelial Cell Shedding on Intestinal Homeostasis,"The gut barrier acts as a first line of defense in the body, and plays a vital role in nutrition and immunoregulation. A layer of epithelial cells bound together via intercellular junction proteins maintains intestinal barrier integrity. Based on a tight equilibrium between cell extrusion and cell restitution, the renewal of the epithelium (epithelial turnover) permits the preservation of cell numbers. As the last step within the epithelial turnover, cell shedding occurs due to the pressure of cell division and migration from the base of the crypt. During this process, redistribution of tight junction proteins enables the sealing of the epithelial gap left by the extruded cell, and thereby maintains barrier function. Disturbance in cell shedding can create transient gaps (leaky gut) or cell accumulation in the epithelial layer. In fact, numerous studies have described the association between dysregulated cell shedding and infection, inflammation, and cancer; thus epithelial cell extrusion is considered a key defense mechanism. In the gastrointestinal tract, altered cell shedding has been observed in mouse models of intestinal inflammation and appears as a potential cause of barrier loss in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the relevance of this process, there are many unanswered questions regarding cell shedding. The investigation of those mechanisms controlling cell extrusion in the gut will definitely contribute to our understanding of intestinal homeostasis. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge about intestinal cell shedding under both physiological and pathological circumstances.",-1
Clinical study on Yanghe decoction in improving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy and immune function of breast cancer patients,"Introduction:                    Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) plays an important role in downgrading preoperative tumor size, providing information on regimen activity, and increases treatment efficacy in breast cancer patients. An increasing number of patients have sought Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) during NAC to relieve discomfort, regulate immune function, and improve survival. However, limited evidence is available on how concurrent TCM treatment combined with NAC affects tumor response. This study aims to assess the efficacy of Yanghe decoction, a classical warming Yang formula, on pathological complete response (pCR) and explore its mechanism via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ protein kinase B/nuclear factor kappa-B (PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB) pathway-mediated immune-inflammation microenvironment.              Methods:                    A single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomized control trial (RCT) was designed. This trial aims to recruit 128 participants with breast cancer scheduled to receive NAC in China. All participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to the Neo-Yanghe group (Yanghe decoction plus NAC) or the control group (placebo plus NAC). The primary outcome will be evaluated by the proportion of participants achieving pCR. The secondary outcomes include the expression level of PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB pathway-related proteins, the objective response rate, the time to response, serum level of immune-inflammatory indicators, quality of life, disease-free survival, and overall survival.              Discussion:                    This study will be the first RCT to evaluate the efficacy of Yanghe decoction combined with NAC in treating breast cancer patients, and elucidate the antitumor mechanism via the PI3K/Akt/NF-ÎºB pathway-mediated immune-inflammation microenvironment. If possible, Neo-Yanghe treatment pattern will be a better pharmacological intervention to manage breast cancer than chemotherapy alone. The results of the trial will provide research-based evidence for the development of integrated Chinese and Western medicine guidelines and expert consensus.Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR-INR-2000036943.

The correlation between oxidative stress level and intra-abdominal fat in obese males,"This study aims to investigate the correlation between oxidative stress and intra-abdominal fat (IAF) in obese young and middle-aged males.The present study included 136 male examinees in the Examination Center of the First Hospital of Qinhuangdao from October 10, 2015 to December 10, 2015. Then, clinical data, oxidative stress indices (8-iso-prostaglandin F2Î± [8-iso-PGF2Î±], malondialdehyde [MDA], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]), and IAF area were recorded. All subjects were assigned into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI): obese group (BMI â?28 kg/m, 43 subjects), overweight group (24 â?BMI < 28 kg/m, 46 subjects), and control group (BMI < 24 kg/m, 47 subjects). Then, statistical analysis was performed.There were significant differences in IAF area, leptin, adiponectin, 8-iso-PGF2Î±, MDA, SOD, fasting insulin (FINS), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) among these 3 groups (P < .05). Male subjects in the obese group had higher leptin, 8-iso-PGF2Î±, MDA, FINS, and HOMA-IR levels, compared to subjects in the overweight and control groups. Furthermore, subjects in the overweight group had a larger IAF area and higher 8-iso-PGF2Î±, MDA, and FBG levels, when compared to controls. In addition, SOD was significantly lower in the obese and overweight groups than in the control group. However, there were no statistical differences in age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipids, and islet Î²-cell secretion function (homeostasis model assessment-Î²) among these 3 groups (P â?.05). Moreover, the IAF area was positively correlated to 8-iso-PGF2Î± and MDA, and negatively correlated to SOD.Oxidative stress is significantly associated with the IAF area in obese males, and abdominal obesity could increase oxidative stress level and insulin resistance.",-1
Rifaximin Modulates the Gut Microbiota to Prevent Hepatic Encephalopathy in Liver Cirrhosis Without Impacting the Resistome,"The gut microbiota has an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy(HE). Rifaximin, an intestinal non-absorbable antibacterial agent, is effective in the treatment of HE. However, whether long-term prophylactic use induces antibacterial resistance and its mechanism for treating HE remains unclear. This prospective study assessed the impact of 12 weeks rifaximin administration on the gut microbiota and resistome in cirrhotic patients. Fecal sampling was conducted 1 day before the first rifaximin administration and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 of the study. Thirty cirrhotic patients who were in remission from recurrent HE was enrolled to receive rifaximin (400mg TID for 12 weeks). Rifaximin improved hyperammonemia and cognitive function in the 21 patients who completed rifaximin treatment. The dynamic observations showed the gut microbiota diversity, composition and the number of resistance genes, plasmids, insertion sequences did not change significantly during the period(P>0.05). Metabolic pathways such as aromatic amino acids, tryptophan synthesis, urea cycle, and LPS synthesis reduced. No new antimicrobial resistance genes was emergenced. However, the number of aminoglycosides, rifamycin and phenolic resistance genes increased, whereas tetracycline, fosfomycin and cephamycin decreased (P<0.05). Changes in the abundance of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and B. longum strains correlated with changes of resistance genes. Prophylactic use of rifaximin for 12 weeks improved hyperammonemia and neurophysiological function, maintained gut microbiota diversity, composition and did not change the overall resistome. Rifaximin altered expression of HE-related metabolic pathways. All of these effects could play a key role in preventing HE.

Wide-field mosaics of the corneal subbasal nerve plexus in Parkinson's disease using in vivo confocal microscopy,"In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a non-invasive imaging technique facilitating real-time acquisition of images from the live cornea and its layers with high resolution (1-2 Âµm) and high magnification (600 to 800-fold). IVCM is extensively used to examine the cornea at a cellular level, including the subbasal nerve plexus (SBNP). IVCM of the cornea has thus gained intense interest for probing ophthalmic and systemic diseases affecting peripheral nerves. One of the main drawbacks, however, is the small field of view of IVCM, preventing an overview of SBNP architecture and necessitating subjective image sampling of small areas of the SBNP for analysis. Here, we provide a high-quality dataset of the corneal SBNP reconstructed by automated mosaicking, with an average mosaic image size corresponding to 48 individual IVCM fields of view. The mosaic dataset represents a group of 42 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) with and without concurrent restless leg syndrome. Additionally, mosaics from a control group (n = 13) without PD are also provided, along with clinical data for all included participants.",-1
"Efficacy of broflanilide (VECTRON T500), a new meta-diamide insecticide, for indoor residual spraying against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors","The rotational use of insecticides with different modes of action for indoor residual spraying (IRS) is recommended for improving malaria vector control and managing insecticide resistance. Insecticides with new chemistries are urgently needed. Broflanilide is a newly discovered insecticide under consideration. We investigated the efficacy of a wettable powder (WP) formulation of broflanilide (VECTRON T500) for IRS on mud and cement wall substrates in laboratory and experimental hut studies against pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors in Benin, in comparison with pirimiphos-methyl CS (Actellic 300CS). There was no evidence of cross-resistance to pyrethroids and broflanilide in CDC bottle bioassays. In laboratory cone bioassays, broflanilide WP-treated substrates killed > 80% of susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae sl for 6-14 months. At application rates of 100 mg/m2 and 150 mg/m2, mortality of wild pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae sl entering experimental huts in CovÃ¨, Benin treated with VECTRON T500 was similar to pirimiphos-methyl CS (57-66% vs. 56%, P > 0.05). Throughout the 6-month hut trial, monthly wall cone bioassay mortality on VECTRON T500 treated hut walls remained > 80%. IRS with broflanilide shows potential to significantly improve the control of malaria transmitted by pyrethroid-resistant mosquito vectors and could thus be a crucial addition to the current portfolio of IRS insecticides.",-1
Human Antigen R (HuR) Facilitates miR-19 Synthesis and Affects Cellular Kinetics in Papillary Thyroid Cancer,"Background/aims:                    Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression regulation. Genes are composed of exons that remain in the mature mRNAs and intervening sequences named introns. Splicing is the removal of introns and ligation of exons in a mature transcript. Splice site or spliceosome component mutations can lead to different diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and several cancer types. HuR is an RNA-binding protein that preferentially binds to U- and AU-rich elements, usually found at the 3' UTRs of some mRNAs. We previously observed HuR specifically associated with spliceosomes assembled on introns containing miR-18a and miR-19a. miR-18a and miR-19a are components of the intronic miR-17-92 cluster, along with other five miRNAs. This cluster has been reported to regulate proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in cells. In this context, we reasoned HuR could be controlling the splicing and processing of these miRNAs, leading to altered cellular phenotypes.              Methods:                    We induced HuR overexpression in BCPAP and HEK-293T and analyzed the expression of miRNAs using qPCR, as well as the phenotypic effects in those cells. Cell counting to analyze cell growth was performed after trypan blue staining. Migration and invasion assays were performed using transwell filters and cells were counted after staining with crystal violet. We knocked down HuR using a specific siRNA and analyzed expression of miRNAs by qPCR, as well as cellular kinetics.              Results:                    Our results revealed HuR is associated with miR-19a in BCPAP and HEK-293T cells. Conversely, silencing HuR led to reduced miR-17-5p and miR-19a in BCPAP cells. Our data support that HuR stimulates the expression of miR-19, which is further processed and capable of finding its target sequence in a reporter plasmid. Cells overexpressing HuR showed increased cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion rates. Notably, under the presence of antimiR-19a, BCPAP-HuR cells showed reduced cell growth. Taken together, these results indicate the molecular alterations observed are associated with upregulation of miR-19a, leading to cellular processes involved in cancer development.              Conclusion:                    Our findings propose a connection between HuR, miRNA biogenesis and cellular modifications. HuR stimulates miR-19a and miR-19b expression, which leads to up-regulation of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promoting cancer development.",-1
Host Factors That Control Mosquito-Borne Viral Infections in Humans and Their Vector,"Mosquito-borne viral infections are responsible for a significant degree of morbidity and mortality across the globe due to the severe diseases these infections cause, and they continue to increase each year. These viruses are dependent on the mosquito vector as the primary means of transmission to new vertebrate hosts including avian, livestock, and human populations. Due to the dynamic host environments that mosquito-borne viruses pass through as they are transmitted between vector and vertebrate hosts, there are various host factors that control the response to infection over the course of the pathogen's life cycle. In this review, we discuss these host factors that are present in either vector or vertebrate models during infection, how they vary or are conserved between hosts, and their implications in future research pertaining to disease prevention and treatment.",-1
Long Noncoding RNA SLC20A1-1 Induces Nucleus Pulposus Apoptosis by Sponging miR-146a-5p,"Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a common cause of lower back pain and is characterized by cellular apoptosis, senescence, and extracellular matrix degradation. In the current study, we aimed to identify the effect of the long noncoding RNA SLC20A1-1 on tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±)-induced apoptosis of nuclear pulposus cells (NPCs). Materials and Methods: NPCs were induced by TNF-Î± and used as an in vitro model. The mRNA expression of SLC20A1-1 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) both in clinical samples and in vitro. The scratch assay, Transwell invasion assay, CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry were used to measure cell migration, growth, and apoptosis. The binding site between SLC20A1-1 and miR-146a-5p was assessed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: The expression of SLC20A1-1 was significantly upregulated in herniated lumbar discs, and TNF-Î± induced SLC20A1-1 expression in NPCs. Overexpression of SLC20A1-1 inhibited NPC growth, promoted NPC apoptosis, and enhanced macrophage recruitment and migration. The effect of SLC20A1-1 on NPCs and macrophages could be reversed by etanercept treatment. Moreover, we found that SLC20A1-1 could suppress miR-146a-5p to induce TRAF6 and caspase 3 expression. Conclusion: Overall, SLC20A1-1, an IDD regulator, is involved in TNF-Î±-induced NPC apoptosis by sponging miR-146a-5p. Clinical Trial Registration number: NMU20210325.",-1

"When More is Less: Mosquito Population Suppression Using Sterile, Incompatible and Genetically Modified Male Mosquitoes","The current review of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is motivated by new technologies and the recent renaissance of male release field trials, which is driving an evolution in mosquito control and regulation. Practitioners that are releasing male mosquitoes would do well to learn from past successes and failures, including political and public engagement complications. With examples that include nuanced integrations of the different technologies, e.g., combinations of Wolbachia and irradiation, it is critical that scientists understand and communicate accurately about the technologies, including their evolving management by different regulatory agencies in the USA. Some male release approaches are considered 'pesticides' and regulated by federal and state agencies, while other male release approaches are unregulated. It is important to consider how the new technologies fit with the more 'traditional' chemical applications of adulticides and larvicides. The economics of male release programs are substantially different from traditional control costs, which can be a challenge to their adoption by abatement districts. However, there is substantial need to overcome these complications and challenges, because the problem with invasive mosquitoes grows ever worse with factors that include insecticide resistance, globalization and climate change.",-1
"The ""hyper-triglyceridemic waist phenotype"" is a reliable marker for prediction of accumulation of abdominal visceral fat in Chinese adults","Purpose:                    The ""hyper-triglyceridemic waist (HTW) phenotype"" is relatively convenient to identify, acquired readily, and is inexpensive. We explored the relationship between the HTW phenotype and abdominal-fat accumulation in Chinese adults.              Methods:                    The study cohort comprised 195 adults divided into four groups according to triglyceride (TG) concentration and waist circumference (WC): normal (A), ""hyper-TG"" (B), ""hyper-WC"" (C) and the HTW phenotype (D). The abdominal-fat compartment was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was administered after an overnight fast. Clinical, anthropometric and laboratory data were analyzed.              Results:                    Individuals with the HTW phenotype had the highest WC, Conicity Index, waist:hip ratio and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area, and the highest TG and uric-acid concentrations among the four groups. People with the HTW phenotype were older, had higher blood pressure than those with normal WC (groups A and B). In the OGTT, participants with the HTW phenotype had the highest insulin resistance and lowest insulin sensitivity. In binary logistic regression analysis, age, sex, Body Mass Index, high concentrations of density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and the HTW phenotype were independent risk factors for predicting AVF accumulation with a sensitivity of 81.08% and specificity of 90.91%.              Conclusions:                    Chinese adults with the HTW phenotype had the highest AVF area and insulin resistance, and were associated with higher blood pressure than individuals with normal WC. The HTW phenotype is a reliable marker for prediction of AVF accumulation associated with insulin resistance.              Level of evidence:                    IV.",-1
Feeding practices and association of fasting and low or hypo glycaemia in severe paediatric illnesses in Malawi - a mixed method study,"Background:                    The presence of low or hypo glycaemia in children upon admission to hospital in low income countries is a marker for poor outcome. Fasting during illness may contribute to low blood glucose and caretakers' feeding practices during childhood illnesses may thus play a role in the development of low or hypo glycaemia. This study aims to describe the caretaker's feeding practices and association of fasting with low or hypo glycaemia in sick children in Malawi.              Methods:                    A mixed method approach was used combining quantitative cross-sectional data for children aged 0-17 years admitted to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), a tertiary hospital in Malawi, with qualitative focus group discussions conducted with caretakers of young children who were previously referred to QECH from the five health centres around QECH. Logistic regression was used to analyse the quantitative data and thematic content analysis was conducted for qualitative data analysis.              Results:                    Data for 5131 children who were admitted through the hospital's Paediatric Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) were analysed whereof 2.1% presented with hypoglycaemia (< 2.5 mmol/l) and 6.6% with low glycaemia (â?.5mmoll/l - < 5 mmol/l). Fasting for more than eight hours was associated with low glycaemia as well as hypoglycaemia with Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) of 2.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) of 2.3-3.7) and 4.6, (95% CI 3.0-7.0), respectively. Caretakers demonstrated awareness of the importance of feeding during childhood illness and reported intensified feeding attention to sick children but face feeding challenges when illness becomes severe causing them to seek care at a health facility.              Conclusion:                    Results suggests that caretakers understand the importance of feeding during illness and make efforts to intensify feeding a sick child but challenges occur when illness is severe leading to fasting. Fasting among children admitted to hospitals may serve as a marker of severe illness and determine those at risk of low and hypoglycaemia.",-1
"How Much Do We Know about the Biopsychosocial Predictors of Glycaemic Control? Age and Clinical Factors Predict Glycaemic Control, but Psychological Factors Do Not","Objective:                    Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases in Malaysia. It is associated with significant complications and a high cost of treatment, especially when glycaemic control is poor. Despite its negative impact on health, data is still lacking on the possible biopsychosocial predictors of poor glycaemic control among the diabetic population. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence of poor glycaemic control as well as its association with biopsychosocial factors such as personality traits, psychiatric factors, and quality of life (QOL) among Malaysian patients with diabetes.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) using outpatient population diabetic patients. Demographic data on social and clinical characteristics were collected from participants. Several questionnaires were administered, including the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to measure depressive symptoms, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess anxiety symptoms, the Big Five Inventory (BFI) to evaluate personality traits, and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) to assess QOL. Multivariate binary logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors of poor glycaemic control.              Results:                    300 patients with diabetes mellitus were recruited, with the majority (90%) having type 2 diabetes. In this population, the prevalence of poor glycaemic control (HbA1C â?7.0%) was 69%, with a median HbA1C of 7.6% (IQR = 2.7). Longer duration of diabetes mellitus and a greater number of days of missed medications predicted poor glycaemic control, while older age and overall self-perception of QOL protected against poor glycaemic control. No psychological factors were associated with poor glycaemic control.              Conclusion:                    This study emphasizes the importance of considering the various factors that contribute to poor glycaemic control, such as duration of diabetes, medication adherence, age, and QOL. These findings should be used by clinicians, particularly when planning a multidisciplinary approach to the management of diabetes.",-1
First report of N1575Y mutation in Anopheles gambiae in Sierra Leone,"The resistance of mosquito vectors to insecticides is one of the biological obstacles in the fight against malaria. Understanding of the status and mechanisms underlying the insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae species is necessary for success of vector control efforts. The study aimed to determine the molecular forms of An. gambiae from four districts in Sierra Leone during May and June 2018, and the level of N1575Y mutation. The molecular form identification of adult female An. gambiae mosquitoes reared from larvae were carried out using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. And the N1575Y mutations were detected using SNaPshot and sequencing. As a result, significant differences were found in the distribution of An. gambiae molecular forms among regions (P < 0.001). And a total of 638 An. gambiae sensu stricto, 106 An. coluzzi, and 4 hybrid individuals were identified. Moreover, the overall N1575Y mutation frequency was 10.2% with no statistical difference among regions (Ï2 = 3.009, P = 0.390). In addition, no significant differences in N1575Y mutation frequency were found among different An. gambiae molecular forms (P = 0.383). In conclusion, the N1575Y mutation in An. gambiae populations in Sierra Leone was reported for the first time in the present study. It provides key evidence for the necessity of monitoring vector susceptibility levels to insecticides used in this country.",-1
Senhance robot-assisted adrenalectomy: a case series,"We present a case series of 12 consecutive robot-assisted adrenalectomies performed from May 2019 to March 2020 by a single surgeon experienced in laparoscopy using the novel Senhance robotic system.

The E6 Oncoprotein of HPV16 AA-c Variant Regulates Cell Migration through the MINCR/miR-28-5p/RAP1B Axis,"The E6 oncoprotein of HPV16 variants differentially alters the transcription of the genes involved in migration and non-coding RNAs such as lncRNAs. The role of the lncRNA MINCR in cervical cancer and its relationship with variants of oncogenic HPV remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of the E6 oncoprotein of the AA-c variant of HPV16 in cell migration through the MINCR/miR-28-5p/RAP1B axis. To explore the functional role of MINCR in CC, we used an in vitro model of C33-A cells with exogenous expression of the E6 oncoprotein of the AA-c variant of HPV16. Interfering RNAs performed MINCR silencing, and the expression of miR-28-5p and RAP1B mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR. We found that C33-A/AA-c cells expressed MINCR 8-fold higher compared to the control cells. There is an inverse correlation between the expression of miR-28-5p and RAP1B in C33-A/AA-c cells. Our results suggest that MINCR might regulate the expression of RAP1B through the inhibition of miR-28-5p in CC cells expressing the E6 oncoprotein of HPV16 AA-c. We report, for the first time, that the MINCR/miR-28-5p/RAP1B axis positively regulates cell migration in CC-derived cells that express the E6 oncoprotein of the AA-c variant of HPV16.",-1
An Improved Multitask Learning Model with Matching Network and Its Application in Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Recommendation,"Multitask learning (MTL) is an open and challenging problem in various real-world applications, such as recommendation systems, natural language processing, and computer vision. The typical way of conducting multitask learning is establishing some global parameter sharing mechanism among all tasks or assigning each task an individual set of parameters with cross-connections between tasks. However, for most existing approaches, the raw features are abstracted step by step, semantic information is mined from input space, and matching relation features are not introduced into the model. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel MMOE-match network to model the matches between medical cases and syndrome elements and introduce the recommendation algorithm into traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) study. Accurate medical record recommendation is significant for intelligent medical treatment. Ranking algorithms can be introduced in multi-TCM scenarios, such as syndrome element recommendation, symptom recommendation, and drug prescription recommendation. The recommendation system includes two main stages: recalling and ranking. The core of recalling and ranking is a two-tower matching network and multitask learning. MMOE-match combines the advantages of recalling and ranking model to design a new network. Furtherly, we try to take the matching network output as the input of multitask learning and compare the matching features designed by the manual. The data show that our model can bring significant positive benefits.",-1
The beneficial effects of Mediterranean diet over low-fat diet may be mediated by decreasing hepatic fat content,"Background & aim:                    It is unclear if a reduction in hepatic fat content (HFC) is a major mediator of the cardiometabolic benefit of lifestyle intervention, and whether it has prognostic significance beyond the loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT). In the present sub-study, we hypothesized that HFC loss in response to dietary interventions induces specific beneficial effects independently of VAT changes.              Methods:                    In an 18-month weight-loss trial, 278 participants with abdominal obesity/dyslipidemia were randomized to low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC + 28 g walnuts/day) diets with/without moderate physical activity. HFC and abdominal fat-depots were measured using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, after 6 (sub-study, n = 158) and 18 months.              Results:                    Of 278 participants (mean HFC 10.2% [range: 0.01%-50.4%]), the retention rate was 86.3%. The %HFC substantially decreased after 6 months (-6.6% absolute units [-41% relatively]) and 18 months (-4.0% absolute units [-29% relatively]; p <0.001 vs. baseline). Reductions of HFC were associated with decreases in VAT beyond weight loss. After controlling for VAT loss, decreased %HFC remained independently associated with reductions in serum gamma glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase, circulating chemerin, and glycated hemoglobin (p <0.05). While the reduction in HFC was similar between physical activity groups, MED/LC induced a greater %HFC decrease (p = 0.036) and greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk parameters (p <0.05) than the LF diet, even after controlling for VAT changes. Yet, the greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk parameters induced by MED/LC were all markedly attenuated when controlling for HFC changes.              Conclusions:                    %HFC is substantially reduced by diet-induced moderate weight loss and is more effectively reduced by the MED/LC diet than the LF diet, independently of VAT changes. The beneficial effects of the MED/LC diet on specific cardiometabolic parameters appear to be mediated more by decreases in %HFC than VAT loss.              Lay summary:                    High hepatic fat content is associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. In the CENTRAL 18-month intervention trial, a Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate diet induced a greater decrease in hepatic fat content than a low-fat diet, conferring beneficial health effects that were beyond the favorable effects of visceral fat loss.

Effectiveness of medical nutrition therapy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a systematic review,"Background:                    Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) has an integral role in overall diabetes management. During adolescence, consideration of physiological and psychosocial changes is essential for implementing an optimal diabetes treatment.              Objectives:                    Our aim was to identify, summarize, and interpret the published literature about MNT in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.              Methods:                    The Medline (PubMed) and EMBASE databases were searched from January 1959 to December 2021. The inclusion criteria were interventional studies with MNT in adolescents with type 1 diabetes with a disease duration over 1 year, including the following outcomes: dietary intake and daily eating patterns (assessed with validated tools, two or more 24 h dietary recall or 3-day dietary records), the diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES), glycemic control, lipid profile and body mass index (BMI). The exclusion criteria were studies without a control group (except for pre-post studies), the lack of randomization and those studies that assessed only a single nutrient, food or meal consumption, as well as reviews, and in-vitro/in-vivo studies. The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. A narrative synthesis was performed to present the results. The quality of evidence was assessed with the GRADE guidance.              Results:                    From a total of 5377 records, 12 intervention studies (9 RCT and 3 pre-post intervention studies) were included. The data were assessed in order to perform a meta-analysis; however, the studies were too heterogeneous. The studies showed conflicting results about the effectiveness of MNT on dietary pattern, DSMES, glycemic control, lipid profile and BMI.              Conclusions:                    Clinical research studies on the effectiveness of MNT in adolescents with type 1 diabetes are scarce. The limited number of studies with a high risk of bias precludes establishing robust conclusions on this issue. Further research is warranted.",-1
miR-374a-5p regulates inflammatory genes and monocyte function in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,"MicroRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression controlling cellular processes including inflammation. We explored their role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and identified reduced expression of miR-374a-5p in IBD monocytes that correlated with a module of up-regulated genes related to the inflammatory response. Key proinflammatory module genes, including for example TNFÎ±, IL1A, IL6, and OSM, were inversely correlated with miR-374a-5p and were validated in vitro. In colonic biopsies, miR-374a-5p was again reduced in expression and inversely correlated with the same inflammatory module, and its levels predicted subsequent response to anti-TNF therapy. Increased miR-374a-5p expression was shown to control macrophage-driven inflammation by suppressing proinflammatory mediators and to reduce the capacity of monocytes to migrate and activate T cells. Our findings suggest that miR-374a-5p reduction is a central driver of inflammation in IBD, and its therapeutic supplementation could reduce monocyte-driven inflammation in IBD or other immune-mediated diseases.",-1
NEAR: Named entity and attribute recognition of clinical concepts,"Named Entity Recognition (NER) or the extraction of concepts from clinical text is the task of identifying entities in text and slotting them into categories such as problems, treatments, tests, clinical departments, occurrences (such as admission and discharge) and others. NER forms a critical component of processing and leveraging unstructured data from Electronic Health Records (EHR). While identifying the spans and categories of concepts is itself a challenging task, these entities could also have attributes such as negation that pivot their meanings implied to the consumers of the named entities. There has been little research dedicated to identifying the entities and their qualifying attributes together. This research hopes to contribute to the area of detecting entities and their corresponding attributes by modelling the NER task as a supervised, multi-label tagging problem with each of the attributes assigned tagging sequence labels. In this paper, we propose 3 architectures to achieve this multi-label entity tagging: BiLSTM n-CRF, BiLSTM-CRF-Smax-TF and BiLSTM n-CRF-TF. We evaluate these methods on the 2010 i2b2/VA and the i2b2 2012 shared task datasets. Our different models obtain best NER scores of 0.903 and 0.808 on the i2b2 2010/VA and i2b2 2012 respectively. The highest span based micro-averaged F1 polarity scores obtained were 0.832 and 0.836 on the i2b2 2010/VA and i2b2 2012 datasets respectively, and the highest macro-averaged F1 polarity scores obtained were 0.924 and 0.888 respectively. The modality studies conducted on i2b2 2012 dataset revealed high scores of 0.818 and 0.501 for span based micro-averaged F1 and macro-averaged F1 respectively.",-1
LncRNA SNHG11 enhances bevacizumab resistance in colorectal cancer by mediating miR-1207-5p/ABCC1 axis,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to serve as vital regulators in the chemoresistance of human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we aimed to explore the functions of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 11 (SNHG11) in the resistance of CRC to bevacizumab. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot assay or immunohistochemistry assay were performed to examine the expression of SNHG11, microRNA-1207-5p (miR-1207-5p), ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1) and Ki67. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was conducted to evaluate bevacizumab resistance and cell viability. 5'-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine analysis, flow cytometry analysis and wound-healing assay were conducted for cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were employed to analyze the relations among SNHG11, miR-1207-5p and ABCC1. Murine xenograft model assay was employed to analyze bevacizumab resistance in vivo. The exosomes were observed under transmission electron microscopy. SNHG11 was overexpressed in bevacizumab-resistant CRC tissues and cells. Knockdown of SNHG11 restrained bevacizumab resistance, repressed cell proliferation and migration, and promoted apoptosis in bevacizumab-resistant CRC cells. MiR-1207-5p served as the target of SNHG11 and SNHG11 regulated bevacizumab resistance by targeting miR-1207-5p. ABCC1 was the target gene of miR-1207-5p. Overexpression of miR-1207-5p inhibited bevacizumab resistance and cell progression in bevacizumab-resistant CRC cells, with ABCC1 elevation abrogated the impacts. SNHG11 silencing repressed bevacizumab resistance in vivo. In addition, exosomal SNHG11 was upregulated in bevacizumab-resistant CRC cells. SNHG11 contributes to bevacizumab resistance in CRC depending on the modulation of miR-1207-5p and ABCC1.",-1
"The Inhibitory Effects of New Zealand Pine Bark (Enzogenol Â®) on Î±-Amylase, Î±-Glucosidase, and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Enzymes","The New Zealand pine bark extract (EnzogenolÂ®) has previously been shown to elicit acute hypoglycaemic effects in humans. The present study investigated the underlying mechanisms of EnzogenolÂ® in reducing postprandial glucose in humans. The potential inhibitory action of EnzogenolÂ® against digestive enzymes: Î±-amylase and Î±-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme was determined. EnzogenolÂ® demonstrated the ability to inhibit all three enzymes: Î±-amylase enzyme activity (IC50 3.98 Â± 0.11 mg/mL), Î±-glucosidase enzyme activity (IC50 13.02 Â± 0.28 Î¼g/mL), and DPP-4 enzyme activity (IC50 2.51 Â± 0.04 mg/mL). The present findings indicate the potential for EnzogenolÂ® to improve postprandial glycaemia by delaying carbohydrate digestion via the inhibition of digestive enzymes (Î±-amylase and Î±-glucosidase), and enhancing the incretin effect via inhibiting the dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 enzyme. The inhibitory actions of EnzogenolÂ® on enzymes should therefore be further validated in humans for its potential use in type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention and management.",-1
Monitoring Approaches for a Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease Machine Learning Model,"Objective:                    The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of three metrics to monitor for a reduction in performance of a chronic kidney disease (CKD) model deployed at a pediatric hospital.              Methods:                    The CKD risk model estimates a patient's risk of developing CKD 3 to 12 months following an inpatient admission. The model was developed on a retrospective dataset of 4,879 admissions from 2014 to 2018, then run silently on 1,270 admissions from April to October, 2019. Three metrics were used to monitor its performance during the silent phase: (1) standardized mean differences (SMDs); (2) performance of a ""membership model""; and (3) response distribution analysis. Observed patient outcomes for the 1,270 admissions were used to calculate prospective model performance and the ability of the three metrics to detect performance changes.              Results:                    The deployed model had an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC) of 0.63 in the prospective evaluation, which was a significant decrease from an AUROC of 0.76 on retrospective data (p = 0.033). Among the three metrics, SMDs were significantly different for 66/75 (88%) of the model's input variables (p <0.05) between retrospective and deployment data. The membership model was able to discriminate between the two settings (AUROC = 0.71, p <0.0001) and the response distributions were significantly different (p <0.0001) for the two settings.              Conclusion:                    This study suggests that the three metrics examined could provide early indication of performance deterioration in deployed models' performance.",-1
Validity of the modified sphygmomanometer test for the assessment of tip pinch strength in Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    The tip pinch is one of the most delicate and precise movement of the hand, and it is used to manipulate small objects, commonly observed in the activities of daily living of any individuals. Individuals with Parkinson Disease (PD) with impaired manual dexterity, manipulative skills, and hand weakness have an important barrier for activities of daily life. However, the dynamometer usually used for measuring the tip pinch have a high cost, so, validate a sphygmomanometer can make this assessment more accessible.              Objective:                    To investigate the validity of the modified sphygmomanometer test in the evaluation of tip pinch strength when compared to the gold standard.              Methods:                    50 individuals with idiopathic PD took part in the study. The muscle strength of tip pinch on the dominant and non-dominant side was measured by the modified sphygmomanometer test and the gold standard, the dynamometer. Concurrent validity was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.              Results:                    50 individuals diagnosed with idiopathic PD, mean age of 67 Â± 8.0 years, 68% male, mean time of diagnosis in months of 84 Â± 66 and Hoehn and Yahr mean of 2.5 Â± 0.6. There was a significant correlation of moderate magnitude between the modified sphygmomanometer test and the dynamometer in dominant side (r = 0.44; p < 0.01) and non-dominant side (r = 0.48; p < 0.01).              Conclusion:                    The modified sphygmomanometer test showed adequate validity for assessing the muscle strength of the tip pinch in individuals with PD.",-1
Research on Multicamera Photography Image Art in BERT Motion Based on Deep Learning Mode,"In order to improve the artistic expression effect of photographic images, this article combines the deep learning model to conduct multicamera photographic image art research in BERT motion. Moreover, this article analyzes the external parameter errors caused in the calibration process and uses the checkerboard in the common field of view to calibrate the spatial coordinates of the corners of the board in multiple camera coordinate systems.

Effects of abdominal visceral fat compared with those of subcutaneous fat on the association between PM 10 and hypertension in Korean men: A cross-sectional study,"We assessed whether visceral adipose tissue (VAT) compared with subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) has modifying effects on the cross-sectional association between ambient air pollution and hypertension in Korean men. This study included 1,417 adult men who visited a health checkup center. Abdominal fat depots were measured by computed tomography, and we used the annual average concentrations of ambient air pollutants such as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of â?0 Î¼m (PM10), nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide (CO). The annual mean concentrations of PM10 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-1.52) and CO (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.03-1.39) showed a positive association with hypertension. In particular, modifying effects on hypertension were found between PM10 and VAT-related traits such as VAT and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VSR). The association between PM10 and hypertension was much stronger in the high-VAT (OR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.12-2.71) and high-VSR groups (OR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.23-1.91). However, the strength of association across levels of SAT was not observed (Pint = 0.4615). In conclusion, we found that association between PM10 exposure and hypertension is different by abdominal fat distribution.",-1
"Hsa_circ_0001017 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma by sponging miR-145-5p","Background:                    Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have displayed important roles in the development and progression of various cancers. However, the functions of the majority of circRNAs in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unknown.              Methods:                    Circular RNA microarray analysis was performed in three OS cell lines (Saos-2, U2OS and MG63) and normal vascular endothelial cells. The co-differentially expressed circRNAs (CDECs) were identified in OS cell lines with the criterion of FDR (false discovery rate) < 0.05 and |fold change (FC)|> 2. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate the expression levels of selected CDECs. A series of functional assays, including MTT assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay were conducted in OS cells. The interaction between circRNA and miRNAs was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay.              Results:                    A total of 241 CDECs, including 75 upregulated and 166 downregulated CDECs, were identified in three OS cell lines compared with normal vascular endothelial cells. PCR validation showed that hsa_circ_0000704, hsa_circ_0001017 and hsa_circ_0005035 were all highly expression in the three OS cell lines, compared with osteoblast cell lines (HECC, hFOB1.19 and HFF-1). Functionally, overexpression of circ_0001017 significantly promoted the cell proliferation, migration and invasion and decreased apoptosis in U2OS cells. Knockdown of circ_0001017 obtained the opposite results. Circ_0001017 may downregulate miR-145-5p through direct binding. Furthermore, the expression of miR-145-5p was negatively regulated by circ_0001017 in OS cells. In addition, further functional studies indicated that miR-145-5p inhibitor eliminated the effects caused by si-circ_0001017 in OS cells.              Conclusions:                    In conclusion, our study suggested that circ_0001017 may be a novel oncogenic factor during the progression and development of OS by targeting miR-145-5p.",-1
The effect of zinc supplementation on glucose homeostasis: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial,"Aims:                    The burden and health costs of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus continue to increase globally and prevention strategies in at-risk people need to be explored. Previous work, in both animal models and humans, supports the role of zinc in improving glucose homeostasis. We, therefore, aimed to test the effectiveness of zinc supplementation on glycaemic control in pre-diabetic adults.              Methods:                    We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across 10 General Practitioner (GP) practices in NSW, Australia. The trial is known as Zinc in Preventing the Progression of pre-Diabetes (ZIPPeD)Study. Pre-diabetic (haemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 5.7-6.4%, 39-46 mmol/mol) men and women (N = 98) were all assigned to a free state government telephone health coaching service (New South Wales Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service) and then randomised to either daily 30 mg zinc gluconate or placebo. Blood tests were collected at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months for the primary outcomes (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose (FBG)); secondary outcomes included Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA 2) parameters, lipids, body weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse.              Results:                    The baseline-adjusted mean group difference at 6 months, expressed as treatment-placebo, (95% CI) was -0.02 (-0.14, 0.11, p = 0.78) for HbA1c and 0.17 (-0.07, 0.42; p = 0.17) for FBG, neither of which were statistically significant. There were also no significant differences between groups in any of the secondary outcomes. Zinc was well tolerated, and compliance was high (88%).              Conclusion:                    We believe our results are consistent with other Western clinical trial studies and do not support the use of supplemental zinc in populations with a Western diet. There may still be a role for supplemental zinc in the developing world where diets may be zinc deficient.

Psychological factors and maternal-fetal attachment in relation to epidural choice,"Introduction:                    A woman's first childbirth is an event of great importance to her life, involving her transition to parenthood. Many studies have analyzed the roles of depression, anxiety and fear of childbirth linked to childbirth expectations and the consequent choice of an epidural to avoid pain. Few studies have investigated the predictor role of maternal-fetal attachment on the choice of epidural.              Objective:                    Explore, in a sample of low-risk pregnant nulliparous women, differences regarding the preference, or not, of epidural for vaginal childbirth.              Design and setting:                    87 nulliparous women, aged 24 to 44 years of age, were recruited in the maternity ward of a public hospital of the metropolitan area of Tuscany (Italy) during the 3rd trimester of gestation. Participants were asked to complete the Pregnancy Related Anxiety Questionnaire-R, Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire, Centrality of Events Scale, and Prenatal Attachment Inventory.              Findings:                    Multivariate analyses of variance showed that women who chose delivery without epidural reported lower levels of fear of childbirth and anxiety, and higher levels of centrality of pregnancy and prenatal attachment to unborn child, than women who chose epidural.              Key conclusions:                    Our data highlight the importance that medical staff focus on the maternal bond, to help future mothers have the best possible childbirth experience.",-1
"The Effect of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Combined with Visual Cueing Training on Motor Function, Balance, and Gait Ability of Patients with Parkinson's Disease","Background and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on motor function, balance and gait ability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Materials and Methods: For the experiment, 30 patients with PD were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 15) and the control group (n = 15). Visual cueing training was commonly applied to both groups, the experimental group applied tDCS simultaneously with visual training, and the control group applied sham tDCS simultaneously with visual training. All subjects were pre-tested before the first intervention, post-tested after completing all 4 weeks of intervention, and followed-up tested 2 weeks after the completing intervention. The tests used the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for motor function assessment, Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) for balance assessment, Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q) and the GAITRite system for gait ability assessment. Among the data obtained through the GAITRite system, gait velocity, cadence, step time, double support time, and stride length were analyzed. Results: The experimental group showed a significant decrease in UPDRS and a significant increase in FGA and cadence after the intervention. In addition, UPDRS and cadence showed a significant difference in the follow-up test compared to the pre-intervention test. Conclusions: This study suggests that the application of tDCS to the supplementary motor area of PD patients is useful as an adjuvant therapy for rehabilitation training of PD patients.",-1
Commensal oral microbiota induces osteoimmunomodulatory effects separate from systemic microbiome in mice,"Commensal microbes critically regulate skeletal homeostasis, yet the impact of specific microbiota communities on osteoimmune response mechanisms is unknown. To discern osteoimmunomodulatory effects imparted by the commensal oral microbiota that are distinct from the systemic microbiota, osteoimmunology studies were performed in both alveolar bone and nonoral skeletal sites of specific pathogen-free (SPF) versus germ-free (GF) mice and SPF mice subjected to saline versus chlorhexidine oral rinses. SPF versus GF mice had reduced cortical/trabecular bone and an enhanced pro-osteoclastic phenotype in alveolar bone. TLR signaling and Th17 cells that have known pro-osteoclastic actions were increased in alveolar BM, but not long BM, of SPF versus GF mice. MHC II antigen presentation genes and activated DCs and CD4+ T cells were elevated in alveolar BM, but not long BM, of SPF versus GF mice. These findings were substantiated by in vitro allostimulation studies demonstrating increased activated DCs derived from alveolar BM, but not long BM, of SPF versus GF mice. Chlorhexidine antiseptic rinse depleted the oral, but not gut, bacteriome in SPF mice. Findings from saline- versus chlorhexidine-treated SPF mice corroborated outcomes from SPF versus GF mice, which reveals that the commensal oral microbiota imparts osteoimmunomodulatory effects separate from the systemic microbiome.",-1
Research Progress of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Intelligent Diagnosis of the Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease,"The coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is a common cardiovascular disease with high morbidity, disability, and societal burden. Early, precise, and comprehensive diagnosis of the coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is of great significance. The rise of artificial intelligence technologies, represented by machine learning and deep learning, provides new methods to address the above issues. In recent years, artificial intelligence has achieved an extraordinary progress in multiple aspects of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease diagnosis, including the construction of intelligent diagnostic models based on artificial intelligence algorithms, applications of artificial intelligence algorithms in coronary angiography, coronary CT angiography, intravascular imaging, cardiac magnetic resonance, and functional parameters. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the technical background and current state of research on the application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of the coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and analyzes recent challenges and perspectives in this field.",-1
Increased Cytokine Levels Assist in the Diagnosis of Respiratory Bacterial Infections or Concurrent Bacteremia in Patients With Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a form of tumor that originates in the lymphoid tissues. Bacterial infections are very common in NHL patients. Because most of the patients do not experience apparent symptoms during the initial stage of infection, it is difficult to detect the underlying condition before it progresses to a more critical level. The activation of the cytokines is a hallmark of inflammation. Due to the advantages of short detection time and high sensitivity of cytokines, many studies have focused on relationship between cytokines and infection. However, few studies have been conducted on NHL patients with infection. Therefore, we reviewed the cytokine profiles of 229 newly diagnosed NHL patients and 40 healthy adults to predict respiratory bacterial infection and bacteremia. Our findings revealed that IL-6(41.67 vs 9.50 pg/mL), IL-8(15.55 vs 6.61 pg/mL), IL-10(8.02 vs 4.52 pg/mL),TNF-Î²(3.82 vs 2.96 pg/mL), IFN- Î³(4.76 vs 2.96 pg/mL), body temperature(37.6 vs 36.5Â°C), CRP(20.80 vs 4.37 mg/L), and PCT(0.10 vs 0.04 ng/mL) levels were considerably greater in NHL cases with respiratory bacterial infections relative to NHL cases without infection (P<0.05). Furthermore, IL-6(145.00 vs 41.67 pg/mL), IL-8(34.60 vs 15.55 pg/mL),temperature(38.4 vs 37.6Â°C), PCT(0.79 vs 0.10 ng/mL), and CRP(93.70 vs 20.80 mg/L) levels in respiratory infectious NHL patients with more severe bacteremia were considerably elevated than in patients with respiratory bacterial infections only (P<0.05). Remarkably, increased levels of IL-6 and IL-8 are effective in determining whether or not pulmonary bacterial infectious NHL patients have bacteremia. Temperature, PCT, and CRP all have lower sensitivity and specificity than IL-6. IL-6 â?8.79pg/mL indicates the presence of pulmonary bacterial infection in newly diagnosed NHL patients, and IL-6 â?02.6pg/mL may suggest pulmonary bacterial infection with bacteremia. In short, this study shows that cytokines can be advantageous in the diagnosis and differentiation of pulmonary bacterial infection and bacteremia in newly diagnosed NHL patients and may also guide for the use of clinical antibiotics.",-1
Membrane protective role of autophagic machinery during infection of epithelial cells by Candida albicans,"Candida albicans (C. albicans) is an opportunistic pathogen causing infections ranging from superficial to life-threatening disseminated infections. In a susceptible host, C. albicans is able to translocate through the gut barrier, promoting its dissemination into deeper organs. C. albicans hyphae can invade human epithelial cells by two well-documented mechanisms: epithelial-driven endocytosis and C. albicans-driven active penetration. One mechanism by which host cells protect themselves against intracellular C. albicans is termed autophagy. The protective role of autophagy during C. albicans infection has been investigated in myeloid cells; however, far less is known regarding the role of this process during the infection of epithelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy-related proteins during the infection of epithelial cells, including intestinal epithelial cells and gut explants, by C. albicans. Using cell imaging, we show that key molecular players of the autophagy machinery (LC3-II, PI3P, ATG16L1, and WIPI2) were recruited at Candida invasion sites. We deepened these observations by electron microscopy analyses that reveal the presence of autophagosomes in the vicinity of invading hyphae. Importantly, these events occur during active penetration of C. albicans into host cells and are associated with plasma membrane damage. In this context, we show that the autophagy-related key proteins ATG5 and ATG16L1 contribute to plasma membrane repair mediated by lysosomal exocytosis and participate in protecting epithelial cells against C. albicans-induced cell death. Our findings provide a novel mechanism by which epithelial cells, forming the first line of defense against C. albicans in the gut, can react to limit C. albicans invasion.",-1
"The worldwide seroprevalence of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background:                    As the three major arthropod-borne viruses, dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and zika virus (ZIKV) are posing a growing threat to global public health and socioeconomic development. Our study aimed to systematically review the global seroprevalences of these arboviruses from existing publications.              Methods:                    Articles published between Jan 01, 2000 and Dec 31, 2019 in the databases of Embase, Pubmed and Web of Science were searched and collected. Countries or areas with known local presence of Aedes vector mosquitoes were included. Random effects model was utilized to estimate the pooled seroprevalences and the proportion of inapparent infection.              Results:                    Out of 1375, a total of 133 articles involving 176,001 subjects were included for our analysis. The pooled seroprevalences of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV were 38%, 25% and 18%, respectively; and their corresponding proportions of inapparent infections were 80%, 40% and 50%. The South-East Asia Region had the highest seroprevalences of DENV and CHIKV, while the Region of the Americas had the highest seroprevalence of ZIKV. The seroprevalences of DENV and CHIKV were similar when comparing developed and developing countries, urban and rural areas, or among different populations. In addition, we observed a decreased global seroprevalences in the new decade (2010-2019) comparing to the decade before (2000-2009) for CHIKV. For ZIKV, the positive rates tested with the nucleic acid detection method were lower than those tested with the antibody detection method. Lastly, numerous cases of dual seropositivity for CHIKV and DENV were reported.              Conclusions:                    Our results revealed a varied prevalence of arbovirus infections in different geographical regions and countries, and the inapparent infection accounted an unneglected portion of infections that requires more attention. This study will shed lights on our understanding of the true burden of arbovirus infections and promote appropriate vaccination in the future.",-1
Lifestyle factors and visceral adipose tissue: Results from the PREDIMED-PLUS study,"Background:                    Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a strong predictor of cardiometabolic health, and lifestyle factors may have a positive influence on VAT depot. This study aimed to assess the cross-sectional associations between baseline levels of physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviours (SB) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with VAT depot in older individuals with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome.              Methods:                    Baseline data of the PREDIMED-Plus study including a sample of 1,231 Caucasian men and women aged 55-75 years were used. Levels of leisure-time PA (total, light, and moderate-to-vigorous, in METsÂ·min/day) and SB (total and TV-viewing, in h/day) were evaluated using validated questionnaires. Adherence to the MedDiet was evaluated using a 17-item energy-restricted MedDiet (erMedDiet) screener. The chair-stand test was used to estimate the muscle strength. VAT depot was assessed with DXA-CoreScan. Multivariable adjusted linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between lifestyle factors and VAT. For the statistics we had used multiadjusted linear regression models.              Results:                    Total leisure-time PA (100 METsÂ·min/day: Î² -24.3g, -36.7;-11.9g), moderate-to-vigorous PA (Î² -27.8g, 95% CI -40.8;-14.8g), chair-stand test (repeat: Î² -11.5g, 95% CI -20.1;-2.93g) were inversely associated, and total SB (h/day: Î² 38.2g, 95% CI 14.7;61.7) positively associated with VAT. Light PA, TV-viewing time and adherence to an erMedDiet were not significantly associated with VAT.              Conclusions:                    In older adults with overweigh/obesity and metabolic syndrome, greater PA, muscle strength, and lower total SB were associated with less VAT depot. In this study, adherence to an erMedDiet was not associated with lower VAT.",-1
"The influence of orlistat, metformin and diet on serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 in obeses women with and without insulin resistance","A range of studies showed confusing data about the relationship between obesity, weight reduction and circulating total insulin-like growth factor -1 (IGF-1). The aim of the study was to compare the influence of orlistat (IO), metformin (IM), or calorie-restricted diet (LC) on IGF-1, with special respect to insulin-resistance status. One hundred and fourteen obese women aged from 18 to 40 years were divided into insulin sensitive (IS) and insulin resistant (IR) groups and received a low calorie diet (LC), or an isocaloric diet and 500 mg metformin twice daily (IM), or isocaloric diet with 120 mg orlistat three times daily (IO). Before and after the intervention anthropometric parameters, serum lipid profile, serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, insulin, glucose, IGF-1, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment), and visceral adiposity index (VAI), and their changes were registered. Although the reductions in weight and body fat were comparable in IS and IR groups, only women with IR showed a significant increase in IGF-1 concentration as a result of all interventions. We found significant positive correlations of ÎIGF-1 with initial and Î values of: HOMA-IR, triglyceride/high-density cholesterol ratio, VAI. IR premenopausal women show significant increase in IGF-1 serum concentrations regardless the method of intervention. The increase in IGF-1 was parallel to the improvement of insulin resistance parameters.",-1
The Role of Epigenetic Modifications in Late Complications in Type 1 Diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the destruction of pancreatic Î² cells leads to hyperglycemia. The prevention of hyperglycemia is very important to avoid or at least postpone the development of micro- and macrovascular complications, also known as late complications. These include diabetic retinopathy, chronic renal failure, diabetic neuropathy, and cardiovascular diseases. The impact of long-term hyperglycemia has been shown to persist long after the normalization of blood glucose levels, a phenomenon known as metabolic memory. It is believed that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, play an important role in metabolic memory. The aim of this review is to address the impact of long-term hyperglycemia on epigenetic marks in late complications of type 1 diabetes.",-1
"Household knowledge, perceptions and practices of mosquito larval source management for malaria prevention and control in Mwanza district, Malawi: a cross-sectional study","Background:                    Mosquito larval source management (LSM) is a key outdoor malaria vector control strategy in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Knowledge of this strategy is important for optimal design and implementation of effective malaria control interventions in this region. This study assessed household knowledge, perceptions and practices of mosquito LSM methods (draining stagnant water, larviciding, clearing grass/bushes and clean environment).              Methods:                    A cross-sectional design was used whereby 479 households were selected using two-stage sampling in Mwanza district, Malawi. A household questionnaire was administered to an adult member of the house. Respondents were asked questions on knowledge, perceptions and practices of mosquito LSM methods. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with high-level knowledge of mosquito LSM methods.              Results:                    Majority of the respondents (64.5%) had high-level knowledge of mosquito LSM methods. Specifically, 63.7% (200/314) had positive perceptions about draining stagnant water, whereas 95.3% (223/234) practiced clean environment for malaria control and 5.2% had knowledge about larviciding. Compared to respondents with primary education, those with secondary education were more likely, whereas those without education were less likely, to have high-level knowledge of mosquito LSM methods (AOR = 3.54, 95% CI 1.45-8.63 and AOR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.64, respectively). Compared to respondents engaged in crop farming, those engaged in mixed farming (including pastoralists) and the self-employed (including business persons) were more likely to have high-level knowledge of mosquito LSM methods (AOR = 6.95, 95% CI 3.39-14.23 and AOR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.47-8.86, respectively). Respondents living in mud-walled households were less likely to have high-knowledge of mosquito LSM methods than those living in brick-walled households (AOR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.86).              Conclusions:                    A high-level knowledge of mosquito LSM methods was established. However, when designing and implementing this strategy, specific attention should be paid to the uneducated, crop farmers and those living in poor households.",-1
Changes in the stool and oropharyngeal microbiome in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Although the etiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is largely unknown, it is accepted that OCD is a complex disorder. There is a known bi-directional interaction between the gut microbiome and brain activity. Several authors have reported associations between changes in gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression or autism. Furthermore, a pediatric-onset neuropsychiatric OCD-related syndrome occurs after streptococcal infection, which might indicate that exposure to certain microbes could be involved in OCD susceptibility. However, only one study has investigated the microbiome of OCD patients to date. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based metagenomic sequencing to analyze the stool and oropharyngeal microbiome composition of 32 OCD cases and 32 age and gender matched controls. We estimated different Î±- and Î²-diversity measures and performed LEfSe and Wilcoxon tests to assess differences in bacterial distribution. OCD stool samples showed a trend towards lower bacterial Î±-diversity, as well as an increase of the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae, particularly of the genus Alistipes, and lower relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, and two genera within the Lachnospiraceae: Agathobacer and Coprococcus. However, we did not observe a different Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio between OCD cases and controls. Analysis of the oropharyngeal microbiome composition showed a lower Fusobacteria to Actinobacteria ratio in OCD cases. In conclusion, we observed an imbalance in the gut and oropharyngeal microbiomes of OCD cases, including, in stool, an increase of bacteria from the Rikenellaceae family, associated with gut inflammation, and a decrease of bacteria from the Coprococcus genus, associated with DOPAC synthesis.",-1
Hybrid Feature Selection Framework for the Parkinson Imbalanced Dataset Prediction Problem,"Background and Objectives: Recently, many studies have focused on the early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). This disease belongs to a group of neurological problems that immediately affect brain cells and influence the movement, hearing, and various cognitive functions. Medical data sets are often not equally distributed in their classes and this gives a bias in the classification of patients. We performed a Hybrid feature selection framework that can deal with imbalanced datasets like PD. Use the SOMTE algorithm to deal with unbalanced datasets. Removing the contradiction from the features in the dataset and decrease the processing time by using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Materials and Methods: PD acoustic datasets and the characteristics of control subjects were used to construct classification models such as Bagging, K-nearest neighbour (KNN), multilayer perceptron, and the support vector machine (SVM). In the prepressing stage, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) with two-feature selection RFE and PCA were used. The PD dataset comprises a large difference between the numbers of the infected and uninfected patients, which causes the classification bias problem. Therefore, SMOTE was used to resolve this problem. Results: For model evaluation, the train-test split technique was used for the experiment. All the models were Grid-search tuned, the evaluation results of the SVM model showed the highest accuracy of 98.2%, and the KNN model exhibited the highest specificity of 99%. Conclusions: the proposed method is compared with the current modern methods of detecting Parkinson's disease and other methods for medical diseases, it was noted that our developed system could treat data bias and reach a high prediction of PD and this can be beneficial for health organizations to properly prioritize assets.",-1
Temporal Patterns of Spontaneous Fixational Eye Movements: The Influence of Basal Ganglia,"Background:                    Spontaneity is a unique feature of the nervous system. One of the fundamentally critical and recognized forms of spontaneous motor activity is witnessed in the visuomotor system. Microsaccades, the miniature spontaneous eye movements, are critical for the visual perception. We hypothesized that microsaccades follow specific temporal patterns that are modulated by the basal ganglia output.              Methods:                    We used high-resolution video-oculography to capture microsaccades in 48 subjects (31 healthy and 17 with Parkinson's disease) when subjects were asked to hold their gaze on a straight-ahead target projected on white background. We analyzed spontaneous discharge patterns of microsaccades.              Results:                    The first analysis considering coefficient of variation in intersaccadic interval distribution demonstrated that microsaccades in Parkinson's disease are more dispersed than the control group. The second analysis scrutinized microsaccades' temporal variability and revealed 3 distinct occurrence patterns: regular rhythmic, clustered, and randomly occurring following a Poisson-like process. The regular pattern was relatively more common in Parkinson's disease. Subthalamic DBS modulated this temporal pattern. The amount of change in the temporal variability depended on the DBS-induced volume of tissue activation and its overlap with the subthalamic nucleus. The third analysis determined the autocorrelations of microsaccades within 2-second time windows. We found that Parkinson's disease altered local temporal organization in microsaccade generation, and DBS had a modulatory effect.              Conclusion:                    The microsaccades occur in 3 temporal patterns. The basal ganglia are one of the modulators of the microsaccade spontaneity.",-1
"Chemical Compounds of Berry-Derived Polyphenols and Their Effects on Gut Microbiota, Inflammation, and Cancer","Berry-derived polyphenols are bioactive compounds synthesized and secreted by several berry fruits. These polyphenols feature a diversity of chemical compounds, including phenolic acids and flavonoids. Here, we report the beneficial health effects of berry-derived polyphenols and their therapeutical application on gut-microbiota-related diseases, including inflammation and cancer. Pharmacokinetic investigations have confirmed the absorption, availability, and metabolism of berry-derived polyphenols. In vitro and in vivo tests, as well as clinical trials, showed that berry-derived polyphenols can positively modulate the gut microbiota, inhibiting inflammation and cancer development. Indeed, these compounds inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and also promote beneficial bacteria. Moreover, berry-derived polyphenols exhibit therapeutic effects against different gut-microbiota-related disorders such as inflammation, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Moreover, these polyphenols can manage the inflammation via various mechanisms, in particular the inhibition of the transcriptional factor Nf-ÎºB. Berry-derived polyphenols have also shown remarkable effects on different types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, esophageal, and prostate cancer. Moreover, certain metabolic disorders such as diabetes and atherosclerosis were also managed by berry-derived polyphenols through different mechanisms. These data showed that polyphenols from berries are a promising source of bioactive compounds capable of modulating the intestinal microbiota, and therefore managing cancer and associated metabolic diseases. However, further investigations should be carried out to determine the mechanisms of action of berry-derived polyphenol bioactive compounds to validate their safety and examinate their clinical uses.",-1
Higher gametocyte production and mosquito infectivity in chronic compared to incident Plasmodium falciparum infections,"Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte kinetics and infectivity may differ between chronic and incident infections. In the current study, we assess parasite kinetics and infectivity to mosquitoes among children (aged 5-10 years) from Burkina Faso with (a) incident infections following parasite clearance (n = 48) and (b) chronic asymptomatic infections (n = 60). In the incident infection cohort, 92% (44/48) of children develop symptoms within 35 days, compared to 23% (14/60) in the chronic cohort. All individuals with chronic infection carried gametocytes or developed them during follow-up, whereas only 35% (17/48) in the incident cohort produce gametocytes before becoming symptomatic and receiving treatment. Parasite multiplication rate (PMR) and the relative abundance of ap2-g and gexp-5 transcripts are positively associated with gametocyte production. Antibody responses are higher and PMR lower in chronic infections. The presence of symptoms and sexual stage immune responses are associated with reductions in gametocyte infectivity to mosquitoes. We observe that most incident infections require treatment before the density of mature gametocytes is sufficient to infect mosquitoes. In contrast, chronic, asymptomatic infections represent a significant source of mosquito infections. Our observations support the notion that malaria transmission reduction may be expedited by enhanced case management, involving both symptom-screening and infection detection.",-1
Residual Malaria Transmission in Select Countries of Asia-Pacific Region: Old Wine in a New Barrel,"Background:                    Despite substantial reductions in malaria burden and improvement in case management, malaria remains a major public health challenge in the Asia-Pacific region. Residual malaria transmission (RMT) is the fraction of total transmission that persists after achievement of full operational coverage with effective insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)/long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and/or indoor residual spray interventions. There is a critical need to standardize and share best practices for entomological, anthropological, and product development investigative protocols to meet the challenges of RMT and elimination goals.              Methods:                    A systematic review was conducted to describe when and where RMT is occurring, while specifically targeting ownership and usage of ITN/LLINs, indoor residual spray application, insecticide susceptibility of vectors, and human and vector biting behavior, with a focus on nighttime activities.              Results:                    Sixty-six publications from 1995 to present met the inclusion criteria for closer review. Associations between local vector control coverage and use with behaviors of human and mosquito vectors varied by locality and circumstance. Consequently, the magnitude of RMT is insufficiently studied and analyzed with sparse estimates of individual exposure in communities, insufficient or incomplete observations of ITN/LLIN use, and the local human population movement into and from high-risk areas.              Conclusions:                    This review identified significant gaps or deficiencies that require urgent attention, namely, developing standardized procedures and methods to estimate risk exposure beyond the peridomestic setting, analytical approaches to measure key human-vector interactions, and seasonal location-specific agricultural or forest use calendars, and establishing the collection of longitudinal human and vector data close in time and location.",-1
Late-onset Group B Streptococcus Bacteremia Evaluated in the Pediatric Emergency Department and Risk Factors for Severe Infection,"Background:                    To describe the infants presenting to pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) and diagnosed with group B Streptococcus (GBS) late-onset disease (LOD) bacteremia and identify risk factors for severe infection and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission.              Methods:                    Observational study and subanalysis of a multicenter prospective registry. Setting: pediatric emergency department. Inclusion criteria: infants between 7 and 89 days of age with positive blood culture for GBS seen between 2011 and 2016 at any of 22 Spanish PEDs. Main outcome: risk factors (clinical and laboratory variables) for severe infection (sepsis/septic shock or meningitis) and PICU admission. Second, the prevalence of poor outcomes (acute complications, sequelae or death).              Results:                    Among 118 patients with LOD, 74 (62.7%) presented a severe infection: 66 sepsis/septic shock (11 with associated meningitis) and 8 meningitis. Thirty-five patients (29.7%) were admitted to a PICU. An altered Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT) upon arrival and leukopenia were the only independent risk factors for severe infection [odds ratio (OR): 43.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.1-235.7, P < 0.01] and PICU admission (OR: 11.6; 95% CI: 1.5-91.4; P < 0.019), respectively. Six patients (5.1%) developed a poor outcome, including 2 deaths (1.7%); all had an altered PAT, elevated procalcitonin (range 4.7-100 ng/ml), and were diagnosed with sepsis/septic shock and admitted to a PICU. Four developed leukopenia.              Conclusions:                    Infants with GBS LOD frequently develop sepsis/septic shock and bacterial meningitis, associated with non-negligible morbidity and mortality. Clinical appearance was the only risk factor for severe infection, whereas leukopenia was related to PICU admission.",-1
The Relationship Between Visceral Adiposity Index and Epicardial Adipose Tissue in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Introduction and aim:                    Cardiovascular diseases remain the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), visceral fat depot of the heart, was found to be associated with coronary artery disease in cardiac and non-cardiac patients. Increased visceral adiposity is associated with proinflammatory activity, impaired insulin sensitivity, increased risk of atherosclerosis and high mortality. In the present study we aimed to investigate the relationship between EAT and visceral adiposity index (VAI) in patients with diabetes.              Methods:                    This was a cross-sectional study involving 128 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (73 females, 55 males; mean age, 54.09+Â±+9.17 years) and 32 control subjects (23 females, 9 males; mean age, 50.09+Â±+7.81 years). EAT was measured by using a trans-thoracic echocardiograph. Parameters such as waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were used to calculate VAI.              Result:                    EAT and VAI measurements were significantly higher in patients with diabetes when compared to control subjects. In the bivariate correlation analysis, VAI was positively correlated with uric acid level (r=0.214, p=0.015), white blood cell count (r= 0.262, p=0.003), platelet count (r=0.223, p=0.011) and total cholesterol levels (r= 0.363, p<0.001). Also, VAI was found to be the independent predictor of EAT.              Conclusion:                    Simple calculation of VAI was found to be associated with increased EAT in patients with type 2 diabetes.",-1
The impact of poor medication knowledge on health-related quality of life in people with Parkinson's disease: a mediation analysis,"Purpose:                    This study aimed to determine how limited medication knowledge as one aspect of health literacy contributes to poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).              Methods:                    Demographical data, PD-specific data (MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale, Nonmotor symptom scale), and data about depressive symptoms (Beck's depression inventory), cognition (Montreal cognitive assessment), HRQoL (Short-Form Health Questionnaire-36, SF-36), and medication knowledge (names, time of taking, indication, dosage) were assessed in 193 patients with PD. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), multivariate analysis of covariance, and mediation analyses were used to study the relationship between medication knowledge and HRQoL in combination with different mediators and covariates.              Results:                    Overall, 43.5% patients showed deficits in at least one of the 4 knowledge items, which was associated with higher age, number of medications per day and depression level, and poorer cognitive function, motor function, and lower education level. Using one-way MANOVA, we identified that medication knowledge significantly impacts physical functioning, social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, and role limitations due to emotional problems. Mediation models using age, education level, and gender as covariates showed that the relationship between knowledge and SF-36 domains was fully mediated by Beck's Depression Inventory but not by Montreal Cognitive Assessment.              Conclusions:                    Patients who expressed unawareness of their medication did not necessarily have cognitive deficits; however, depressive symptoms may instead be present. This concomitant depressive symptomatology is crucial in explaining the contribution of nonadherence and decreased medication knowledge to poor quality of life.",-1
Work disability in rheumatic diseases: Baseline results from an inception cohort,"Aim:                    We aimed to characterize work disability in patients with newly diagnosed rheumatic diseases and compare work characteristics between patients with rheumatic diseases and controls without rheumatic diseases at diagnosis.              Methods:                    Patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) and osteoarthritis (OA), surrogates for autoimmune and non-autoimmune rheumatic diseases, respectively, and controls of working age were surveyed at diagnosis. Patients with rheumatic diseases who were employed before symptom onset were characterized as having work disability if they reported reduced work ability and productivity while remaining in the same job as before symptom onset, changed to a less demanding job or stopped working/retired. Work characteristics at diagnosis were compared between rheumatic diseases patients and controls.              Results:                    The unemployment rate before symptom onset was lower in patients with IA (20%) compared to patients with OA (32%). Among patients with IA and OA who were employed before symptom onset, 59% and 43% reported work disability, respectively (P = .04). The unemployment rate at diagnosis was comparable in patients with IA (26%) and higher in patients with OA (38%) compared to controls (29%). Employed patients with IA and OA, when compared with controls, reported poorer work ability (score: 37 vs 39 vs 41, P < .01; proportion with poor/moderate work ability: 48% vs 33% vs 21%, P < .01) and greater work productivity loss (score: 32 vs 29 vs 17, P < .01) at diagnosis.              Conclusion:                    Rheumatic diseases impose significant work disability at diagnosis, highlighting the need for identification and interventions targeting work disability early in the course of disease.",-1
"Argonaute-CLIP delineates versatile, functional RNAi networks in Aedes aegypti, a major vector of human viruses","Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind small RNAs to silence complementary RNA transcripts, and they are central to RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is critical for regulation of gene expression and antiviral defense in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which transmit Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. In mosquitoes, AGO1 mediates miRNA interactions, while AGO2 mediates siRNA interactions. We applied AGO-crosslinking immunoprecipitation (AGO-CLIP) for both AGO1 and AGO2, and we developed a universal software package for CLIP analysis (CLIPflexR), identifying 230 small RNAs and 5,447 small RNA targets that comprise a comprehensive RNAi network map in mosquitoes. RNAi network maps predicted expression levels of small RNA targets in specific tissues. Additionally, this resource identified unexpected, context-dependent AGO2 target preferences, including endogenous viral elements and 3'UTRs. Finally, contrary to current thinking, mosquito AGO2 repressed imperfect targets. These findings expand our understanding of small RNA networks and have broad implications for the study of antiviral RNAi.",-1
Functional Role of microRNAs in Regulating Cardiomyocyte Death,"microRNAs (miRNA, miRs) play crucial roles in cardiovascular disease regulating numerous processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell death. Herein, we present an updated and comprehensive overview of the functional involvement of miRs in the regulation of cardiomyocyte death, a central event in acute myocardial infarction, ischemia/reperfusion, and heart failure. Specifically, in this systematic review we are focusing on necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy.",-1
Associations of Maternal Psychological Distress during Pregnancy with Childhood General and Organ Fat Measures,"Background: Psychological distress during pregnancy may influence offspring adiposity. No studies assessed the associations with organ fat measures. We examined the associations of maternal psychological distress, depression, and anxiety during pregnancy with child general and organ fat measures. Methods: In 4161 mother-offspring pairs, psychological distress was self-reported in pregnancy. We obtained general fat measures, including BMI and fat mass index by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and organ fat measures (in a subsample of 2447 children), including subcutaneous, visceral, and pericardial fat indices and liver fat fraction by magnetic resonance imaging at 10 years. Linear and logistic regression models were used. Results: Children of mothers with psychological distress had higher fat mass index [difference 0.14 (95% confidence interval {CI} 0.04-0.24) standard deviation scores (SDS)] and higher risk of obesity [odds ratio (OR) 1.73 (95% CI 1.09-2.74)]. Maternal anxiety was associated with higher BMI [difference 0.16 (95% CI 0.05-0.26) SDS], fat mass index [difference 0.19 (95% CI 0.10-0.28) SDS], and higher risks of overweight and obesity [OR 1.36 (95% CI 1.03-1.81), 1.78 (95% CI 1.13-2.81)]. Maternal anxiety was associated with higher subcutaneous and visceral fat indices and liver fat fraction [differences 0.16 (95% CI 0.03-0.29), 0.15 (95% CI 0.01-0.29), and 0.16 (95% CI 0.02-0.29) SDS]. No associations were observed for maternal depression. Conclusions: Psychological distress and anxiety, but not depression, during pregnancy were associated with higher child general and organ fat measures. A healthy mental state during pregnancy may be important for preventing child adiposity.",-1
An Overview of the TRP-Oxidative Stress Axis in Metabolic Syndrome: Insights for Novel Therapeutic Approaches,"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a complex pathology characterized by visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. It has become a global epidemic associated with increased consumption of high-calorie, low-fibre food and sedentary habits. Some of its underlying mechanisms have been identified, with hypoadiponectinemia, inflammation and oxidative stress as important factors for MS establishment and progression. Alterations in adipokine levels may favour glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity which, in turn, contribute to inflammation and cellular stress responses within the adipose, pancreatic and liver tissues, in addition to hepatic steatosis. The multiple mechanisms of MS make its clinical management difficult, involving both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are non-selective calcium channels involved in a plethora of physiological events, including energy balance, inflammation and oxidative stress. Evidence from animal models of disease has contributed to identify their specific contributions to MS and may help to tailor clinical trials for the disease. In this context, the oxidative stress sensors TRPV1, TRPA1 and TRPC5, play major roles in regulating inflammatory responses, thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Here, the interplay between these TRP channels and oxidative stress in MS is discussed in the light of novel therapies to treat this syndrome.",-1
Obesity and male hypogonadism: Tales of a vicious cycle,"Obesity prevalence, particularly in children and young adults, is perilously increasing worldwide foreseeing serious negative health impacts in the future to come. Obesity is linked to impaired male gonadal function and is currently a major cause of hypogonadism. Besides signs and symptoms directly derived from decreased circulating testosterone levels, males with obesity also present poor fertility outcomes, further evidencing the parallelism between obesity and male reproductive function. In addition, males with androgen deficiency also exhibit increased fat accumulation and reduced muscle and mineral bone mass. Thus, compelling evidence highlights a vicious cycle where male hypogonadism can lead to increased adiposity, while obesity can be a cause for male hypogonadism. On the opposite direction, sustained weight loss can attain amelioration of male gonadal function. In this scenario, a thorough evaluation of gonadal function in men with obesity is crucial to dissect the causes from the consequences in order to target clinical interventions towards maximized improvement of reproductive health. This review will address the causes and consequences of the bidirectional relationship between obesity and hypogonadism, highlighting the implicit male reproductive repercussions.",-1
The Role of Inflammasomes in Glomerulonephritis,"The inflammasome is an immune multiprotein complex that activates pro-caspase 1 in response to inflammation-inducing stimuli and it leads to IL-1Î² and IL-18 proinflammatory cytokine production. NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes are the best characterized and they have been related to several autoimmune diseases. It is well known that the kidney expresses inflammasome genes, which can influence the development of some glomerulonephritis, such as lupus nephritis, ANCA glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy and anti-GBM nephropathy. Polymorphisms of these genes have also been described to play a role in autoimmune and kidney diseases. In this review, we describe the main characteristics, activation mechanisms, regulation and functions of the different inflammasomes. Moreover, we discuss the latest findings about the role of the inflammasome in several glomerulonephritis from three different points of view: in vitro, animal and human studies.",-1
Long COVID: The Nature of Thrombotic Sequelae Determines the Necessity of Early Anticoagulation,"Many discharged COVID-19 patients affected by sequelae experience reduced quality of life leading to an increased burden on the healthcare system, their families and society at large. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms of long COVID include: persistent viral replication, chronic hypoxia and inflammation. Ongoing vascular endothelial damage promotes platelet adhesion and coagulation, resulting in the impairment of various organ functions. Meanwhile, thrombosis will further aggravate vasculitis contributing to further deterioration. Thus, long COVID is essentially a thrombotic sequela. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for long COVID. This article summarizes the evidence for coagulation abnormalities in long COVID, with a focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by various types of cells can carry SARS-CoV-2 through the circulation and attack distant tissues and organs. Furthermore, EVs express tissue factor and phosphatidylserine (PS) which aggravate thrombosis. Given the persistence of the virus, chronic inflammation and endothelial damage are inevitable. Pulmonary structural changes such as hypertension, embolism and fibrosis are common in long COVID. The resulting impaired lung function and chronic hypoxia again aggravates vascular inflammation and coagulation abnormalities. In this article, we also summarize recent research on antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19. There is increasing evidence that early anticoagulation can be effective in improving outcomes. In fact, persistent systemic vascular inflammation and dysfunction caused by thrombosis are key factors driving various complications of long COVID. Early prophylactic anticoagulation can prevent the release of or remove procoagulant substances, thereby protecting the vascular endothelium from damage, reducing thrombotic sequelae, and improving quality of life for long-COVID patients.",-1
ox-LDL regulates proliferation and apoptosis in VSMCs by controlling the miR-183-5p/FOXO1,"Background:                    microRNA-mRNA axes that are involved in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation/apoptosis imbalance need to be further investigated.              Objective:                    To investigate the functional role of miR-183-5p/FOXO1 in VSMCs and its interaction with ox-LDL.              Methods:                    RNA sequencing was used to detect transcriptome changes of VSMCs treated with ox-LDL. miR-183-5p and FOXO1 expression levels in VSMCs after ox-LDL treatment were assessed using qRT-PCR and western blotting. The regulatory effect of miR-183-5p on FOXO1 has been tried to prove using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The functions of miR-183-5p, and FOXO1 were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry assay. The tissue samples or serum samples of high fat-feeding mice and carotid atherosclerosis patients were collected, and the levels of miR-183-5p/FOXO1 were analyzed.              Results:                    RNA sequencing data showed 81 miRNAs including miR-183-5p was significantly changed after ox-LDL treatment in VSMCs. FOXO1, a miR-183-5p's potential target, was also down-regulated in ox-LDL treated cells. qRT-PCR and western blot found that expression of FOXO1 mRNA and protein significantly reduced in VSMCs treated with ox-LDL, accompanied by overexpression of miR-183-5p. miR-183-5p inhibited FOXO1 mRNA by binding to its 3' UTR. Interference miR-183-5p/FOXO1 could change proliferation/apoptosis imbalance in VSMCs under ox-LDL stimulation. Higher levels of miR-183-5p but reduced FOXO1 can be found in the thoracic aorta tissues of high fat-feeding mice. In serum samples from individuals with carotid atherosclerosis, Higher levels of miR-183-5p were observed. the miR-183-5p level was positively related to the level of serum ox-LDL in patients.              Conclusions:                    Aberrant expression of miR-183-5p/FOXO1 pathway mediated ox-LDL-induced proliferation/apoptosis imbalance in VSMCs. The miR-183-5p/FOXO1 axis can potentially be utilized as the target in the treatment of patients with atherosclerosis.",-1
"Fitness costs of individual and combined pyrethroid resistance mechanisms, kdr and CYP-mediated detoxification, in Aedes aegypti","Background:                    Aedes aegypti is an important vector of many human diseases and a serious threat to human health due to its wide geographic distribution and preference for human hosts. A. aegypti also has evolved widespread resistance to pyrethroids due to the extensive use of this insecticide class over the past decades. Mutations that cause insecticide resistance result in fitness costs in the absence of insecticides. The fitness costs of pyrethroid resistance mutations in A. aegypti are still poorly understood despite their implications for arbovirus transmission.              Methodology/principle findings:                    We evaluated fitness based both on allele-competition and by measuring specific fitness components (i.e. life table and mating competition) to determine the costs of the different resistance mechanisms individually and in combination. We used four congenic A. aegypti strains: Rockefeller (ROCK) is susceptible to insecticides; KDR:ROCK (KR) contains only voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Vssc) mutations S989P+V1016G (kdr); CYP:ROCK (CR) contains only CYP-mediated resistance; and CYP+KDR:ROCK (CKR) contains both CYP-mediated resistance and kdr. The kdr allele frequency decreased over nine generations in the allele-competition study regardless of the presence of CYP-mediated resistance. Specific fitness costs were variable by strain and component measured. CR and CKR had a lower net reproductive rate (R0) than ROCK or KR, and KR was not different than ROCK. There was no correlation between the level of permethrin resistance conferred by the different mechanisms and their fitness cost ratio. We also found that CKR males had a reduced mating success relative to ROCK males when attempting to mate with ROCK females.              Conclusions/significance:                    Both kdr and CYP-mediated resistance have a fitness cost affecting different physiological aspects of the mosquito. CYP-mediated resistance negatively affected adult longevity and mating competition, whereas the specific fitness costs of kdr remains elusive. Understanding fitness costs helps us determine whether and how quickly resistance will be lost after pesticide application has ceased.",-1
Screening and Diagnosis of Prediabetes and Diabetes in US Children and Adolescents,"Background:                    The optimal approach to screening and diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes in youth is uncertain.              Methods:                    We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 14 119 youth aged 10 to 19 years in the 1999-2016 NHANES. First, we examined the performance of American Diabetes Association risk-based screening criteria. Second, we evaluated the performance of current clinical definitions of prediabetes and diabetes based on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), either HbA1c or FPG, or both HbA1c and FPG (confirmatory definition) to identify youth at high cardiometabolic risk.              Results:                    Overall, 25.5% of US youth (10.6 million in 2016) were eligible for screening. Sensitivity and specificity of the screening criteria for detecting any hyperglycemia were low for both HbA1c â?.7% (sensitivity = 55.5%, specificity = 76.3%) and FPG â?00 mg/dL (sensitivity = 35.8%, specificity = 77.1%). Confirmed undiagnosed diabetes (HbA1c â?.5% and FPG â?26 mg/dL) was rare, <0.5% of youth. Most (>85%) cases of diabetes were diagnosed. Associations with cardiometabolic risk were consistently stronger and more specific for HbA1c-defined hyperglycemia (specificity = 98.6%; sensitivity = 4.0%) than FPG-defined hyperglycemia (specificity = 90.1%; sensitivity = 19.4%).              Conclusions:                    One-quarter of US youth are eligible for screening for diabetes and prediabetes; however, few will test positive, especially for diabetes. Most cases of diabetes in US youth are diagnosed. Regardless of screening eligibility, we found that HbA1c is a specific and useful nonfasting test to identify high-risk youth who could benefit from lifestyle interventions to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular risk in adulthood.",-1
"Maternal caregivers have confluence of altered cortisol, high reward-driven eating, and worse metabolic health","Animal models have shown that chronic stress increases cortisol, which contributes to overeating of highly palatable food, increased abdominal fat and lower cortisol reactivity. Few studies in humans have simultaneously examined these trajectories. We examined premenopausal women, either mothers of children with a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder (n = 92) or mothers of neurotypical children (n = 91). At baseline and 2-years, we assessed hair cortisol, metabolic health, and reward-based eating. We compared groups cross-sectionally and prospectively, accounting for BMI change. Caregivers, relative to controls, had lower cumulative hair cortisol at each time point, with no decreases over time. Caregivers also had stable levels of poor metabolic functioning and greater reward-based eating across both time points, and evidenced increased abdominal fat prospectively (all ps â?05), independent of change in BMI. This pattern of findings suggest that individuals under chronic stress, such as caregivers, would benefit from tailored interventions focusing on better regulation of stress and eating in tandem to prevent early onset of metabolic disease, regardless of weight status.",-1
Effect of Hemoglobin A1c Trajectories on Future Outcomes in a 10-Year Cohort With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Background:                    Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) variability may be a predictor of diabetic complications, but the predictive values of HbA1c trajectories remain unclear. We aimed to classify long-term HbA1c trajectories and to explore their effects on future clinical outcomes in a 10-year cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).              Methods:                    A total of 2,161 participants with T2DM from the Beijing Community Diabetes Study were included. The 10-year follow-up was divided into two stages for the present data analysis. Stage I (from 2008 to 2014) was used to identify the HbA1c trajectories and to calculate the adjusted SD of HbA1c (HbA1c-adjSD), or the coefficient of variation of HbA1c (HbA1c-CV). Stage II (from 2014 to 2018) was used to collect the records of the new occurrence of diabetes-related clinical outcomes. Latent growth mixture models were used to identify HbA1c trajectories. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the relationship between HbA1c trajectories, HbA1c-adjSD, or HbA1c-CV and the future outcomes.              Results:                    Three HbA1c trajectories were identified, including low stable (88.34%), gradual decreasing (5.83%), and pre-stable and post-increase (5.83%). Either the risk of death or the chronic complications were significantly higher in the latter two groups compared to the low stable group after adjustment for average HbA1c and other traditional risk factors, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for renal events, composite endpoint, and all-cause death for the pre-stable and post-increase group were 2.83 [95%CI: 1.25-6.41, p = 0.013], 1.85 (95%CI: 1.10-3.10, p = 0.020), and 3.01 (95%CI: 1.13-8.07, p = 0.028), respectively, and the adjusted HR for renal events for the gradual decreasing group was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.08-5.21, p = 0.032). In addition, both univariate and multivariate Cox HR models indicated that participants in the fourth and third quartiles of HbA1c-CV or HbA1c-adjSD were at higher risk of renal events compared to participants in the first quartile.              Conclusions:                    HbA1c trajectories, HbA1c-CV, and HbA1c-adjSD could all predict diabetes-related clinical outcomes. HbA1c trajectories could reflect long-term blood glucose fluctuation more intuitively, and non-stable HbA1c trajectories may predict increased risk of renal events, all-cause death, and composite endpoint events, independent of average HbA1c.",-1
"Controversies in the Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Treatment of PCOS: Focus on Insulin Resistance, Inflammation, and Hyperandrogenism","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous and extremely common disease with symptoms that vary with the age of the patient, typically characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic oligo-anovulation, and/or several metabolic disorders. The syndrome includes various phenotypes, and the pathogenesis is multifactorial, often involving insulin resistance. This feature is closely related to ovarian dysfunction, inflammation, hyperandrogenism, and metabolic disorders, which characterize and complicate the syndrome. Therapy currently considers both lifestyle improvements and medications, and must be tailored on a case-by-case basis. To date, the published studies have not arrived at a definition of the most suitable therapy for each individual case and many of the drugs used are still off-label. In this review, we discuss some controversial diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of PCOS, such as the role of insulin resistance, inflammation, and hyperandrogenism. We also evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of contraceptive therapy and antiandrogens.",-1
Altered levels of neurobiological biomarkers at the interface of depression and gestational diabetes mellitus in Asian Indian women,"Aim:                    Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) might predispose the mothers to depression. Studies have reported the role of biomarkers either in GDM or depression, but very few have examined them in GDM with depression. The present study profiled the circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Beta Endorphin (BE) and nesfatin-1 in women with GDM (with and without depression).              Methods:                    160 pregnant women at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy (NGT/GDM with & without depression, n = 40 each) were randomly selected from the ongoing STRiDE (STratification of Risk of Diabetes in Early pregnancy) study. Depression score was derived using PHQ-9 questionnaire and ELISA was used to quantify the biomarkers.              Results:                    Circulatory levels of BDNF, BE and nesfatin-1 were lower in GDM women with or without depression compared to NGT without depression, however, nesfatin-1 levels were higher in NGT with depression. Notably, GDM with depression had the lowest levels of BDNF and BE. Both BDNF and BE levels were negatively correlated with depression, 1 h and 2 h plasma glucose. Regression analysis confirmed that each standard deviation decreases in BDNF and BE were independently associated with higher odds of GDM with or without depression even after adjusting for potential confounders.              Conclusion:                    Our study has identified altered levels of a panel of neurobiological biomarkers (BDNF/BE/nesfatin-1) in those with combined GDM and depression. BDNF/BE could be potential biomarkers to assess the higher risk of coexisting depression and GDM.",-1
Association of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and thoracic aorta calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients with and without diabetes,"Background:                    Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is not only a bone-derived factor involved in metabolism, but also a biomarker of kidney disease and cardiovascular pathophysiology. We conducted this cross-sectional observational study to explore relationships between plasma NGAL and thoracic aorta calcification (TAC) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients with and without diabetes.              Methods:                    Plasma NGAL was measured by ELISA, TAC was evaluated via computed tomography scan using a 3D quantification method or chest radiography aortic arch calcification score. Spearman correlation, Logistic regression and Partial correlation analysis were used to describe the correlations between NGAL and TAC.              Results:                    Plasma NGAL levels were lower in MHD patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (49.33(42.37, 55.48) vs 56.78(44.37, 674.13) ng/mL, P = 0.026). In MHD patients without diabetes, lg (NGAL) was positively correlated with ARC value(R = 0.612, P = 0.003) analyzed by Spearman correlation; for partial correlation analysis, lg (NGAL) was positively correlated with ARC value, after adjusting for age and sex (R = 0.550, P = 0.015), adjusting for age, sex and CHD (R = 0.565, P = 0.015), adjusting for age, sex, CHD and Alb (R = 0.536, P = 0.027), or adjusting for age, sex, CHD, Alb, and dialyzer membrane (polysulfone) (R = 0.590, P = 0.016); however, when adjusting for age, sex, CHD, Alb and Ca, the correlation between lg (NGAL) and ARC value disappeared. Positive correlation were found between NGAL and Ca (R = 0.644, P < 0.001), Ca and ACR (R = 0.534, P = 0.013) in Spearman coefficient analysis.              Conclusion:                    There were positive correlations among plasma NGAL, serum Ca and ARC in MHD patients without diabetes; which suggests that NGAL is possibly a participant in cardiovascular calcification, in non-diabetic MHD.",-1
A review of multiomics platforms in pituitary adenoma pathogenesis,"Pituitary adenomas (PA), or pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs), represent 15% of all central nervous system tumors. Classic description of PitNETs solely by hormonal classification has given way to key transcription factors that play a role in the pathology of PitNETs including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), t-box pituitary transcription factor (TPIT), and pituitary transcription factor 1 (PIT-1). Germline mutations in various familial PitNETs are discussed including those in familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), and Carney complex. Recent advances in next generation sequencing have improved insight into the pathogenesis of PitNETs. A review of key studies in evaluating the genomic analysis of PitNETs was performed. Chromosomal mutations, whole exome sequencing, microRNA genomics, methylomics and transcriptomics were analyzed. Moreover, the multiomic analysis of various genomic panels has helped to better understand PA classification.",-1
Taurine protects dopaminergic neurons in paraquat-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model through PI3K/Akt signaling pathways,"Taurine (Tau) is one of the most abundant amino acids in the brain and regulates physiological functions in the central nervous system, including anti-inflammatory effects. There is growing evidence that microglia-mediated neuro-inflammatory responses are an integral part of Parkinson's disease (PD) onset and progression. Among the many factors regulating the inflammatory response, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) is susceptible to activation by a variety of cytokines and physicochemical factors, and subsequently recruits signaling proteins containing the pleckstrin homology structural domain to further regulate protein kinase B (AKT) expression involved in the regulation of the intracellular immune response and inflammatory response. Therefore, we established a PD mouse model using paraquat (PQ) intraperitoneal injection staining to explore the mechanism of Tau action on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our study showed that PD mice with Tau intervention recovered motor and non-motor functions to some extent, and the number of dopaminergic (DAc) neurons in the substantia nigra and the level of dopamine (DA) secretion in the striatum were also significantly increased compared with the PQ-dyed group, and the protein content of PI3K and PDK-1 and the phosphorylation level of AKT were reduced in parallel with the reduction in the expression of microglia and related inflammatory factors. In conclusion, our results suggest that Tau may regulate microglia-mediated inflammatory responses through inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the midbrain of PD mice, thereby reducing DAc neurons damage.",-1
Studying and mitigating the effects of data drifts on ML model performance at the example of chemical toxicity data,"Machine learning models are widely applied to predict molecular properties or the biological activity of small molecules on a specific protein. Models can be integrated in a conformal prediction (CP) framework which adds a calibration step to estimate the confidence of the predictions. CP models present the advantage of ensuring a predefined error rate under the assumption that test and calibration set are exchangeable. In cases where the test data have drifted away from the descriptor space of the training data, or where assay setups have changed, this assumption might not be fulfilled and the models are not guaranteed to be valid. In this study, the performance of internally valid CP models when applied to either newer time-split data or to external data was evaluated. In detail, temporal data drifts were analysed based on twelve datasets from the ChEMBL database. In addition, discrepancies between models trained on publicly-available data and applied to proprietary data for the liver toxicity and MNT in vivo endpoints were investigated. In most cases, a drastic decrease in the validity of the models was observed when applied to the time-split or external (holdout) test sets. To overcome the decrease in model validity, a strategy for updating the calibration set with data more similar to the holdout set was investigated. Updating the calibration set generally improved the validity, restoring it completely to its expected value in many cases. The restored validity is the first requisite for applying the CP models with confidence. However, the increased validity comes at the cost of a decrease in model efficiency, as more predictions are identified as inconclusive. This study presents a strategy to recalibrate CP models to mitigate the effects of data drifts. Updating the calibration sets without having to retrain the model has proven to be a useful approach to restore the validity of most models.",-1
Intranasal Exposure to Low-Dose Rotenone Induced Alpha-Synuclein Accumulation and Parkinson's Like Symptoms Without Loss of Dopaminergic Neurons,"Epidemiologically Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with chronic ingestion or inhalation of environmental toxins leading to the development of motor symptoms. Though neurotoxin-based animal models played a major role in understanding diverse pathogenesis, they failed to identify the risk assessment due to uncommon route of toxin exposure. Towards this, the available neurotoxin-based intranasal (i.n.) PD models targeting olfactory bulb (OB) have demonstrated the dopaminergic (DAergic) neurodegeneration in both OB and substantia nigra (SN). Despite that, the studies detecting the alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) accumulation in OB and its progression to other brain regions due to inhalation of environmental toxins are still lacking. Herein, we developed oil in water microemulsion of rotenone administered intranasally to the mice at a dose which is not detectable in blood, brain, and olfactory bulb by LCMS method. Our data reveals that 9 weeks of rotenone exposure did not induce olfactory and motor dysfunction. Conversely, after 16 weeks of washout period, rotenone treated mice showed both olfactory and motor impairment, along with Î±-syn accumulation in the OB and striatum without glial cell activation and loss of dopaminergic neurons. The results depict the progressive nature of the developed model and highlight the role of Î±-syn in PD like pathology or symptoms. Together, our findings suggest the adverse consequences of early exposure to the environmental toxins on the olfactory system for a shorter period with relevance to the development of synucleinopathy or Parkinson's disease in its later stage.",-1
Convolutional neural network for automatic maxillary sinus segmentation on cone-beam computed tomographic images,"An accurate three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of the maxillary sinus is crucial for multiple diagnostic and treatment applications. Yet, it is challenging and time-consuming when manually performed on a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) dataset. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to provide excellent performance in the field of 3D image analysis. Hence, this study developed and validated a novel automated CNN-based methodology for the segmentation of maxillary sinus using CBCT images. A dataset of 264 sinuses were acquired from 2 CBCT devices and randomly divided into 3 subsets: training, validation, and testing. A 3D U-Net architecture CNN model was developed and compared to semi-automatic segmentation in terms of time, accuracy, and consistency. The average time was significantly reduced (p-value < 2.2e-16) by automatic segmentation (0.4 min) compared to semi-automatic segmentation (60.8 min). The model accurately identified the segmented region with a dice similarity co-efficient (DSC) of 98.4%. The inter-observer reliability for minor refinement of automatic segmentation showed an excellent DSC of 99.6%. The proposed CNN model provided a time-efficient, precise, and consistent automatic segmentation which could allow an accurate generation of 3D models for diagnosis and virtual treatment planning.",-1
Retinal Biomarkers for Alzheimer Disease: The Facts and the Future,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options and considerable diagnostic challenges. Identification and validation of retinal changes that correlate with clinicopathologic features of AD could provide a noninvasive method of screening and monitoring progression of disease, with notable implications for developing new therapies, particularly in its preclinical stages. Retinal biomarkers that have been studied to date include structural changes in neurosensory retinal layers, alterations in vascular architecture and function, and pathologic deposition of proteins within the retina, which have all demonstrated variable correlation with the presence of preclinical or clinical AD. Evolution of specialized retinal imaging modalities and advances in artificial intelligence hold great promise for future study in this burgeoning field. The current status of research in retinal biomarkers, and some of the challenges that will need to be addressed in future work, are reviewed herein.",-1
"Visceral obesity, but not central obesity, is associated with cardiac remodeling in subjects with suspected metabolic syndrome","Background and aims:                    Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of multiple risk factors including central obesity that may lead to cardiac damage and cardiovascular events. We investigated whether visceral obesity induces cardiac structural and functional remodeling independently from central obesity and other risk factors in subjects with suspected MetS.              Methods and results:                    We studied 229 participants with suspected MetS. Visceral fat area (VFA) was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Left ventricular (LV) mass index, early diastolic velocity of mitral annulus (e'), and LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) were measured by echocardiography. Subjects were categorized into high and low VFA group (VFAh and VFAl). MetS was more prevalent in the VFAh than in the VFAl (p = 0.004). The VFAh had a higher waist circumference (WC) than the VFAl (p < 0.001). LV mass index was higher, but e' and GLS were lower in the VFAh than in VFAl (all p < 0.05). VFA was well correlated with blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and adiponectin (all p < 0.05). VFA was correlated to LV mass index, e', and GLS (all p < 0.05) and was independently associated with GLS after adjustment for other risk factors, including WC (p = 0.005).              Conclusions:                    Visceral obesity assessed by VFA was well correlated with parameters of MetS. Visceral obesity, but not central obesity measured by WC, was independently associated with structural and functional cardiac remodeling in subjects with suspected MetS. It suggests that visceral obesity should be considered as an important risk factor for cardiac damage in dysmetabolic subjects.

Constitutive Activation of Î²-Catenin in Conventional Dendritic Cells Increases the Insulin Reserve to Ameliorate the Development of Type 2 Diabetes in Mice,"Î²-Cell failure is central to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dysregulation of metabolic and inflammatory processes during obesity contributes to the loss of islet function and impaired Î²-cell insulin secretion. Modulating the immune system, therefore, has the potential to ameliorate diseases. We report that inducing sustained expression of Î²-catenin in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) provides a novel mechanism to enhance Î²-cell insulin secretion. Intriguingly, cDCs with constitutively activated Î²-catenin induced islet expansion by increasing Î²-cell proliferation in a model of diet-induced obesity. We further found that inflammation in these islets was reduced. Combined, these effects improved Î²-cell insulin secretion, suggesting a unique compensatory mechanism driven by cDCs to generate a greater insulin reserve in response to obesity-induced insulin resistance. Our findings highlight the potential of immune modulation to improve Î²-cell mass and function in T2DM.",-1
miRNA-guided reprogramming of glucose and glutamine metabolism and its impact on cell adhesion/migration during solid tumor progression,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs about 22 nucleotides in length that regulate the expression of target genes post-transcriptionally, and are highly involved in cancer progression. They are able to impact a variety of cell processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation and can consequently control tumor initiation, tumor progression and metastasis formation. miRNAs can regulate, at the same time, metabolic gene expression which, in turn, influences relevant traits of malignancy such as cell adhesion, migration and invasion. Since the interaction between metabolism and adhesion or cell movement has not, to date, been well understood, in this review, we will specifically focus on miRNA alterations that can interfere with some metabolic processes leading to the modulation of cancer cell movement. In addition, we will analyze the signaling pathways connecting metabolism and adhesion/migration, alterations that often affect cancer cell dissemination and metastasis formation.",-1

The role of frailty in Parkinson's disease: a cross-sectional study,"Background:                    Frailty is an age-related state of increased risk for health-related adverse outcomes that reflects multisystem physiological changes and likely influences the clinical expression and disease progression of neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential relationship between frailty, as assessed by a frailty index (FI), and motor symptom severity, motor subtypes, and non-motor domains in Parkinson's disease (PD).              Methods:                    We consecutively enrolled 150 PD patients. We administered an FI specifically designed for PD that included 50 age-related multidimensional biological deficits. Patients underwent a clinical assessment that evaluated motor and non-motor manifestations of PD. Using the FI score, we classified PD patients as relatively fit (FI â?0.10), less fit (0.10 < FI â?0.21), or frail (FI > 0.21). A linear regression model was designed to explore possible associations between frailty level and PD motor and non-motor manifestations.              Results:                    Frail patients showed greater motor symptom severity and motor complications than fitter patients. A trend towards a higher prevalence of the postural instability/gait disorder subtype was also observed in frail versus relatively fit and less fit patients. The global burden of non-motor symptoms was higher in frail patients. Increased frailty was associated with more severe motor and non-motor symptoms, as well as with more pronounced cognitive deficits. These associations remained significant even when ""traditional"" predictors of PD severity (age, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily dose) were considered.              Conclusions:                    The present findings indicate that the FI is associated with both motor and non-motor features of PD.",-1
"Maresin-2 alleviates allergic airway inflammation in mice by inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, Th2 type immune response and oxidative stress","Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory system. Maresin-2 (MaR2) is biosynthesized from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by macrophages, display strong anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activity. To investigate the therapeutic effect and mechanism of MaR2 on asthmatic mice induced by ovalbumin (OVA) in conjunction with the adjuvant aluminum hydroxide. Twenty four female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into control, OVA, OVA + MaR2, and OVA + dexamethasone (Dexa) groups. MaR2 or Dexa were given as a treatment for OVA-induced asthma. Serum, bronchoalveolar alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were collected for further analysis. The Pathological changes of lung tissue, proportion of inflammatory cells in BALF, levels of inflammatory cytokines in BALF or serum, oxidative stress indices, and the protein concentration of ASC, MPO, Ly-6G, ICAM-1, NLRP3 and Caspase-1 in lung tissues were evaluated. Compared with the OVA group, both OVA + MaR2 and OVA + Dexa group had reduced inflammation and mucus secretion in lung tissue, number of inflammatory cells in BALF, levels of related inflammatory cytokines in serum or BALF, and expressions of ASC, MPO, Ly-6G, ICAM-1, NLRP3 and Caspase-1 proteins in lung tissue. In addition, the oxidative stress was alleviated as indicated by decreased MDA, and elevated SOD and GSH. MaR2 has an obvious protective effect on OVA-induced bronchial asthma in mice, in a similar manner as Dexa. The mechanism may be related to the inhibition of the Th2 type immune response, the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and oxidative stress.",-1
A peptide encoded by pri-miRNA-31 represses autoimmunity by promoting T reg differentiation,"Recent evidence has revealed that small polypeptides (containing fewer than 100 amino acids) can be translated from noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are usually defined as RNA molecules that do not encode proteins. However, studies on functional products translated from primary transcripts of microRNA (pri-miRNA) are quite limited. Here, we describe a peptide termed miPEP31 that is encoded by pri-miRNA-31. miPEP31 is highly expressed in Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs ) and significantly promotes the differentiation of Tregs without affecting their inhibitory ability. Our results show that miPEP31 is a cell-penetrating peptide both in vitro and in vivo. miPEP31 downregulates miR-31 expression, enhances peripheral Treg induction, and dramatically suppresses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Mechanistically, we show that miPEP31 acts as a transcriptional repressor inhibiting the expression of miRNA-31, a negative regulator of Tregs . Our results reveal an indispensable role of miPEP31 in maintaining immune homeostasis by promoting Treg differentiation and also present a potential therapeutic peptide for modulating miRNA expression and treating autoimmune diseases.",-1
Regulatory Processes of the Canonical Wnt/Î²-Catenin Pathway and Photobiomodulation in Diabetic Wound Repair,"Skin is a biological system composed of different types of cells within a firmly structured extracellular matrix and is exposed to various external and internal insults that can break its configuration. The restoration of skin's anatomic continuity and function following injury is a multifaceted, dynamic, well-coordinated process that is highly dependent on signalling pathways, including the canonical Wnt/Î² catenin pathway, all aimed at restoring the skin's protective barrier. Compromised and inappropriate tissue restoration processes are often the source of wound chronicity. Diabetic patients have a high risk of developing major impediments including wound contamination and limb amputation due to chronic, non-healing wounds. Photobiomodulation (PBM) involves the application of low-powered light at specific wavelengths to influence different biological activities that incite and quicken tissue restoration. PBM has been shown to modulate cellular behaviour through a variety of signal transduction pathways, including the Wnt/Î² catenin pathway; however, the role of Wnt/Î² catenin in chronic wound healing in response to PBM has not been fully defined. This review largely focuses on the role of key signalling pathways in human skin wound repair, specifically, the canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, and the effects of PBM on chronic wound healing.",-1
Impact of Activation of EGFL7 within Microenvironment of High Grade Ovarian Serous Carcinoma on Infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ Lymphocytes,"Background: It has been demonstrated that Egfl7 promotes tumor cell escape from immunity by downregulating the activation of tumor blood vessels. Aim: to analyze mRNA expression of EGFL7 within the tumor microenvironment of high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma and its association with a number of intraepithelial CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes and ICAM-1 expression. Methods: qPCR analysis of EGFL7 mRNA in cancer cells and adjacent stromal endothelium microdissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors of 59 high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma patients, was performed. Infiltration of intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD4+/CD8+) and expression of ICAM-1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and compared between tumors with different statuses of EGFL7 expression. Results: EGFL7 was expressed in cancer cells (9/59, 15.25%), endothelium (8/59, 13.56%), or both cancer cells and adjacent endothelium (4/59, 6.78%). ICAM-1 was expressed on cancer cells (47/59, 79.66%), stromal endothelium (46/59, 77.97%), or both epithelium and endothelium (40 of 59, 67.8%). EGFL7-positivity of cancer cells and endothelium was associated with lower intraepithelial inflow of CD4+ (p = 0.022 and p = 0.029, respectively) and CD8+ lymphocytes (p = 0.004 and p = 0.031, respectively) but impact neither epithelial nor endothelial ICAM-1 expression (p = 0.098 and p = 0.119, respectively). The patients' median follow-up was 23.83 months (range 1.07-78.07). Lack of prognostic significance of EGFL7-status and ICAM-1 expression was notified. Conclusion: EGFL7 is activated in the cancer cells as frequently as in the endothelium of human high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma. Activation of EGFL7 in cancer cells and/or endothelial cells could negatively impact diapedesis regardless of localization.",-1
The effect of fasting and energy restricting diets on markers of glucose and insulin controls: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Inconsistencies exist with regard to influence of fasting and energy-restricting diets on markers of glucose and insulin controls. To address these controversial, this study was conducted to determine the impact of fasting diets on fasting blood sugars (FBSs), insulin, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. A comprehensive systematic search was carried out in electronic databases, i.e., Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science through June 2019 for RCTs that investigated the impact of fasting and energy-restricting diets on circulating FBS, insulin, HOMA-IR and HbA1c levels from. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with the 95% CI were used for estimating combined effect size. The subgroup analysis was applied to specify the source of heterogeneity among articles. Pooled results from 30 eligible articles with 35 arms demonstrated a significant decrease in FBS (WMD): -3.376 mg/dl, 95% CI: -5.159, -1.594, p < 0.001), insulin (WMD: -1.288 Î¼U/ml, 95% CI: -2.385, -0.191, p = 0.021), HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.41 mg/dl, 95% CI: -0.71, -0.10, p = 0.01) levels following fasting or energy-restricting diets. Nevertheless, no significant changes were observed in serum HbA1c levels. The subgroup analyses showed that overweight or obese people with energy restricting diets and treatment duration >8 weeks had a greater reduction in FBS, insulin and HOMA-IR level compared with other subgroups. The evidence from available studies suggests that the fasting or energy-restricting diets leads to significant reductions in FBS, insulin and HOMA-IR level and has modest, but, non-significant effects on HbA1c levels.",-1
Decoding neural activity preceding balance loss during standing with a lower-limb exoskeleton using an interpretable deep learning model,"Objective:Falls are a leading cause of death in adults 65 and older. Recent efforts to restore lower-limb function in these populations have seen an increase in the use of wearable robotic systems; however, fall prevention measures in these systems require early detection of balance loss to be effective. Prior studies have investigated whether kinematic variables contain information about an impending fall, but few have examined the potential of using electroencephalography (EEG) as a fall-predicting signal and how the brain responds to avoid a fall.Approach:To address this, we decoded neural activity in a balance perturbation task while wearing an exoskeleton. We acquired EEG, electromyography (EMG), and center of pressure (COP) data from seven healthy participants during mechanical perturbations while standing. The timing of the perturbations was randomized in all trials.Main results:We found perturbation evoked potentials (PEP) components as early as 75-134 ms after the onset of the external perturbation, which preceded both the peak in EMG (â?80 ms) and the COP (â?50 ms). A convolutional neural network trained to predict balance perturbations from single-trial EEG had a mean F-score of 75.0 Â± 4.3%. Clustering GradCAM-based model explanations demonstrated that the model utilized components in the PEP and was not driven by artifacts. Additionally, dynamic functional connectivity results agreed with model explanations; the nodal connectivity measured using phase difference derivative was higher in the occipital-parietal region in the early stage of perturbations, before shifting to the parietal, motor, and back to the frontal-parietal channels. Continuous-time decoding of COP trajectories from EEG, using a gated recurrent unit model, achieved a mean Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.7 Â± 0.06.Significance:Overall, our findings suggest that EEG signals contain short-latency neural information related to an impending fall, which may be useful for developing brain-machine interface systems for fall prevention in robotic exoskeletons.",-1
[Construction of a high-throughput screening model for mitochondrial function of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata by machine learning algorithm and mechanism analysis],"A high-throughput screening machine learning model for mitochondrial function was constructed, and compounds of Aco-niti Lateralis Radix Praeparata were predicted. Deoxyaconitine with the highest score and benzoylmesaconine with the lowest score among the compounds screened by the model were selected for mitochondrial mechanism analysis. Mitochondrial function data were collected from PubChem and Tox21 databases. Random forest and gradient boosted decision tree algorithms were separately used for mo-deling, and ECFP4(extended connectivity fingerprint, up to four bonds) and Mordred descriptors were employed for training, respectively. Cross-validation test was carried out, and balanced accuracy(BA) and overall accuracy were determined to evaluate the performance of different combinations of models and obtain the optimal algorithm and hyperparameters for modeling. The data of Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata compounds in TCMSP database were collected, and after prediction and screening by the constructed high-throughput screening machine learning model, deoxyaconitine and benzoylmesaconine were selected to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species(ROS) level and protein expression of B-cell lymphoma 2(Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein(Bax) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³-coactivator 1Î±(PGC-1Î±). The results showed that the model constructed using gradient boosted decision tree+Mordred algorithm performed better, with a cross-validation BA of 0.825 and a test set accuracy of 0.811. Deoxyaconitine and benzoylmesaconine changed the ROS level(P&lt;0.001), mitochondrial membrane potential(P&lt;0.001), and protein expression of Bcl-2(P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.01) and Bax(P&lt;0.001), and deoxyaconitine increased the expression of PGC-1Î± protein(P&lt;0.01). The high-throughput screening model for mitochondrial function constructed by gradient boosted decision tree+Mordred algorithm was more accurate than that by random forest+ECFP4 algorithm, which could be used to build an algorithm model for subsequent research. Deoxyaconitine and benzoylmesaconine affected mitochondrial function. However, deoxyaconitine with higher score also affected mitochondrial biosynthesis by regulating PGC-1Î± protein.",-1
Critical Photoperiod and Its Potential to Predict Mosquito Distributions and Control Medically Important Pests,"Diapause, a period of arrested development that allows mosquitoes to survive inhospitable conditions, is triggered by short daylengths in temperate mosquitoes. Different populations of mosquitoes initiate diapause in response to a specific photoperiod, or daylength, resulting in population-specific differences in annual cycles of abundance. The photoperiod that causes approximately 50% of a population to initiate diapause is known as the critical photoperiod (CPP). The autumn daylength corresponding to the CPP in the field likely marks the day beyond which the photoperiods would trigger and maintain 50% or more diapause incidence in a population, although temperature, diet, and other factors can impact diapause initiation. In the Northern Hemisphere, northern populations of mosquitoes experience lower temperatures earlier in the year and must be triggered into diapause by longer daylengths than southern populations. CPP is genetically based, but also adapts over time responding to the population's environment. Therefore, CPP has been shown to lengthen with increasing latitude and altitude. While the positive correlation between CPP and latitude/altitude has been established in a few mosquito species, including Aedes albopictus (Skuse, Diptera: Culicidae), Aedes triseriatus, Aedes sierrensis, and Wyeomyia smithii (Coquillett, Diptera: Culicidae), we do not know when most other species initiate their seasonal responses. As several of these species transmit important diseases, characterizing the CPP of arthropod vectors could improve existing control by ensuring that surveillance efforts align with the vector's seasonally active period. Additionally, better understanding when mosquitoes and other vectors initiate diapause can reduce the frequency of chemical applications, thereby ameliorating the negative impacts to nontarget insects.",-1
Brain networks underlying vulnerability and resilience to drug addiction,"Regular drug use can lead to addiction, but not everyone who takes drugs makes this transition. How exactly drugs of abuse interact with individual vulnerability is not fully understood, nor is it clear how individuals defy the risks associated with drugs or addiction vulnerability. We used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) in 162 participants to characterize risk- and resilience-related changes in corticostriatal functional circuits in individuals exposed to stimulant drugs both with and without clinically diagnosed drug addiction, siblings of addicted individuals, and control volunteers. The likelihood of developing addiction, whether due to familial vulnerability or drug use, was associated with significant hypoconnectivity in orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortical-striatal circuits-pathways critically implicated in goal-directed decision-making. By contrast, resilience against a diagnosis of substance use disorder was associated with hyperconnectivity in two networks involving 1) the lateral prefrontal cortex and medial caudate nucleus and 2) the supplementary motor area, superior medial frontal cortex, and putamen-brain circuits respectively implicated in top-down inhibitory control and the regulation of habits. These findings point toward a predisposing vulnerability in the causation of addiction, related to impaired goal-directed actions, as well as countervailing resilience systems implicated in behavioral regulation, and may inform novel strategies for therapeutic and preventative interventions.",-1
Pleiotropic Roles for the Plasmodium berghei RNA Binding Protein UIS12 in Transmission and Oocyst Maturation,"Colonization of the mosquito host by Plasmodium parasites is achieved by sexually differentiated gametocytes. Gametocytogenesis, gamete formation and fertilization are tightly regulated processes, and translational repression is a major regulatory mechanism for stage conversion. Here, we present a characterization of a Plasmodium berghei RNA binding protein, UIS12, that contains two conserved eukaryotic RNA recognition motifs (RRM). Targeted gene deletion resulted in viable parasites that replicate normally during blood infection, but form fewer gametocytes. Upon transmission to Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, both numbers and size of midgut-associated oocysts were reduced and their development stopped at an early time point. As a consequence, no salivary gland sporozoites were formed indicative of a complete life cycle arrest in the mosquito vector. Comparative transcript profiling in mutant and wild-type infected red blood cells revealed a decrease in transcript abundance of mRNAs coding for signature gamete-, ookinete-, and oocyst-specific proteins in uis12(-) parasites. Together, our findings indicate multiple roles for UIS12 in regulation of gene expression after blood infection in good agreement with the pleiotropic defects that terminate successful sporogony and onward transmission to a new vertebrate host.",-1
"Substitution of Refined Conventional Wheat Flour with Wheat High in Resistant Starch Modulates the Intestinal Microbiota and Fecal Metabolites in Healthy Adults: A Randomized, Controlled Trial","Background:                    Resistant starch (RS) confers many health benefits, mostly through the microbial production of SCFAs, but foods containing appreciable RS are limited. High-amylose wheat (HAW) is high in RS and lowers the glycemic response of foods, but whether it can improve gastrointestinal health measures is unknown.              Objectives:                    The objective of this study was to determine whether daily consumption of HAW food products improved markers of gastrointestinal health in healthy men and women compared with similar foods made from conventional wheat.              Methods:                    Eighty healthy adults (47 women and 33 men) were enrolled in a 4-arm parallel, randomized-controlled, double-blind trial. After a 2-wk low-dietary fiber run-in period, they were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 treatment groups: low-amylose wheat (LAW)-refined (LAW-R), LAW-wholemeal (LAW-W), HAW-refined (HAW-R), and HAW-wholemeal (HAW-W) and consumed the assigned test bread (160 g/d) and biscuits (75 g/d) for 4 wk. Fecal biochemical markers were measured at baseline and 4 wk. Microbial abundance and diversity were quantified using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and perceived gut comfort by a semiquantitative questionnaire completed at baseline, 2 wk, and 4 wk.              Results:                    HAW showed similar effects on fecal output and excretion of total SCFA compared with LAW, but changes were observed in secondary measures for the refined treatment groups. At 4 wk, the HAW-R group had 38% higher fecal butyrate excretion than the LAW-R group (P < 0.05), and higher fecal SCFA-producing bacteria, Roseburia inulinivorans (P < 0.001), than at baseline. In comparison with baseline, LAW-R increased fecal p-cresol concentration, and fecal abundance of a p-cresol-producing bacterium, Clostridium from the Peptostreptococcaceae family, but both were reduced by HAW-R. Amylose level did not affect measures of fecal consistency or adversely affecting digestive comfort.              Conclusions:                    Increasing RS intake of healthy adults by substituting refined conventional wheat with refined HAW modulates fecal metabolites and microbes associated with gastrointestinal health.This trial was registered at anzctr.org.au as ACTRN12618001060235.",-1
A video-game based cognitive training for breast cancer survivors with cognitive impairment: A prospective randomized pilot trial,"Introduction:                    We investigated whether a web-based cognitive training video game is an effective approach to improve cognitive decline in combination with our standard of care for rehabilitation of breast cancer (BC) patients.              Materials and methods:                    Self-selected BC patients between 18 and 71 years old complaining of disturbing cognitive impairment were studied. The patients received access to a web-based internet video game and online cognitive assessments (Aquasnap, Cambridge, MyCQâ?. The early intervention group (n = 23) had a training program of 6 months of at least three times a week for a minimum of 60 min of game playing per week at home in addition to standard of care rehabilitation. The delayed intervention (n = 23) received standard of care for three months, followed by three months of similar MyCQ training. Outcome measures were the MyCQ (sub)scores and Activity of Daily Life (ADL), mood, subjective cognition and functional cognitive status measured by classic neuropsychological tests.              Results:                    At baseline the means for CFQ (a measure of self-reported cognitive failure), anxiety, PSQI and self-reflectiveness were beyond normal range in both groups. CFQ improved significantly better in the intervention group (p = 0.029). Combining the evolution over time in the entire population a significant improvement was seen for overall MyCQ score, level of fear, physical and emotional role limitation, and health change (all p < 0.05), but self-reflectivess deteriorated (p < 0.05)). Significant differences in the various MyCQ subtests over time were: improved speed in choice reaction time, visual memory recognition, N back 1 and 2, coding, trail making test B, improved accuracy of N back 1 and 2 (all p < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    A program of cognitive training improves cognitive functioning over time. ""Aquasnap"" has a beneficial effect on the perception of subjective cognitive functioning (CFQ) but the exact role of video gaming in this process remains uncertain.",-1
Potential metabolic resistance mechanisms to ivermectin in Anopheles gambiae: a synergist bioassay study,"Background:                    Despite remarkable success obtained with current malaria vector control strategies in the last 15 years, additional innovative measures will be needed to achieve the ambitious goals for malaria control set for 2030 by the World Health Organization (WHO). New tools will need to address insecticide resistance and residual transmission as key challenges. Endectocides such as ivermectin are drugs that kill mosquitoes which feed on treated subjects. Mass administration of ivermectin can effectively target outdoor and early biting vectors, complementing the still effective conventional tools. Although this approach has garnered attention, development of ivermectin resistance is a potential pitfall. Herein, we evaluate the potential role of xenobiotic pumps and cytochrome P450 enzymes in protecting mosquitoes against ivermectin by active efflux and metabolic detoxification, respectively.              Methods:                    We determined the lethal concentration 50 for ivermectin in colonized Anopheles gambiae; then we used chemical inhibitors and inducers of xenobiotic pumps and cytochrome P450 enzymes in combination with ivermectin to probe the mechanism of ivermectin detoxification.              Results:                    Dual inhibition of xenobiotic pumps and cytochromes was found to have a synergistic effect with ivermectin, greatly increasing mosquito mortality. Inhibition of xenobiotic pumps alone had no effect on ivermectin-induced mortality. Induction of xenobiotic pumps and cytochromes may confer partial protection from ivermectin.              Conclusion:                    There is a clear pathway for development of ivermectin resistance in malaria vectors. Detoxification mechanisms mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes are more important than xenobiotic pumps in protecting mosquitoes against ivermectin.",-1
A Rare Case Report of Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma with Pancreatic Metastasis,"Background: Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a rare but aggressive subtype of sarcoma. The majority of involvement locates in the axial skeleton. Treatment modalities include radical surgery, local radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy. However, the long-term survival outcome remains poor. Case presentation: We present the case of a 33-year-old male with a palpable chest wall mass for one year, diagnosed with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma with surgical removal. Later, he had an unusual pancreatic tail tumor as the first presentation of disease metastasis which was proven by surgical resection one year later. Conclusion: Although mesenchymal chondrosarcoma locates mainly in the axial skeletal system, extra-skeletal soft tissue or organ involvement might be seen occasionally. Active surveillance with multidisciplinary team management could significantly prolong survival outcomes.",-1
Molecular characterization of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) from the Colombian rainforest,"A few studies have carried out the taxonomic and molecular characterization of sylvatic mosquito species in Latin America, where some species have been incriminated as vectors for arboviruses and parasites transmission. The present study reports the molecular characterization of mosquito species in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, a natural ecosystem in the Northern coast of Colombia. Manual capture methods were used to collect mosquitoes, and the specimens were identified via classical taxonomy. The COI marker was used for species confirmation, and phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method, with the Kimura-2-Parameters model. Aedes serratus , Psorophora ferox , Johnbelkinia ulopus , Sabethes chloropterus , Sabethes cyaneus , Wyeomyia aporonoma , Wyeomyia pseudopecten , Wyeomyia ulocoma and Wyeomyia luteoventralis were identified. We assessed the genetic variability of mosquitoes in this area and phylogenetic reconstructions allowed the identification at the species level. Classical and molecular taxonomy demonstrated to be useful and complementary when morphological characteristics are not well preserved, or the taxonomic group is not represented in public molecular databases.",-1
High-Fat Diet-Induced Dysregulation of Immune Cells Correlates with Macrophage Phenotypes and Chronic Inflammation in Adipose Tissue,"Obesity is a complex disease associated with various metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases, and low-grade chronic inflammation. Inflammation associated with T helper 1 (Th1) immune cells is dominant in adipose tissue (AT) and exerts metabolically deleterious impacts. The precise mechanism of alteration in AT immune system and its effect on metabolic homeostasis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how a high-fat diet (HFD) alters the AT immune response and influences inflammation during obesity. HFD consumption amends the metabolic parameters, including body weight, glucose, and insulin levels. We observed increased infiltration of Th17 cells, a subset of dendritic cells (CD103+), and M1 macrophages in AT of mice fed HFD compared to those fed a normal diet (ND). In mice that were fed HFD, we also observed a reduction in regulatory T cells (Tregs) relative to the numbers of these cells in mice fed ND. Corresponding with this, mice in the HFD group exhibited higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines than those in the ND group. We also observed alterations in signaling pathways, including increased protein expression of IRF3, TGFÎ²1, and mRNA expression of IL-6, KLF4, and STAT3 in the AT of the mice fed HFD as compared to those fed ND. Further, HFD-fed mice exhibited decreased protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-Î³) compared to mice fed ND, suggesting that PPAR-Î³ functions as a negative regulator of Th17 cell differentiation. These results suggest that HFD induces increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and key immune cells, including Th17, M1 macrophages, and CD103+ dendritic cells, and reduces levels of PPAR-Î³ and Tregs to sustain AT inflammation. This study supports the notion that dysregulation of Th17/Tregs, which polarizes macrophages towards M1 phenotypes in part through TGFÎ²1-IRF3-STAT3 and negatively regulates PPAR-Î³ mediated pathways, results in AT inflammation during obesity.",-1
"Human Behavior, Livelihood, and Malaria Transmission in Two Sites of Papua New Guinea","Background:                    Malaria transmission is currently resurging in Papua New Guinea (PNG). In addition to intervention coverage, social and cultural factors influence changes in epidemiology of malaria in PNG. This study aimed to better understand the role of human behavior in relation to current malaria control efforts.              Methods:                    A mixed-method design was used in 2 sites in PNG. In-depth interviews, focus group discussions, cross-sectional malaria indicator survey, and population census were implemented.              Results:                    We identified 7 population groups based on demographics and behavioral patterns with potential relevance to Anopheles exposure. People spend a substantial amount of time outdoors or in semiopen structures. Between 4 pm and 8 am, all types of activities across all groups in both study sites may be exposing individuals to mosquito bites; sleeping under a long-lasting insecticidal net was the exception. The later in the night, the more outdoor presence was concentrated in adult men.              Conclusions:                    Our findings highlight the potential of outdoor exposure to hamper malaria control as people spend a remarkable amount of time outdoors without protection from mosquitoes. To prevent ongoing transmission, targeting of groups, places, and activities with complementary interventions should consider setting-specific human behaviors in addition to epidemiological and entomological data.",-1
"Dioscin Alleviates Cisplatin-Induced Mucositis in Rats by Modulating Gut Microbiota, Enhancing Intestinal Barrier Function and Attenuating TLR4/NF-ÎºB Signaling Cascade","Cisplatin-based chemotherapy causes intestinal mucositis, which causes patients immense suffering and hinders the process of cancer treatment. Dioscin is a natural steroid saponin that exhibits strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Herein, we investigate the protective effect of dioscin on cisplatin induced mucositis in rats from the perspective of gut microbiota and intestinal barrier. We established a rat model of intestinal mucositis by tail vein injection of cisplatin, and concurrently treated with dioscin oral administration. Parameters, such as body weight, diarrheal incidence, and D-Lactate levels, were assessed in order to evaluate the effects of dioscin on intestinal mucositis in rats. Furthermore, biological samples were collected for microscopic gut microbiota, intestinal integrity, and immune inflammation analyses to elucidate the protective mechanisms of dioscin on intestinal mucositis. The results revealed that administration of dioscin significantly attenuated clinical manifestations, histological injury and inflammation in mucositis rats. Besides this, dioscin markedly inhibited the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by cisplatin. Meanwhile, dioscin partially alleviated junctions between ileum epithelial cells and increased mucus secretion. Moreover, dioscin effectively inhibited the TLR4-MyD88-NF-ÎºB signal transduction pathway and reduced the secretion of subsequent inflammatory mediators. These results suggested that dioscin effectively attenuated cisplatin-induced mucositis in part by modulating the gut microflora profile, maintaining ileum integrity and inhibiting the inflammatory response through the TLR4-MyD88-NF-ÎºB pathway.",-1
Inferring Causality from Noninvasive Brain Stimulation in Cognitive Neuroscience,"Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation, are advocated as measures to enable causal inference in cognitive neuroscience experiments. Transcending the limitations of purely correlative neuroimaging measures and experimental sensory stimulation, they allow to experimentally manipulate brain activity and study its consequences for perception, cognition, and eventually, behavior. Although this is true in principle, particular caution is advised when interpreting brain stimulation experiments in a causal manner. Research hypotheses are often oversimplified, disregarding the underlying (implicitly assumed) complex chain of causation, namely, that the stimulation technique has to generate an electric field in the brain tissue, which then evokes or modulates neuronal activity both locally in the target region and in connected remote sites of the network, which in consequence affects the cognitive function of interest and eventually results in a change of the behavioral measure. Importantly, every link in this causal chain of effects can be confounded by several factors that have to be experimentally eliminated or controlled to attribute the observed results to their assumed cause. This is complicated by the fact that many of the mediating and confounding variables are not directly observable and dose-response relationships are often nonlinear. We will walk the reader through the chain of causation for a generic cognitive neuroscience NIBS study, discuss possible confounds, and advise appropriate control conditions. If crucial assumptions are explicitly tested (where possible) and confounds are experimentally well controlled, NIBS can indeed reveal cause-effect relationships in cognitive neuroscience studies.",-1
Factors contributing to continuity and discontinuity in child psychopathology from infancy to childhood: An explorative study,"This study examined the psychopathology and socioemotional functioning of school-aged children treated during infancy and a comparison group of children without symptoms or treatment history. Our goal was to identify the factors associated with the continuity of psychopathology from infancy to childhood. The sample comprised 54 Israeli children, 30 with treatment history as infants in an infant mental health clinic and 24 with no treatment history. A 2 Ã 2 study design, with treatment history (treated/non-treated) and current psychiatric diagnosis (diagnosed vs. non-diagnosed), was used and group differences in children's psychopathology (Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA)), socioemotional functioning (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition (VABS-II)), maternal stress (Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI/SF)) and psychopathology (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)), family functioning (Family Assessment Device (FAD)), and mother-child relational patterns (Coding Interactive Behavior (CIB)) were assessed. We found no differences between the previously treated and non-treated groups in the rate of given Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis. However, there was an interactive effect of treatment history Ã current psychiatric diagnosis, with the highest level of maternal stress in mothers of children exhibiting both early and late emotional and/or behavioral symptoms. Implications of these findings for identifying children and families at risk for continued child psychopathology and the importance of early parent-child psychotherapy interventions are discussed.",-1
Stable high-density and maternally inherited Wolbachia infections in Anopheles moucheti and Anopheles demeilloni mosquitoes,"Wolbachia, a widespread bacterium that can reduce pathogen transmission in mosquitoes, has recently been reported to be present in Anopheles (An.) species. In wild populations of the An. gambiae complex, the primary vectors of Plasmodium malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wolbachia DNA sequences at low density and infection frequencies have been detected. As the majority of studies have used highly sensitive nested PCR as the only method of detection, more robust evidence is required to determine whether Wolbachia strains are established as endosymbionts in Anopheles species. Here, we describe high-density Wolbachia infections in geographically diverse populations of An. moucheti and An. demeilloni. Fluorescent in situ hybridization localized a heavy infection in the ovaries of An. moucheti, and maternal transmission was observed. Genome sequencing of both Wolbachia strains obtained genome depths and coverages comparable to those of other known infections. Notably, homologs of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor (cif) genes were present, indicating that these strains possess the capacity to induce the cytoplasmic incompatibility phenotype, which allows Wolbachia to spread through host populations. These strains should be further investigated as candidates for use in Wolbachia biocontrol strategies in Anopheles aiming to reduce the transmission of malaria.",-1
Chitosan oligosaccharide mitigates kidney injury in prediabetic rats by improving intestinal barrier and renal autophagy,"Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) not only increases the risk of metabolic syndrome but also initiates kidney injury. Lipid accumulation-induced systemic low-grade inflammation is an upstream mechanism of kidney injury associated with prediabetes. Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) provides potent anti-obesity effects through several mechanisms including fecal lipid excretion. In this study, we investigated the effects of COS on the prevention of obesity-related complications and its ability to confer renoprotection in a prediabetic model. Rats fed on a HFD developed obesity, glucose intolerance and kidney dysfunction. COS intervention successfully ameliorated these conditions (p < 0.05) by attenuating intestinal lipid absorption and the renal inflammation-autophagy-apoptosis axis. A novel anti-inflammatory effect of COS had been demonstrated by the strengthening of intestinal barrier integrity via calcium-sensing receptor (p < 0.05). The use of COS as a supplement may be useful in reducing prediabetic complications especially renal injury and the risk of type 2 diabetes.",-1
MicroRNA miR-27a-3p accelerates cardiac hypertrophy by targeting neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1,"MiRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of target genes. Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs are implicated in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms how these miRNAs regulate cardiac hypertrophy is useful for diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. In this study, to investigate the effect of miR-27a-3p, we established an in vitro cardiac hypertrophy model by treating H9c2 cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II (Ang II) and an in vivo model through the chronic infusion of Ang II into mice. As revealed by our experimental results, miR-27a-3p expression was significantly increased in clinical samples, animal and cell models of cardiac hypertrophy. Inhibiting miR-27a-3p mitigated cardiac hypertrophy phenotype induced by Ang II. Additionally, our work identified NOVA1 (neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1) as a downstream target of miR-27a-3p. miR-27a-3p overexpression reduced NOVA1 protein level and mRNA expression. Consistently, NOVA1 silencing promoted cardiac hypertrophy phenotype induced by Ang II. In summary, these results suggest that the upregulation of miR-27a-3p may serve as a diagnostic factor for cardiac hypertrophy, and miR-27a-3p upregulation promotes cardiac hypertrophy by targeting NOVA1.",-1
Psychosocial Predictors of Acute and Chronic Pain in Adolescents Undergoing Major Musculoskeletal Surgery,"Acute and chronic pain delay recovery and impair outcomes after major pediatric surgery. Understanding unique risk factors for acute and chronic pain is critical to developing effective treatments for youth at risk. We aimed to identify adolescent and family psychosocial predictors of acute and chronic postsurgical pain after major surgery in adolescents. Participants included 119 youth age 10 to 18 years (Mage = 14.9; 78.2% white) undergoing major musculoskeletal surgery and their parents. Participants completed presurgery baseline questionnaires, with youth reporting on baseline pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia and sleep quality, and parents reporting on parental catastrophizing and family functioning. At baseline, 2-week, and 4-month postsurgery, youth completed 7 days of daily pain diaries and reported on health-related quality of life. Sequential logistic regression models examined presurgery predictors of acute and chronic postsurgical pain, defined as significant pain with impairment in health-related quality of life. Acute pain was experienced by 27.2% of youth at 2 weeks, while 19.8% of youth met criteria for chronic pain at 4 months. Baseline pain predicted acute pain (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-2.90), while depressive symptoms (OR = 1.22; 95%CI = 1.01-1.47), and sleep quality (OR = 0.26; 95%CI = 0.08-0.83) predicted chronic pain. Tailored interventions need to be developed and incorporated into perioperative care to address risk factors for acute and chronic pain. PERSPECTIVE: Longitudinal results demonstrate adolescents' presurgery pain severity predicts acute postsurgical pain, while depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality predict chronic postsurgical pain. Tailored interventions should address separate risk factors for acute and chronic pain after adolescent surgery.",-1
TcdB of Clostridioides difficile Mediates RAS-Dependent Necrosis in Epithelial Cells,"A Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common nosocomial infection worldwide. The main virulence factors of pathogenic C. difficile are TcdA and TcdB, which inhibit small Rho-GTPases. The inhibition of small Rho-GTPases leads to the so-called cytopathic effect, a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, an impairment of the colon epithelium barrier function and inflammation. Additionally, TcdB induces a necrotic cell death termed pyknosis in vitro independently from its glucosyltransferases, which are characterized by chromatin condensation and ROS production. To understand the underlying mechanism of this pyknotic effect, we conducted a large-scale phosphoproteomic study. We included the analysis of alterations in the phosphoproteome after treatment with TcdA, which was investigated for the first time. TcdA exhibited no glucosyltransferase-independent necrotic effect and was, thus, a good control to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the glucosyltransferase-independent effect of TcdB. We found RAS to be a central upstream regulator of the glucosyltransferase-independent effect of TcdB. The inhibition of RAS led to a 68% reduction in necrosis. Further analysis revealed apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) as a possible crucial factor of CDI-induced inflammation in vivo.",-1
Dirofilaria immitis infection in the Pelagie archipelago: The southernmost hyperendemic focus in Europe,"Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are mosquito-borne filarioids of zoonotic concern, which primarily cause canine heartworm disease (HWD) and subcutaneous dirofilariosis, respectively. The geographical distribution of these nematodes is constantly changing, due to many factors such as the colonization by new invasive mosquito species, the increased movement of animals and the absence of chemoprophylactic strategies in non-endemic regions. Although HWD has always been considered endemic in northern Italy, an increase in the prevalence of this disease has been recorded in the last decades in central and southern regions. We describe the southernmost hyperendemic European focus of heartworm disease in the Pelagie archipelagos. From June to November 2020, 157 dogs and 46 cats were sampled in Linosa and Lampedusa islands for the detection of Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens by modified Knott's, rapid antigen and molecular tests. Mosquitoes were collected using CDC light and BG sentinel-2 traps and aspirators, and tested for host blood meal and Dirofilaria spp. DNA. Out of 56 dogs in Linosa and 101 in Lampedusa, 33 (i.e. 58.9%) and 8 (i.e. 7.9%) were positive to D. immitis and D. repens, respectively. Three cats scored positive to D. immitis (i.e. 17.6%) in Linosa. Six mosquito species were identified, and the abdomen of a non-engorged Aedes albopictus was positive for D. immitis and human DNA. The results suggest that D. immitis infection could spread to new previously non-endemic territories in southern Europe, representing a real threat to animal and human health.",-1
Dynamically Bioresponsive DNA Hydrogel Incorporated with Dual-Functional Stem Cells from Apical Papilla-Derived Exosomes Promotes Diabetic Bone Regeneration,"The regeneration of bone defects in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is remarkably impaired by hyperglycemia and over-expressed proinflammatory cytokines, proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs), etc. In view of the fact that exosomes represent a promising nanomaterial, herein, we reported the excellent capacity of stem cells from apical papilla-derived exosomes (SCAP-Exo) to facilitate angiogenesis and osteogenesis whether in normal or diabetic conditions in vitro. Then, a bioresponsive polyethylene glycol (PEG)/DNA hybrid hydrogel was developed to support a controllable release of SCAP-Exo for diabetic bone defects. This system could be triggered by the elevated pathological cue (MMP-9) in response to the dynamic diabetic microenvironment. It was further confirmed that the administration of the injectable SCAP-Exo-loaded PEG/DNA hybrid hydrogel into the mandibular bone defect of diabetic rats demonstrated a great therapeutic effect on promoting vascularized bone regeneration. In addition, the miRNA sequencing suggested that the mechanism of dual-functional SCAP-Exo might be related to highly expressed miRNA-126-5p and miRNA-150-5p. Consequently, our study provides valuable insights into the design of promising bioresponsive exosome-delivery systems to improve bone regeneration in diabetic patients.",-1
Atherosclerosis amelioration by allicin in raw garlic through gut microbiota and trimethylamine-N-oxide modulation,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is strongly associated with the gut microbiota and its metabolites, including trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), formed from metaorganismal metabolism of Ê-carnitine. Raw garlic juice, with allicin as its primary compound, exhibits considerable effects on the gut microbiota. This study validated the benefits of raw garlic juice against CVD risk via modulation of the gut microbiota and its metabolites. Allicin supplementation significantly decreased serum TMAO in Ê-carnitine-fed C57BL/6 J mice, reduced aortic lesions, and altered the fecal microbiota in carnitine-induced, atherosclerosis-prone, apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. In human subjects exhibiting high-TMAO production, raw garlic juice intake for a week reduced TMAO formation, improved gut microbial diversity, and increased the relative abundances of beneficial bacteria. In in vitro and ex vivo studies, raw garlic juice and allicin inhibited Î³-butyrobetaine (Î³BB) and trimethylamine production by the gut microbiota. Thus, raw garlic juice and allicin can potentially prevent cardiovascular disease by decreasing TMAO production via gut microbiota modulation.",-1
Hydrocele with Paratesticular Liposarcoma,"Paratesticular liposarcoma (PLS) is a rare type of genitourinary malignancy in the spermatic cord presenting as scrotal swelling. In this case study, we report an 82-year male who presented with prolonged left scrotal swelling and pain that did not respond to analgesic treatment for one week. His ultrasound confirmed increased fluid content in the left scrotal compartment in the form of septated hydrocele, and hydrocelectomy was planned. During the operation, infected fluid was drained. The testicle and surrounding tissues were infected; hence, left orchiectomy was performed. The pathological examination revealed a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report of liposarcoma of the spermatic cord with hydrocele in the literature. Key Words: Liposarcoma, Spermatic cord, Scrotal swelling, Hydrocele.",-1
An Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Nickel(II)-Polypyridyl Complex Containing Flufenamic Acid,"Apoptosis resistance is inherent to stem cell-like populations within tumours and is one of the major reasons for chemotherapy failures in the clinic. Necroptosis is a non-apoptotic mode of programmed cell death that could help bypass apoptosis resistance. Here we report the synthesis, characterisation, biophysical properties, and anti-osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a new nickel(II) complex bearing 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline and two flufenamic acid moieties, 1. The nickel(II) complex 1 is stable in both DMSO and cell media. The nickel(II) complex 1 kills bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs grown in monolayer cultures and osteospheres grown in three-dimensional cultures within the micromolar range. Remarkably, 1 exhibits higher potency towards osteospheres than the metal-based drugs used in current osteosarcoma treatment regimens, cisplatin and carboplatin, and an established anti-cancer stem cell agent, salinomycin (up to 7.7-fold). Cytotoxicity studies in the presence of prostaglandin E2 suggest that 1 kills OSCs in a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) dependent manner. Furthermore, the potency of 1 towards OSCs decreased significantly upon co-treatment with necrostatin-1 or dabrafenib, well-known necroptosis inhibitors, implying that 1 induces necroptosis in OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 1 is the first compound to implicate both COX-2 and necroptosis in its mechanism of action in OSCs.",-1
Comparing sterile male releases and other methods for integrated control of the tiger mosquito in temperate and tropical climates,"The expansion of mosquito species worldwide is creating a powerful network for the spread of arboviruses. In addition to the destruction of breeding sites (prevention) and mass trapping, methods based on the sterile insect technique (SIT), the autodissemination of pyriproxyfen (ADT), and a fusion of elements from both of these known as boosted SIT (BSIT), are being developed to meet the urgent need for effective vector control. However, the comparative potential of these methods has yet to be explored in different environments. This is needed to propose and integrate informed guidelines into sustainable mosquito management plans. We extended a weather-dependent model of Aedes albopictus population dynamics to assess the effectiveness of these different vector control methods, alone or in combination, in a tropical (Reunion island, southwest Indian Ocean) and a temperate (Montpellier area, southern France) climate. Our results confirm the potential efficiency of SIT in temperate climates when performed early in the year (mid-March for northern hemisphere). In such a climate, the timing of the vector control action was the key factor in its success. In tropical climates, the potential of the combination of methods becomes more relevant. BSIT and the combination of ADT with SIT were twice as effective compared to the use of SIT alone.",-1
Isolated Spleen Metastases of Endometrial Cancer: A Case Report,"Background:                    Isolated splenic metastases from endometrial cancer, which is a relatively common malignancy, are extremely rare findings; to date, only 14 cases have been reported in the literature.              Case summary:                    We report a patient with isolated splenic metastases of endometrial cancer 3 years after radical surgery of the primary tumor. The patient was successfully treated by splenectomy and six cycles of paclitaxel. Fifty months after splenectomy, she was alive and well, and with no evidence of disease.              Conclusion:                    Isolated spleen metastasis of endometrial cancer is very rare. Radical surgery and adjuvant therapy may offer excellent long-term survival.",-1
"First record of the West Nile virus bridge vector Culex modestus Ficalbi (Diptera: Culicidae) in Belgium, validated by DNA barcoding","A thorough knowledge of the presence and spatio-temporal distribution patterns of vector species are pivotal to assess the risk of mosquito-borne diseases in Europe. In 2018, a Culex larva was collected during routine monitoring activities to intercept exotic Aedes mosquito species in the port of Antwerp (Kallo, Belgium). The larva, collected from a pond in mid-September, was morphologically identified as Culex modestus, and this identification was subsequently confirmed by COI barcoding. It is the first confirmed record of this West Nile virus bridge vector in Belgium. The present study also demonstrates the value of DNA-based identification techniques to validate the presence of potential vector species.",-1
"Insecticide resistance in dengue vectors from hotspots in Selangor, Malaysia","Background:                    In Malaysia, dengue remains a top priority disease and usage of insecticides is the main method for dengue vector control. Limited baseline insecticide resistance data in dengue hotspots has prompted us to conduct this study. The present study reports the use of a map on the insecticide susceptibility status of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus to provide a quick visualization and overview of the distribution of insecticide resistance.              Method and results:                    The insecticide resistance status of Aedes populations collected from 24 dengue hotspot areas from the period of December 2018 until June 2019 was proactively monitored using the World Health Organization standard protocol for adult and larval susceptibility testing was conducted, together with elucidation of the mechanisms involved in observed resistance. For resistance monitoring, susceptibility to three adulticides (permethrin, deltamethrin, and malathion) was tested, as well as susceptibility to the larvicide, temephos. Data showed significant resistance to both deltamethrin and permethrin (pyrethroid insecticides), and to malathion (organophosphate insecticide) in all sampled Aedes aegypti populations, while variable resistance patterns were found in the sampled Aedes albopictus populations. Temephos resistance was observed when larvae were tested using the diagnostic dosage of 0.012mg/L but not at the operational dosage of 1mg/L for both species.              Conclusion:                    The present study highlights evidence of a potential threat to the effectiveness of insecticides currently used in dengue vector control, and the urgent requirement for insecticide resistance management to be integrated into the National Dengue Control Program.",-1
Nuanxinkang protects against ischemia/reperfusion-induced heart failure through regulating IKKÎ²/IÎºBÎ±/NF-ÎºB-mediated macrophage polarization,"Background:                    Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Nuanxinkang (NXK) is an effective Chinese herbal formula used in treating HF, but its underlying potential mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.              Purpose:                    To explore the protective activities of NXK in ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced HF through modulating the ratio of proinflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophage populations and leading to the alleviation of inflammation.              Materials and methods:                    In vivo, mice were subjected to myocardial IR to generate HF mouse models. Mice in the NXK group were treated with NXK for 28 days. Cardiac function was detected by echocardiography. Major lesions on mouse hearts were determined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Masson staining, and TUNEL staining. Inflammatory cytokines were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and qPCR examination. Flow cytometric analyses and qPCR examination were utilized for monitoring the temporal dynamics of macrophage infiltration following IR. In vitro, two polarized models were established by stimulating RAW264.7 cells with 200 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 20 ng/ml interleukin-4 (IL-4). The RAW264.7 cells with nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) overexpression was generated by transient transfection of NF-ÎºB plasmids, and NXK intervention was conducted on this cell model to further clarify the involvement of NF-ÎºB signaling in the NXK-mediated HF process.              Results:                    In the present study, NXK was found to significantly contribute the cardiac function and ameliorate cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis after myocardial IR injury in vivo, which may be partially due to a decrease in inflammation. We therefore hypothesized that NXK reduced inflammatory damage by modulating subtypes of macrophages. And the results demonstrated that the percentage of proinflammatory macrophages infiltrated in the post-IR period was reduced with NXK treatment, and thereby blunting the wave of proinflammatory response and shifting the peak of the anti-inflammatory macrophage-mediated wound healing process towards an earlier time point. The further investigation showed that macrophage polarization was mediated by NXK through inhibiting the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of NF-ÎºB. Besides, the phosphorylated IKKÎ² and IÎºBÎ±, upstream mediators of the NF-ÎºB pathway, also decreased by NXK. Moreover, the overexpression of NF-ÎºB partially reversed the NXK-induced favorable activities; and successfully compensated the suppressive effect on inflammation and the phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB.              Conclusion:                    In conclude, our results demonstrated that NXK induced the cardioprotective effects against IR injury through a regulatory axis of IKKÎ²/IÎºBÎ±/NF-ÎºB-mediated macrophage polarization. The information gained from this study provide a possible natural strategy for anti-inflammatory treatment of HF.",-1
Impact of provision of optimum diabetes care on the safety of fasting in Ramadan in adult and adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus,"Background:                    All diabetes and Ramadan guidelines advice against fasting for people with type 1 diabetes, however, many insist on fasting. Consequently, this causes a challenge due to the risk of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycemia Â± diabetic ketoacidosis.              Aim:                    To assess the impact of optimum care, which includes Ramadan-focused education, flash glucose monitoring, dietary advice and treatment adjustment on the safety of Ramadan fasting in people with type 1 diabetes.              Methods:                    Thirty persons with type 1 diabetes who insisted to fast during Ramadan were recruited to the study. At pre-Ramadan visit, all patients received Ramadan focused education and Freestyle Libre (FSL) sensor insertion and training. Patients used the sensor for 6 weeks (pre-Ramadan and during Ramadan). The physical and biological parameters were collected 2-4 weeks before and after Ramadan.              Results:                    22 patients on basal bolus insulin and 2 on an insulin pump had FSL data. Average number of days fasted were 24. Learning benefits was reported by 95% of patients following pre-Ramadan educational session. There was no clinically significant change in physical and/or biological data between pre and post-Ramadan. 63% reported making insulin dose adjustments in Ramadan. Flash glucose monitoring data showed 46.7% of patients had more than 10 hypoglycemic episodes in the 2 weeks prior to Ramadan compared to 29.2% during Ramadan. However, none of the data were statistically significant apart from HbA1c which reduced from prior to RamadanHbA1c of 8.2% to 7.9% post Ramadan (P 0.010). There was one DKA on 2nd day of Ramadan, reported due to missing insulin dose to avoid hypoglycemia.              Conclusion:                    Optimal care of selective patients with type 1 diabetes with a low complication rate may allow Ramadan fasting with improvement in glycemic control and without an increase in hypoglycemia, biometric or metabolic parameters. Larger, randomized controlled trials are required to be able to generalize this as a recommendation.",-1
Low levels of classical BSE infectivity in rendered fat tissue,"BSE infectivity in mesentery fat is most likely associated with embedded nervous tissue. To prove this mesentery containing celiac ganglion was taken from oral BSE infected cattle in different stages of the disease and from one control animal. Fat was rendered according to standard tallow production methods and the prion infectivity therein analysed in transgenic mouse bioassay. Rendered fat of the clinical animal revealed low infectivity levels, whereas preclinical and control animals remained negative. This study, although not representative, provides a proof of principle, indicating the potential contamination of melted mesenteric fat by embedded nervous structures during standard tallow production.",-1
Influence of visceral obesity on the secretion of adipokines with epicardial adipocytes in patients with coronary heart disease,"Aim:                    To study adipokine-cytokine profile of epicardial adipocytes (EAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) in conjunction with the area of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), biochemical and clinical characteristics of patients with coronary heart disease.              Materials and methods:                    Examined 84 patients (70 men and 14 women) with coronary artery disease. In fact the presence of visceral obesity (VO) the patients were divided into two groups. Patients VO the sampling of adipocytes of EAT and SAT, with subsequent cultivation and evaluation of adipokine and provospalitelna activity. Carried out the determination of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, adipokine and pro-inflammatory status in the blood serum.              Results:                    It was found that adipokine-cytokine profile of adipocytes of EAT and SAT differ. Adipocytes art of the disease on the background characterized by an increase IL-1, TNF-Î±, leptin-adiponectin relationships and a decrease in the content of protective factors: adiponectin and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. While the SAT adipocytes was characterized by a decrease in the concentration of soluble receptor for leptin and the more pronounced leptinresistance, and the increase in proinflammatory cytokines was offset by the increase in the concentration of IL-10. The presence associated with multi-vessel coronary bed lesion, multifocal atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, an imbalance of adipokines and markers of inflammation. So the value of the square VAT determined higher concentrations of leptin, TNF-Î± in adipocytes and serum, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and a lower content of soluble receptor for leptin.              Conclusion:                    Thus, the disease on the background of the status of the adipocytes of EAT characterized as a &quot;metabolic inflammation&quot;, and may indicate the direct involvement of adipocytes in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, due to the formation of adipokine imbalance and the activation of proinflammatory reactions.",-1
Zika virus outbreak in Brazil-Lessons learned and perspectives for a safe and effective vaccine,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging pathogen of public health concern, associated with a dramatic burden in places where the virus caused outbreaks between 2015 and 2017. In the Americas, the ZIKV was first reported in Brazil and rapidly spread through the Americas. Since its first report, a number of studies have been published as we continue to learn, not only about modes of transmission, but also clinical manifestations, risk of congenital anomalies, including microcephaly and neurological malformations in fetuses born from mothers infected during pregnancy. Interventions to reduce the burden of ZIKV infection are restricted to mosquito control, and for Aedes spp mosquitoes the strategies implemented to that end proved to be unsuccessful so far. Hence the lessons we can learn following the ZIKV epidemics become of paramount importance in the development of drug treatments and in search for a vaccine.",-1
Admission fasting plasma glucose is associated with in-hospital outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome and diabetes: findings from the improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China - Acute Coronary Syndrome (CCC-ACS) project,"Background:                    The discrepancy between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in clinical practice may be related to factors such as acute stress, renal dysfunction, and anemia, and its relationship with in-hospital outcomes is uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the type of discrepancy between HbA1c and FPG and in-hospital outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and diabetes.              Methods:                    The Improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China - Acute Coronary Syndrome (CCC-ACS) project is a national, hospital-based quality improvement project with an ongoing database. Patients with ACS, diabetes and complete HbA1c and FPG values at admission were included. The consistent group included patients with HbA1c < 6.5% and FPG < 7.0 mmol/L or HbA1c â?6.5% and FPG â?7.0 mmol/L. The discrepancy group included patients with HbA1c â?6.5% and FPG < 7.0 mmol/L (increased HbA1c group) or HbA1c < 6.5% and FPG â?7.0 mmol/L (increased FBG group).              Results:                    A total of 7762 patients were included in this study. The numbers of patients in the consistent and discrepancy groups were 5490 and 2272 respectively. In the discrepancy group, increased HbA1c accounted for 77.5% of discrepancies, and increased FPG accounted for 22.5% of discrepancies. After adjusting for confounders, patients in the increased FPG group had a 1.6-fold increased risk of heart failure (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.08-2.44), a 1.6-fold increased risk of composite cardiovascular death and heart failure (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09-2.43), and a 1.6-fold increased risk of composite major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and heart failure (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.08-2.24) compared to patients in the increased HbA1c group.              Conclusions:                    Patients with an increased FPG but normal HbA1c had a higher risk of in-hospital adverse outcomes than those with increased HbA1c but normal FPG. This result may indicate that when HbA1c and FPG are inconsistent in patients with ACS and diabetes, the increased FPG that may be caused by stress hyperglycemia may have a more substantial adverse effect than increased HbA1c, which may be caused by chronic hyperglycemia. These high-risk patients should be given more attention and closer monitoring in clinical practice.              Trial registry:                    Clinicaltrial.gov , NCT02306616 .

Isolation of a Human Betaretrovirus from Patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis,"A human betaretrovirus (HBRV) has been linked with the autoimmune liver disease, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), and various cancers, including breast cancer and lymphoma. HBRV is closely related to the mouse mammary tumor virus, and represents the only exogenous betaretrovirus characterized in humans to date. Evidence of infection in patients with PBC has been demonstrated through the identification of proviral integration sites in lymphoid tissue, the major reservoir of infection, as well as biliary epithelium, which is the site of the disease process. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that patients with PBC harbor a transmissible betaretrovirus by co-cultivation of PBC patients' lymph node homogenates with the HS578T breast cancer line. Because of the low level of HBRV replication, betaretrovirus producing cells were subcloned to optimize viral isolation and production. Evidence of infection was provided by electron microscopy, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, cloning of the HBRV proviral genome and demonstration of more than 3400 integration sites. Further evidence of viral transmissibility was demonstrated by infection of biliary epithelial cells. While HBRV did not show a preference for integration proximal to specific genomic features, analyses of common insertion sites revealed evidence of integration proximal to cancer associated genes. These studies demonstrate the isolation of HBRV with features similar to mouse mammary tumor virus and confirm that patients with PBC display evidence of a transmissible viral infection.",-1
Systematic TB screening using WHO radiograph categorisation and care outcomes,"BACKGROUND: An appropriate screening approach and quality care are crucial for TB programmes in prisons. This study assessed crude TB prevalence, accuracy of the screening methods and treatment outcomes in a Thai prison.METHOD: This was a retrospective analysis of findings from a mass CXR screening conducted among incarcerated people in July 2017. Digital radiographs were forwarded to a chest physician to read and classify in six categories using WHO categorisation. CXR with significant Categories 3 (no active TB), 4 (not TB), 5 (TB) and 6 (unclassified) abnormalities were eligible for sputum microscopy and Xpert testing. A screening questionnaire locally known as TB-P1 was used for case management. Patients with TB received care in the prison.RESULTS: Of 2,382 prisoners screened, 6.3% had CXR Categories 3-6. Crude prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB was 1,133/100,000 (95% CI 748.3-1644.9). The screeningÂ´s sensitivity was 96.3% based on CXR Category 5 and 22.2% using TB-P1. Treatment success rates in drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB patients were respectively 66.7% and 33.3%.CONCLUSION: The WHO radiograph categorisation could be used to screen for TB in the field and may be applied in artificial intelligence for interpreting CXR; screening questionnaires are not effective in prison environments. Nonetheless, low treatment success rates remained a challenge.",-1
Dissecting the Genome for Drug Response Prediction,"The prediction of the cancer cell lines sensitivity to a specific treatment is one of the current challenges in precision medicine. With omics and pharmacogenomics data being available for over 1000 cancer cell lines, several machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been proposed for drug sensitivity prediction. However, deciding which omics data to use and which computational methods can efficiently incorporate data from different sources is the challenge which several research groups are working on. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the representative computational methods that have been developed in the last 2 years on three public datasets: COSMIC, CCLE, NCI-60. These methods aim to improve the prediction of the cancer cell lines sensitivity to a given treatment by incorporating drug's chemical information in the input or using a priori feature selection. Finally, we discuss the latest published method which aims to improve the prediction of clinical drug response of real patients starting from cancer cell line molecular profiles.",-1
"LINC00982 Inhibits the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Breast Cancer Cells Through the miR-765/DPF3 Axis","Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most frequently occurring malignant tumors in female adults. The long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 00982 (LINC00982) has been regarded as a cancer suppressor in several human cancers. However, the function and the underlying mechanisms of LINC00982 have not been studied in BC. The present study found that LINC00982 was significantly downregulated in BC tumor tissues, and the low LINC00982 level predicts a poor prognosis of BC. Through the overexpression and suppression of LINC00982 in two BC cell lines, we found that LINC00982 could inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by suppressing the activity of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signal pathway. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay has been used to verify that LINC00982 functions as a molecular sponge for miR-765, which could target DPF3. The relative expression of miR-765 decreased with LINC00982 overexpressing, and DPF3 increased at the same time. In addition, the suppression of cell malignant phenotype caused by overexpression of LINC00982 can be reversed by inhibition of DPF3. To verify the function of LINC00982 in vivo, the BC cells were implanted in nude mice and the results suggested the tumor growth and malignant phenotype were suppressed by LINC00982. In this study, we prove that LINC00982 regulates the growth and development of BC through STAT3/NF-ÎºB signal pathway, mediated by the miR-765/DPF3 axis. LINC00982 may function as a target molecule to take part in the prognosis and therapy of BC.",-1
Reappraisal of the optimal fasting time for insulin tolerance tests in mice,"Objective:                    Most studies routinely use overnight or 6 h of fasting before testing metabolic glucose homeostasis in mice. Other studies used empirically shorter fasting times (<6 h). We attempted to determine the shortest fasting time required for optimal insulin responsiveness while minimizing metabolic stress.              Methods:                    A course of fasting for up to 24 h (0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h) was conducted in C57Bl/6J male mice. Body weight, metabolic parameters, and insulin tolerance were measured in each experimental group. The organs were collected at the same time on separate occasions and glycogen and metabolic gene expression were measured in the liver and skeletal muscle.              Results:                    Our data show that blood glucose levels do not significantly change during a 6 h fast, while plasma insulin levels decrease to similar levels between 2 h and 6 h of fasting. During overnight (12 h) and 24 h fasts, a robust decrease in blood glucose and plasma insulin was observed along with a profound depletion in liver glycogen content. Insulin tolerance was comparable between baseline and 6 h fasts while 4 h and 6 h fasts were associated with a greater depletion of liver glycogen than 2 h fasts, impacting the glucose counter-regulatory response. Fasting induced progressive weight loss that was attenuated at thermoneutrality. Fasting longer than 4 h induced major body weight loss (>5%) and significant changes in catabolic gene expression in the liver and skeletal muscle.              Conclusion:                    Collectively, these data suggest that 2 h of fasting appears optimal for the assessment of insulin tolerance in mice as this duration minimizes major metabolic stress and weight loss.",-1
Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Electrocardiogram for Atrial Fibrillation Identifies Cognitive Decline Risk and Cerebral Infarcts,"Objective:                    To investigate whether artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) assessment of atrial fibrillation (AF) risk predicts cognitive decline and cerebral infarcts.              Patients and methods:                    This population-based study included sinus-rhythm ECG participants seen from November 29, 2004 through July 13, 2020, and a subset with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (October 10, 2011, through November 2, 2017). The AI-ECG score of AF risk calculated for participants was 0-1. To determine the AI-ECG-AF relationship with baseline cognitive dysfunction, we compared linear mixed-effects models with global and domain-specific cognitive z-scores from longitudinal neuropsychological assessments. The AI-ECG-AF score was logit transformed and modeled with cubic splines. For the brain-MRI subset, logistic regression evaluated correlation of the AI-ECG-AF score and the high-threshold, dichotomized AI-ECG-AF score with infarcts.              Results:                    Participants (N=3729; median age, 74.1 years) underwent cognitive analysis. Adjusting for age, sex, education, and APOE É4-carrier status, the AI-ECG-AF score correlated with lower baseline and faster decline in global-cognitive z-scores (P=.009 and P=.01, respectively, non-linear-based spline-models tests) and attention z-scores (P<.001 and P=.01, respectively). Sinus-rhythm-ECG participants (n=1373) underwent MRI. As a continuous measure, the AI-ECG-AF score correlated with infarcts but not after age and sex adjustment (P=.52). For dichotomized analysis, an AI-ECG-AF score greater than 0.5 correlated with infarcts (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.45-8.55; P<.001); even after age and sex adjustment (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.06-4.07; P=.03).              Conclusion:                    The AI-ECG-AF score correlated with worse baseline cognition and gradual global cognition and attention decline. High AF probability by AI-ECG-AF score correlated with MRI cerebral infarcts. However, most infarcts observed in our cohort were subcortical, suggesting that AI-ECG not only predicts AF but also detects other non-AF cardiac disease markers and correlates with small vessel cerebrovascular disease and cognitive decline.",-1
Circulating microRNAâ?23 attenuates the phosphorylation of calcium handling proteins in atrial fibrillation,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small nonâcoding RNAs that control patterns of gene expression by inducing the degradation of mRNAs. In addition, miRNAs are known to serve an important role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). In general, AF is diagnosed using electrocardiography. However, the present study investigated whether specific miRNAs derived from microarray analysis of human urine could regulate AF through the inhibition of calcium handling protein phosphorylation in an AF model. Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the human urine of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and AF revealed that 7 differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly downregulated (miRâ?613, 6763, 423, 3162, 1180, 6511, 3197) in patients with AF. In addition, quantitative PCR results demonstrated that collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin and TGFâÎ? which are fibrosisârelated genes, were upregulated in patients with AF. Furthermore, fibrosisârelated genes were upregulated in angiotensin IIâinduced atrial myocytes, which demonstrated that these genes may be targets of miRâ?23. In the AF cell model transfected with miRâ?23, the expression of calcium handling proteins, including phosphorylated calmodulinâdependent protein kinase II, was reduced. The transfection of miRâ?23 attenuated damage to cardiac cells caused by calcium handling proteins. The findings highlight the importance of calcium handling protein phosphorylation changes in fibrosisâinduced AF and support miRâ?23 detection in human urine as a potential novel approach of AF diagnosis.",-1
One-step isothermal amplification strategy for microRNA specific and ultrasensitive detection based on nicking-assisted entropy-driven DNA circuit triggered exponential amplification reaction,"Sensitive and specific detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) is of critical significance for early diagnosis of cancers such as pancreatic cancer with atypical initial symptoms and high mortality. Despite exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR) is an attractive isothermal amplification method for detecting miRNAs, it faces the problems of the dependence difference and low specificity. To address such challenges, herein, a nicking-assisted entropy-driven DNA circuit triggered exponential amplification reaction (NAED-EXPAR) was firstly employed for ultrasensitive and specific detection of miRNA in ""one-pot"" manner at constant temperature. Nicking-assisted entropy-driven DNA circuit can specifically recognize the target miRNA, leading to continuous disassembly of DNA substrates via intramolecular toehold-mediated branch migration. During the reaction, the catalytic circuit can consume excess fuel DNA strands to produce a large number of primers. Then the newly formed primers can trigger EXPAR for highly efficient signal amplification. Mechanism analysis shows that the amplification efficiency of NAED-EXPAR is superior than that of single EXPAR. For miR-21, the detection limit of NAED-EXPAR can reach 100 aM, which is at least five orders of magnitude higher than the standard EXPAR that directly uses the target as primer. NAED-EXPAR shows improved specificity for identifying single nucleotide variations and enables sensitive and accurate analysis of miR-21 in human cancer cell lines. This method is expected to offer a new approach for the reliable quantification of miRNAs in complex biological matrices and provide valuable information for early cancer diagnosis.",-1
Effects of hsa-mir-145-5p on the Regulation of msln Expression in Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common gastrointestinal cancers in the world, and its incidence is increasing all over the world including China. In recent years, research data show that some miRNAs are differentially expressed in cancer tissues, and their expression is closely contributed with the prognosis of CRC. Microarray technology was used, and 179 miRNAs were screened out with significantly altered expression in CRC tissues compared with adjacent tissues. The expression of mir-145-5p in tumor tissues was 3.48 times lower than that in normal tissues. Using bioinformatics technology and network resource prediction, we found that mir-145-5p had a potential target gene relationship with msln gene. Then, qRT-PCR was used to validate the expression level of mir-145-5p and msln mRNA in CRC and paracancerous tissues. The results showed that msln mRNA was higher than in normal tissues, while mir-145-5p was lower, with statistically significant difference (P < 0.01, n = 3). Furthermore, the expression of msln protein in CRC and normal colorectal tissues was detected by protein mass spectrometry (MRM) (n = 3) and immunohistochemistry in a total case of 30 colorectal cancer tissues and normal tissues. Result showed that the positive expression of msln in CRC was higher than that in normal colorectal tissues, 1.38e-6 and 1.89e-6, respectively (P < 0.01, n = 3). Furthermore, in 48 h RTCA real-time monitoring experiment, mir-145-5p showed inhibitory effect on the proliferation of colo320 cells stimulated by msln. This study demonstrated that msln is a target gene of mir-145-5p in CRC. Besides, mir-145-5p negatively regulates the proliferation of CRC colo320 cells through downregulating msln gene expression in CRC colo320 cells.",-1
Ensuring the Efficacious Iron Fortification of Foods: A Tale of Two Barriers,"Iron fortification of foods has always been a challenge. This is because iron fortification compounds vary widely in relative absorption; because many foods undergo unacceptable changes in color or flavor from the addition of iron; and because many of the iron-fortified foods contain potent inhibitors of iron absorption. These technical barriers have largely been overcome, and efficacious iron-fortified foods, that maintain or improve the iron status of women or children in long-term feeding studies, can be designed. Commercially fortified infant foods are efficacious, and other commercial iron-fortified foods targeted at women and children will provide a useful amount of iron provided the fortification level is adjusted according to the relative absorption of the iron compound. Technologies for the large-scale fortification of wheat and maize flour are also well established, and iron fortification of rice, using the recently developed extruded premix technique, is showing great promise. However, some important knowledge gaps still remain, and further research and development is needed in relation to iron (and iodine)-fortified salt and iron-fortified liquid milk. The usefulness of less-soluble iron compounds, such as ferrous fumarate, to fortify foods for infants and young children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) also needs further investigation. A more formidable barrier to efficacious iron-fortified food has been reported in recent years. This is the infection-initiated inflammation barrier, which inhibits iron absorption in response to infection. This barrier is particularly important in LMICs where infections such as malaria and HIV are widespread, and gastrointestinal infections are common due to poor quality water supplies and sanitation. Another source of inflammation in such countries is the high prevalence of obesity in women. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa have high inflammation which not only decreases the efficacy of iron-fortified and iron-biofortified foods but complicates the monitoring of large-scale iron fortification programs. This is because iron deficiency anemia cannot be differentiated from the more prominent anemia of inflammation and because inflammation confounds the measurement of iron status. There is an urgent need to better quantify the impact of inflammation on the efficacy of iron-fortified foods. However, at present, in LMICs with high inflammation exposure, infection control, cleaner water, improved sanitation, and a decrease in obesity prevalence will undoubtedly have a greater impact on iron status and anemia than the iron fortification of foods.",-1
Magnetic resonance thermometry and its biological applications - Physical principles and practical considerations,"Most parameters that influence the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal experience a temperature dependence. The fact that MRI can be used for non-invasive measurements of temperature and temperature change deep inside the human body has been known for over 30 years. Today, MR temperature imaging is widely used to monitor and evaluate thermal therapies such as radio frequency, microwave, laser, and focused ultrasound therapy. In this paper we cover the physical principles underlying the biological applications of MR temperature imaging and discuss practical considerations and remaining challenges. For biological tissue, the MR signal of interest comes mostly from hydrogen protons of water molecules but also from protons in, e.g., adipose tissue and various metabolites. Most of the discussed methods, such as those using the proton resonance frequency (PRF) shift, T1, T2, and diffusion only measure temperature change, but measurements of absolute temperatures are also possible using spectroscopic imaging methods (taking advantage of various metabolite signals as internal references) or various types of contrast agents. Currently, the PRF method is the most used clinically due to good sensitivity, excellent linearity with temperature, and because it is largely independent of tissue type. Because the PRF method does not work in adipose tissues, T1- and T2-based methods have recently gained interest for monitoring temperature change in areas with high fat content such as the breast and abdomen. Absolute temperature measurement methods using spectroscopic imaging and contrast agents often offer too low spatial and temporal resolution for accurate monitoring of ablative thermal procedures, but have shown great promise in monitoring the slower and usually less spatially localized temperature change observed during hyperthermia procedures. Much of the current research effort for ablative procedures is aimed at providing faster measurements, larger field-of-view coverage, simultaneous monitoring in aqueous and adipose tissues, and more motion-insensitive acquisitions for better precision measurements in organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys. For hyperthermia applications, larger coverage, motion insensitivity, and simultaneous aqueous and adipose monitoring are also important, but great effort is also aimed at solving the problem of long-term field drift which gets interpreted as temperature change when using the PRF method.",-1
"Role of diet-microbiota interactions in precision nutrition of the chicken: facts, gaps, and new concepts","In the intestine, host-derived factors are genetically hardwired and difficult to modulate. However, the intestinal microbiome is more plastic and can be readily modulated by dietary factors. Further, it is becoming more apparent that the microbiome can potentially impact poultry physiology by participating in digestion, the absorption of nutrients, shaping of the mucosal immune response, energy homeostasis, and the synthesis or modulation of several potential bioactive metabolites. These activities are dependent on the quantity and quality of the microbiota alongside its metabolic potential, which are dictated in large part by diet. Thus, diet-induced microbiota alterations may be harnessed to induce changes in host physiology, including disease development and progression. In this regard, the gut microbiome is malleable and renders the gut microbiome a candidate 'organ' for the possibility of precision nutrition to induce precision microbiomics-the use of the gut microbiome as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to specific dietary constituents to generate precision diets and interventions for optimal poultry performance and health. However, it is vital to identify the causal relationships and mechanisms by which dietary components and additives affect the gut microbiome which then ultimately influence avian physiology. Further, an improved understanding of the spatial and functional relationships between the different sections of the avian gut and their regional microbiota will provide a better understanding of the role of the diet in regulating the intestinal microbiome.",-1
Histological Analysis of the Effect of ATX-101 (Deoxycholic Acid Injection) on Subcutaneous Fat: Results From a Phase 1 Open-Label Study,"Background:                    ATX-101 is approved for submental fat reduction.              Objective:                    To characterize the histological effect of ATX-101 injection into subcutaneous fat.              Methods:                    This Phase 1 open-label study enrolled 14 adults to receive injections of ATX-101 into abdominal fat at varying concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, or 4.0%), volumes (0.2 or 0.4 mL), spacing (0.7, 1.0, or 1.5 cm), and time points before scheduled abdominoplasty (1, 3, 7, or 28 days). During abdominoplasty, tissue was excised and preserved for histology.              Results:                    All injection paradigms resulted in histological changes confined to the subcutaneous layer, which were more prominent at higher concentrations and independent of volume and spacing. Key features at Day 1 after injection were adipocytolysis, blood vessel injury, neutrophilic inflammation, and lysis of locally present neutrophils. At Day 3, inflammation was reduced versus Day 1, and hemorrhage and lipid lake formation (at higher concentrations) were observed. Day 7 samples exhibited prominent adipocytolysis, mild inflammation, lipid-laden macrophages in the septae, and repair of vascular injury. At Day 28, inflammation was largely resolved and prominent features were septal thickening, neovascularization, and atrophy of fat lobules.              Conclusion:                    Subcutaneous injection of ATX-101 induces adipocytolysis and local inflammation with septal thickening and resolution of inflammation by 28 days after injection.",-1
Methylsulfonylmethane protects against lethal dose MRSA-induced sepsis through promoting M2 macrophage polarization,"Background:                    Multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections, which have become a global threat, lack effective treatments. The discoveries of non-antibiotics with different modes of antibacterial action, such as methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), are a promising new treatment for multi-drug-resistant pathogens.              Methods:                    We constructed a mouse peritonitis infection model to evaluate the effects of MSM against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The time-kill kinetics of MSM against MRSA and the effect of MSM on the integrity of bacterial cell membrane were measured. Viability effects of MSM on THP1 cells were performed by CCK-8 cytotoxicity assay. Systematic inflammatory factor levels of mice were detected using ELISA. The immune response of peritoneal macrophages during MRSA-infection was evaluated using RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology function, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses, and correlation analyses were applied to analysis RNA sequencing data. RT-qPCR, western blotting and flow cytometry were performed to analysis the gene and protein expression levels of macrophages.              Results:                    In in vitro experiments, MSM did not show significant killing effects on the growth of MRSA directly and did not destroy bacterial membrane integrity. MSM also displayed no significant effects on the proliferative capacity of THP1 cells. However, MSM treatment protected mice against a lethal dose MRSA-infection and decreased systemic inflammation. MSM upregulated metabolic pathway in peritoneal macrophages, especial glycolysis, during MRSA infection. MSM increased the expression of M2 markers (such as Arg1), promoted phosphorylation of STAT3 (which regulates M2 polarization), and decreased the expression of M1 markers in peritoneal macrophages. Additionally, MSM treatment increased the expression of H3K18 lactylation specific target genes, including Arg1. GNE-140, the LDHA-specific inhibitor of glycolysis, blocked the MSM-induced Arg1 expression in this disease model.              Conclusions:                    MSM protects against MRSA infection through immunomodulation. MSM promotes the expression of Arg1 by lactate-H3K18la pathway to control macrophage to M2 polarization; it firstly provides therapeutic potential for drug-resistant infections and sepsis.",-1
"Effective detection of abnormal gait patterns in Parkinson's disease patients using kinematics, nonlinear, and stability gait features","Background and objectives:                    Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that produces movement disorders and it is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. Among other symptoms, PD affects gait patterns and produces bradykinesia, abnormal changes in posture, and shortened strides. In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of three different feature sets to model those abnormal gait patterns. The proposed approach is evaluated upon three groups of subjects: PD patients, young healthy controls (YHC), and elderly healthy controls (EHC).              Methods:                    Three feature sets are created: (1) kinematic measures including those that allow modeling time, distance and velocity of the strides, (2) nonlinear dynamics including different measures extracted from embedded attractors resulting from the time-series of the gait signals, and (3) different stability measures extracted in the time and frequency-domains. Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are trained to automatically discriminate between PD patients and healthy subjects.              Results:                    Among the considered feature sets, three individual measures emerge as the ones that yield accurate detection of PD and could potentially be used in clinical practice. Accuracies of up to 87.0% and 90.0% are found for the classification between PD vs. YHC and PD vs. EHC, respectively, considering individual measures.              Conclusions:                    This study contributes to a better understanding of abnormal gait patterns observed in PD patients. Particularly the introduced approach shows good results that could be potentially used in clinical practice as a tool to support the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients.",-1
Stem cell therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: An update,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a deadly disease, and there currently is no cure for this life-threating medical problem. The average lifespan is about 5 to 7 years after diagnosis of PAH. Therefore, a conceptual breakthrough to develop new therapeutic strategies for PAH is urgently needed. Growing evidence shows that stem cells are emerging as a novel effective treatment, but the understanding of its underlying mechanisms is still limited. This review highlights the mechanisms through which stem cells successfully reverse pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell over-proliferation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in PAH patients and common rodent models used in PAH research. They can modulate common underlying pathways involved in PAH, including the nitric oxide synthase, mitochondrial regulators, microRNAs and STAT3-BMPR signaling. Genetic modifications further enhance the therapeutic effects of stem cells on PAH. Clinical trials showed promising therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells for PAH. Potential limitations and challenges are also discussed. The current findings support the need for further investigation and validation of stem cell therapy for PAH.",-1
"High-Fat Breakfast Meal Replacement in Overweight and Obesity: Implications on Body Composition, Metabolic Markers, and Satiety","The purpose of this paper was to determine the effect of replacing breakfast with a high-fat drink on fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), percent body fat (%BF), visceral fat (VAT), resting metabolic rate (RMR), fuel utilization (RER), blood lipids and satiety in overweight and obese adults. Healthy adults (n = 42; 21 Females; body mass index (BMI): 32.8 Â± 4.6 kgÂ·m-2) were randomized to control (CON; n = 21) or meal replacement (MRP; n = 22) groups. Body composition was measured using a four-compartment model; RMR and RER were assessed from indirect calorimetry. The MRP (70% fat) was consumed once daily for eight weeks. For males, there was no change (p > 0.05) in FM (mean difference (MD) = 0.41 Â± 1.19 kg], %BF MD = 0.50 Â± 1.09%, LM MD = -0.64 Â± 1.79 kg, or VAT MD = -0.31 Â± 1.36 cm for MRP versus CON. Similarly, no differences for females for FM MD = -0.73 Â± 1.37 kg, %BF MD = -0.57 Â± 1.26%, LM MD = 0.31 Â± 1.37 kg, or VAT MD: -0.83 Â± 1.2 cm. HDL was significantly reduced in the MRP group for females (adjusted mean change: -6.41 Â± 4.44 units, p = 0.018). There was no effect on RMR or RER. Satiety increased in the afternoon for MRP (p = 0.021). Despite high fat, no negative impact on lipids resulted; increased satiety may be beneficial for controlling afternoon cravings, but does not affect body composition.",-1
Application of a Minimally Invasive Liposuction Technique for Harvesting Fat during Transsphenoidal Surgery: A Technical Note,"Secure reconstruction in transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) is important for the prevention of the major and serious complication of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. Although abdominal fat can be safely and effectively used as a reconstruction tissue, harvesting it from the abdominal wall is traumatic and invasive, resulting in cosmetic problems. In this report, we present a method of harvesting abdominal fat using a minimally invasive liposuction technique to avoid cosmetic issues. Since 2016, we have been using fat harvested from the abdominal wall by suctioning with a dedicated syringe for reconstruction after TSS in selected cases. The liquefied fat obtained by the liposuction technique was wrapped with an oxycellulose sheet and changed its form to what we termed ""fatty candy"". In this form, the fat maintained its configuration and could be handled almost as easily as a conventional fat graft. In our experienced series, there was no case with wound complication nor postoperative or late-onset CSF leak during a postoperative follow-up of at least 3 months. The fat harvested by this simple and minimally invasive liposuction technique can be expected to provide an autologous graft that is adequate not only for prevention of cosmetic problems but also for prevention of postoperative CSF leak.",-1
The emerging role of epigenetics and gut microbiota in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome,"Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized often by acute diffuse uveitis, also known as idiopathic uveoencephalitis. The associated complications can potentially affect multiple systems throughout the body, including eyes, ears, skin and nervous system. Although the pathogenesis of VKH syndrome remains unclear, it has been established that the various genetic factors, epigenetic factors and the imbalance in immune regulation can significantly contribute to the development of this disease. In addition, the experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) has been commonly used to further explore the pathogenesis of the disease. Herein, in this review article, we discuss about the major research advances made in understanding of the different epigenetic factors and gut microbes involved in the pathogenesis of VKH syndrome as well as EAU. The information discussed can help to better understand the pathogenesis of VKH syndrome, and thereby might provide a basis for finding novel molecular targets and innovative treatment strategies in the future.",-1

[A three dimensional convolutional neural network pulmonary nodule detection algorithm based on the multi-scale attention mechanism],"Early screening based on computed tomography (CT) pulmonary nodule detection is an important means to reduce lung cancer mortality, and in recent years three dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) has achieved success and continuous development in the field of lung nodule detection. We proposed a pulmonary nodule detection algorithm by using 3D CNN based on a multi-scale attention mechanism. Aiming at the characteristics of different sizes and shapes of lung nodules, we designed a multi-scale feature extraction module to extract the corresponding features of different scales. Through the attention module, the correlation information between the features was mined from both spatial and channel perspectives to strengthen the features. The extracted features entered into a pyramid-similar fusion mechanism, so that the features would contain both deep semantic information and shallow location information, which is more conducive to target positioning and bounding box regression. On representative LUNA16 datasets, compared with other advanced methods, this method significantly improved the detection sensitivity, which can provide theoretical reference for clinical medicine.",-1
Gut Microbiota: A Key Regulator in the Effects of Environmental Hazards on Modulates Insulin Resistance,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), type II diabetes (T2D), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are typically characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and their metabolites. Currently, it is understood that environmental hazards including ionizing radiation, toxic heavy metals, pesticides, particle matter, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with gut microbiota and have a non-beneficial health effect. Based on the current study, we propose the hypothesis of ""gut microenvironment baseline drift"". According to this ""baseline drift"" theory, gut microbiota is a temporarily combined cluster of species sharing the same environmental stresses for a short period, which would change quickly under the influence of different environmental factors. This indicates that the microbial species in the gut do not have a long-term relationship; any split, division, or recombination may occur in different environments. Nonetheless, the ""baseline drift"" theory considers the critical role of the response of the whole gut microbiome. Undoubtedly, this hypothesis implies that the gut microbiota response is not merely a ""cross junction"" switch; in contrast, the human health or disease is a result of a rich palette of gut-microbiota-driven multiple-pathway responses. In summary, environmental factors, including hazardous and normal factors, are critical to the biological impact of the gut microbiota responses and the dual effect of the gut microbiota on the regulation of biological functions. Novel appreciation of the role of gut microbiota and environmental hazards in the insulin resistance would shed new light on insulin resistance and also promote the development of new research direction and new overcoming strategies for patients.",-1
The Smart Life Stay (SLS) program: effects of a lifestyle intervention program in combination with health tourism and health guidance for type 2 diabetes,"Background:                    The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the Smart Life Stay (SLS) program, which is an experience-oriented stayover program, in combination with health tourism and mandatory health guidance on glucose metabolism after 2 years.              Methods:                    The participants of the SLS program (n = 792) were recruited from a database of 23 medical insurers. They underwent a mandatory health examination termed Specific Health Checkups in 2014. The participants were included if they had diabetes or were at a high risk of diabetes and if they satisfied the following inclusion criteria: (1) body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) > 25, or (2) waist circumference (WC; cm) > 85 for men and > 90 for women, or (3) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; %) > 5.6, or (4) fasting plasma glucose (FPG; mg/dl) > 100. Individuals who corresponded to one or more items were included as study participants. The control subjects (n = 3645) were nonparticipants of the program who were selected from the database and met the inclusion criteria. The lifestyle changes and changes in mean BMI, WC, FPG, and HbA1c in both groups from baseline to 2-year follow-up were compared by inverse probability weighting of a propensity score.              Results:                    The percentage of people who exercised regularly increased significantly in the SLS group compared with the control group. In the SLS group, BW, BMI, and WC significantly decreased by 1.75 kg, 0.60 kg/m2, and 1.45 cm, respectively, whereas in the control group, WC, FPG, and HbA1c increased significantly by 0.38 cm, 3.37 mg/dl, and 0.12%, respectively. The comparison between groups revealed that the BW, BMI, WC, FPG, and HbA1c improved significantly in the SLS group.              Conclusions:                    The SLS program is suggested to help improve glucose metabolism. This program could be a feasible option as a lifestyle intervention program for diabetes.",-1
Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 Performance in Austrian COVID-19 Patients Admitted to Intensive Care Units with and without Diabetes,"This study evaluated and compared the performance of simplified acute physiology score 3 (SAPS 3) for predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with and without diabetes in Austria. The Austrian national public health institute (GÃG) data of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs (n = 5850) were analyzed. Three versions of SAPS 3 were used: standard equation, Central European equation, and Austrian equation customized for COVID-19 patients. The observed in-hospital mortality was 38.9%, 42.9%, and 37.3% in all, diabetes, and non-diabetes patients, respectively. The overall C-statistics was 0.69 with an insignificant (p = 0.193) difference between diabetes (0.70) and non-diabetes (0.68) patients. The Brier score was &gt; 0.20 for all SAPS 3 equations in all cohorts. Calibration was unsatisfactory for both standard and Central European equations in all cohorts, whereas it was satisfactory for the Austrian equation in diabetes patients only. The SAPS 3 score demonstrated low discrimination and accuracy in Austrian COVID-19 patients, with an insignificant difference between diabetes and non-diabetes. All equations were miscalibrated particularly in non-diabetes patients, while the Austrian equation showed satisfactory calibration in diabetes patients only. Both uncalibrated and calibrated versions of SAPS 3 should be used with caution in COVID-19 patients.",-1
UBE2D1 and COX7C as Potential Biomarkers of Diabetes-Related Sepsis,"Patients with diabetes are physiologically frail and more likely to suffer from infections and even life-threatening sepsis. This study aimed to identify and verify potential biomarkers of diabetes-related sepsis (DRS). Datasets GSE7014, GSE57065, and GSE95233 from the Gene Expression Omnibus were used to explore diabetes- and sepsis-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and functional analyses were performed to explore potential functions and pathways associated with sepsis and diabetes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify diabetes- and sepsis-related modules. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to determine the characteristics and pathways of key modules. Intersecting DEGs that were also present in key modules were considered as common DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and key genes were analyzed to screen hub genes involved in DRS development. A mouse C57 BL/6J-DRS model and a neural network prediction model were constructed to verify the relationship between hub genes and DRS. In total, 7457 diabetes-related DEGs and 2606 sepsis-related DEGs were identified. GSEA indicated that gene datasets associated with diabetes and sepsis were mainly enriched in metabolic processes linked to inflammatory responses and reactive oxygen species, respectively. WGCNA indicated that grey60 and brown modules were diabetes- and sepsis-related key modules, respectively. Functional analysis showed that grey60 module genes were mainly enriched in cell morphogenesis, heart development, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, whereas genes from the brown module were mainly enriched in organelle inner membrane, mitochondrion organization, and oxidative phosphorylation. UBE2D1, IDH1, DLD, ATP5C1, COX6C, and COX7C were identified as hub genes in the PPI network. Animal DRS and neural network prediction models indicated that the expression levels of UBE2D1 and COX7C in DRS models and samples were higher than control mice. UBE2D1 and COX7C were identified as potential biomarkers of DRS. These findings may help develop treatment strategies for DRS.",-1
[Difficulties and prospects of standardized management of type 1 diabetes],"Type 1 diabetes patients require lifelong dependence on insulin therapy. It is a long-term challenge for patients to effectively deliver exogenous insulin to maintain glucose levels within the individual's target range as safely as possible for preventing the development and progression of diabetes complications. The management of type 1 diabetes involves multidisciplinary collaboration, referral from different hospitals, and effective diabetes education and management for patients and family members. Compared with the more mature diseases management system in the United States and the United Kindom, the standardized management of type 1 diabetes patients in China started late. Moreover, there are still some difficulties at present. Whereas, with the exploration and efforts of the hospitals at all levels for the management of type 1 diabetes patients, standardization of type 1 diabetes management will gradually step forward and truly realize the lifelong management for patients.",-1
Down-regulation of miR-7-5p and miR-548ar-5p predicts malignancy in indeterminate thyroid nodules negative for BRAF and RAS mutations,"Purpose:                    The value of molecular markers in refining preoperative risk assessment of indeterminate thyroid nodules is being widely investigated. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are emerging as promising biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The aim of this study is to identify miRNAs specifically deregulated in mutation-negative indeterminate thyroid nodules.              Methods:                    Ninety-eight nodules preoperatively diagnosed as TIR 3A or TIR 3B with available histological diagnosis of follicular adenoma (FA), noninvasive follicular neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), and follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (FV-PTC) have been retrospectively selected. Mutations in BRAF and RAS genes have been tested in all samples by real-time PCR; miRNAs were purified from cytology slides of 60 samples; expression analysis of 798 miRNAs was measured by the nCounter system.              Results:                    Point mutations in BRAF and RAS genes were detected in 32 out of 98 nodules (32.7%), the majority of which in FV-PTCs. Differential expression of miRNA in wild-type nodules highlighted that two miRNAs, namely miR-7-5p and miR-548ar-5p, were downregulated in FV-PTCs compared to FAs. The combined expression of these miRNAs, tested by ROC analysis, showed an area under the curve of 0.79. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were high both in wild-type (93% and 92%, respectively) and in mutated nodules (94% and 85%, respectively).              Conclusion:                    The analysis of miR-7-5p and miR-548ar-5p expression in indeterminate thyroid nodules demonstrated a promising value in ruling out malignancy.",-1
lncRNA H19 Promotes Ox-LDL-Induced Dysfunction of Human Aortic Endothelial Cells through the miR-152/VEGFA Axis,"Objective:                    lncRNA H19 (H19) elevation is related to the risk of coronary artery disease. DIANA-lncBase database analysis suggested that microRNA-152 (miR-152) and H19 have binding sites. Here, the effect and mechanism of H19 and miR-152 in the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were explored.              Methods:                    The expression of H19, miR-152, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in the HAECs treated with 5 Î¼g/mL ox-LDL was detected by qRT-PCR. MTT, wound-healing assay, and tube formation assay were analyzed to evaluate the angiogenic activity of H19 and miR-152 in the HAECs cells knocked down H19. Dual-luciferase assay was performed to verify the targeting relationship of miR-152 to either H19 or VEGFA, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins (E-cadherin and vimentin) and VEGFA protein in the cells.              Results:                    After ox-LDL treatment, the expression of H19 and VEGFA was significantly increased, miR-152 expression was remarkably decreased. H19 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of HAECs. Knocking down H19 or overexpression of miR-152 significantly inhibited the cellular proliferation, migration, tube formation, and EMT trend of the HAECs. On the contrary, miR-152 interference reversed H19 silencing-mediated effects in the ox-LDL-induced HAECs. The dual-luciferase assay showed that miR-152 had a targeting relationship with H19 and VEGFA. MiR-152 was negatively corrected with the VEGFA expression.              Conclusion:                    Ox-LDL negatively regulates miR-152 via H19, promotes the expression of VEGFA, and induces the dysfunction of HAECs.",-1
"I could do it now, but I'd rather (forget to) do it later: examining links between procrastination and prospective memory failures","Prospective memory (PM) represents the ability to remember to perform planned actions after a certain delay. As previous studies suggest that even brief task-delays can negatively affect PM performance, the current study set out to examine whether procrastination (intentionally delaying task execution despite possible negative consequences) may represent a factor contributing to PM failures. Specifically, we assessed procrastination (via a standardized questionnaire as well as an objective behavioral measure) and PM failures (via a naturalistic PM task) in 92 young adults. Results show that participants' self-reports as well as their actual procrastination behavior predicted the number of PM failures, corroborating the impact of procrastination on PM. Subsequent cluster analyses suggest three distinct procrastination profiles (non-procrastinators, conscious procrastinators and unconscious procrastinators), providing new conceptual insights into different mechanisms of how procrastinating may lead to forgetting to perform planned tasks.",-1
Cross-sectional study of the prevalence and risk factors of metabolic syndrome in a rural population of the Qianjiang area,"The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) is increasing in China, but there are disparities between urban and rural populations, and across different regions.To examine the prevalence and risk factors of MS in the rural area of Qianjiang (Southwest China).From March 2016 to June 2018, 6 townships in the Qianjiang District of Chongqing Municipality were selected for a cross-sectional study of the residents in rural areas. Demographics and medical history were collected using a questionnaire. Anthropometry and blood pressure were obtained by physical examination. Blood lipids, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h postprandial glucose were measured.A total of 2949 (1067 males and 1882 females) were included. The mean age was 63.8 Â± 10.7 years. The prevalence of MS in the study population was 16.8% (496/2949). The prevalence of MS was 7.4% in men, 22.2% in women, 15.7% in Han, 18.1% in Tujia, and 14.8% in Miao. According to age, the prevalence of MS was 10.6%, 17.0%, and 18.3% in the 30-50, 50-69, and â?70 years groups. The multivariable analysis showed that female sex (OR = 33.36, 95%CI: 17.0-65.53), dyslipidemia (OR = 4.71, 95%CI: 1.73-12.82), kidney diseases (OR = 2.32, 95%CI: 1.37-3.94), waistline (OR = 1.39, 95%CI: 1.33-1.46), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 0.12, 95%CI: 0.06-0.23), triglycerides (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.31-1.76), alanine aminotransferase (OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.97-1.00), Î³-glutamyltransferase (OR = 1.00, 95%CI: 1.00-1.01), and glycated hemoglobin (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.08-1.59) were independently associated with MS.The prevalence of MS was 16.8% in Qianjiang. Female sex, kidney diseases, alanine aminotransferase, and Î³-glutamyltransferase were independent risk factors for MS.",-1
Assessment of anthropometric indices other than BMI to evaluate arterial stiffness,"Based on the obesity paradox, people with a normal body mass index (BMI) may have a higher risk of mortality than those with a BMI that falls within the obese range. Despite the availability of other anthropometric measures, obesity is commonly evaluated based on BMI. A body shape index (ABSI) and body roundness index (BRI) have recently been proposed as new anthropometric measures that are calculated with height, weight, and waist circumference. This study investigated the associations between the traditional and new body composition indices and arterial stiffness using the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). Overall, 3512 individuals (1228 men and 2284 women) were enrolled and were divided into two groups according to BMI. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between baPWV and body composition. baPWV was significantly associated with ABSI (Î² = 0.087, p = 0.002), visceral adipose tissue (VAT; Î² = 0.081, p = 0.002), and the visceral/subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT/SAT) ratio (Î² = 0.108, p < 0.001) in non-obese men. In non-obese women, baPWV was significantly associated with several variables but not the VAT/SAT ratio. Similarly, baPWV was significantly associated with BMI (Î² = 0.103, p = 0.038), BRI (Î² = 0.104, p = 0.036), VAT (Î² = 0.167, p = 0.001), and the VAT/SAT ratio (Î² = 0.106, p = 0.028) in obese women. ABSI can be used with high accuracy to evaluate fat distribution in non-obese men to predict arterial stiffness. However, the BRI should be used in addition to BMI to assess the body composition of women more accurately. ABSI and the BRI can be used to identify predictors of vascular remodeling or organic vascular dysfunction.",-1
Machine learning-based prediction of relapse in rheumatoid arthritis patients using data on ultrasound examination and blood test,"Recent effective therapies enable most rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients to achieve remission; however, some patients experience relapse. We aimed to predict relapse in RA patients through machine learning (ML) using data on ultrasound (US) examination and blood test. Overall, 210 patients with RA in remission at baseline were dichotomized into remission (n = 150) and relapse (n = 60) based on the disease activity at 2-year follow-up. Three ML classifiers [Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)] and data on 73 features (14 US examination data, 54 blood test data, and five data on patient information) at baseline were used for predicting relapse. The best performance was obtained using the XGBoost classifier (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.747), compared with Random Forest and Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.719 and 0.701, respectively). In the XGBoost classifier prediction, ten important features, including wrist/metatarsophalangeal superb microvascular imaging scores, were selected using the recursive feature elimination method. The performance was superior to that predicted by researcher-selected features, which are conventional prognostic markers. These results suggest that ML can provide an accurate prediction of relapse in RA patients, and the use of predictive algorithms may facilitate personalized treatment options.",-1
The Effects of Intermittent Fasting on Glycemic Control and Body Composition in Adults with Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of intermittent fasting on glycemic control and body composition in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although intermittent fasting has shown some promise in improving glucoregulatory indicators and body composition in adults with obesity, there is currently no systematic review evaluating these effects in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. A database search of PubMed, CINHAL, and MEDLINE identified five studies that met inclusion criterion. All studies were randomized controlled trials in adult subjects (n = 46-137) with type 2 diabetes and a body mass index of â?0 kg/m2. Four different intermittent fasting regimens were reviewed. All fasting regimens revealed strong evidence to support intermittent fasting as a feasible diet to improve glycemia and body composition measures within 12-24 weeks. Follow-up 12-18 months after intermittent fasting did not show promising results for continued weight loss and improved glycemic control. The majority of the studies demonstrated insignificant differences between intermittent fasting and continuous energy restriction for measures of glycated hemoglobin a1c and body composition. More data on intermittent fasting in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes are needed to determine its benefits within this patient population. Future research should include consistent fasting regimens and larger sample sizes to improve the reliability and generalizability of the data. Also, consistent follow-up after a fasting intervention may enhance long-term benefits and should be considered in future research.",-1
The Role of Glp-1 Receptor Agonists in Insulin Resistance with Concomitant Obesity Treatment in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Insulin resistance is documented in clamp studies in 75% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Although it is not included in the diagnostic criteria of PCOS, there is a crucial role of this metabolic impairment, which along with hormonal abnormalities, increase each other in a vicious circle of PCOS pathogenesis. Insulin resistance in this group of patients results from defects at the molecular level, including impaired insulin receptor-related signaling pathways enhanced by obesity and its features: Excess visceral fat, chronic inflammation, and reactive oxygen species. While lifestyle intervention has a first-line role in the prevention and management of excess weight in PCOS, the role of anti-obesity pharmacological agents in achieving and maintaining weight loss is being increasingly recognized. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) not only act by reducing body weight but also can affect the mechanisms involved in insulin resistance, like an increasing expression of glucose transporters in insulin-dependent tissues, decreasing inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating lipid metabolism. They also tend to improve fertility either by increasing LH surge in hypothalamus-pituitary inhibition due to estrogen excess connected with obesity or decreasing too high LH levels accompanying hyperinsulinemia. GLP1-RAs seem promising for effective treatment of obese PCOS patients, acting on one of the primary causes of PCOS at the molecular level.",-1
Review of Thermal and Physiological Properties of Human Breast Tissue,"Electromagnetic thermal therapies for cancer treatment, such as microwave hyperthermia, aim to heat up a targeted tumour site to temperatures within 40 and 44 Â°C. Computational simulations used to investigate such heating systems employ the Pennes' bioheat equation to model the heat exchange within the tissue, which accounts for several tissue properties: density, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, metabolic heat generation rate, and blood perfusion rate. We present a review of these thermal and physiological properties relevant for hyperthermia treatments of breast including fibroglandular breast, fatty breast, and breast tumours. The data included in this review were obtained from both experimental measurement studies and estimated properties of human breast tissues. The latter were used in computational studies of breast thermal treatments. The measurement methods, where available, are discussed together with the estimations and approximations considered for values where measurements were unavailable. The review concludes that measurement data for the thermal and physiological properties of breast and tumour tissue are limited. Fibroglandular and fatty breast tissue properties are often approximated from those of generic muscle or fat tissue. Tumour tissue properties are mostly obtained from approximating equations or assumed to be the same as those of glandular tissue. We also present a set of reliable data, which can be used for more accurate modelling and simulation studies to better treat breast cancer using thermal therapies.",-1
Effects of resistant starch on glycaemic control: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"The effects of resistant starch on glycaemic control are controversial. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis of results from nineteen randomised controlled trials (RCT) was performed to illustrate the effects of resistant starch on glycaemic control. A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane electronic databases for related publications from inception to 6 April 2020. Key inclusion criteria were: RCT; resistant starch as intervention substances and reporting glucose- and insulin-related endpoints. Exclusion criteria were: using type I resistant starch or a mixture of resistant starch and other functional food ingredients as intervention; using substances other than digestible starch as controls. The effect of resistant starch on fasting plasma glucose was significant (effect size (ES) -0Â·09 (95 % CI -0Â·13, -0Â·04) mmol/l, P = 0Â·001) compared with digestible starch. Subgroup analyses revealed that the ES was larger when the dosage of resistant starch was more than 28 g/d (ES -0Â·16 (95 % CI -0Â·24, -0Â·08) mmol/l, P < 0Â·001) or the intervention period was more than 8 weeks (ES -0Â·12 (95 % CI -0Â·18, -0Â·06) mmol/l, P < 0Â·001). The effect on homoeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-insulin resistance (IR) was significant (ES -0Â·33 (95 % CI -0Â·51, -0Â·14), P = 0Â·001). However, the effects on other insulin-related endpoints were not significant, including fasting plasma insulin, four endpoints from the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (insulin sensitivity index, acute insulin response, disposition index and glucose effectiveness) and HOMA-Î². The current study indicated moderate effects of resistant starch on improving glycaemic control.",-1
Radiosensitizer EXO-miR-197-3p Inhibits Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Progression and Radioresistance by Regulating the AKT/mTOR Axis and HSPA5-mediated Autophagy,"The biological functions of exosomes and microRNAs (miRs) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain largely unexplored. Here, miR-197-3p was screened and identified, and whose level was reduced in serum and exosomes of patients with NPC. MiR-197-3p might be a good diagnostic and prognostic indicator. Our data showed that miR-197-3p expression was closely related to radioresistance, apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and survival of NPC. Inhibition of miR-197-3p expression in vitro could promote the proliferation and migration of NPC cells, while promotion of miR-197-3p expression in vivo could significantly inhibit the growth and enhance the radiosensitivity of NPC cells. From the perspective of mechanism, miR-197-3p could inhibit AKT/mTOR phosphorylation activation, inhibit an activated pathway of AKT/mTOR, target Heat Shock 70-kDa Protein 5(HSPA5) related to endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, inhibit HSPA5-mediated autophagy, and reverse the radioresistance of NPC. Interestingly, exosomal miR-197-3p (EXO-miR-197-3p) reduced the proliferation and migration potential of NPC cells in vitro, and tumor growth and radioresistance of NPC cells in vivo. EXO-miR-197-3p inhibited NPC progression and radioresistance by regulating AKT/mTOR phosphorylation activation and HSPA5-mediated autophagy. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of EXO-miR-197-3p as an effective radiosensitizer and therapeutic agent for refractory NPC.",-1
Rescue of Î±-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson's patient neurons by synergistic enhancement of ER proteostasis and protein trafficking,"Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by a collapse in proteostasis, as shown by the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates in the brain. Proteostasis involves a balance of protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation, but how aggregates perturb these pathways is unknown. Using Parkinson's disease (PD) patient midbrain cultures, we find that aggregated Î±-synuclein induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fragmentation and compromises ER protein folding capacity, leading to misfolding and aggregation of immature lysosomal Î²-glucocerebrosidase. Despite this, PD neurons fail to initiate the unfolded protein response, indicating perturbations in sensing or transducing protein misfolding signals in the ER. Small molecule enhancement of ER proteostasis machinery promotes Î²-glucocerebrosidase solubility, while simultaneous enhancement of trafficking improves ER morphology, lysosomal function, and reduces Î±-synuclein. Our studies suggest that aggregated Î±-synuclein perturbs the ability of neurons to respond to misfolded proteins in the ER, and that synergistic enhancement of multiple proteostasis branches may provide therapeutic benefit in PD.",-1
Effect of alternate-day fasting on obesity and cardiometabolic risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background & aims:                    Alternate-day fasting (ADF) is related to weight reduction, lowered risks of weight regain, and relative lean body mass preservation compared to continuous energy restriction. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of ADF on obesity-related factors and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults.              Methods:                    Using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane online databases, an electronic search was performed. Randomized controlled trials were investigated to evaluate ADF effects on body mass index (BMI), body weight (BW), waist circumference, body fat mass (FM), lean body mass, and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults aged â?8 years. By utilizing a random-effects model, meta-analyses to assess weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were performed for eight randomized controlled trials (total participants = 728).              Results:                    We observed significant effects of ADF for BMI (WMD -0.73 kg/m2, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.34), FM (WMD -1.27 kg, 95% CI -2.09 to -0.46), and total cholesterol (WMD -8.14 mg/dL, 95% CI -14.59 to -1.69). Subgroup analyses indicated that significant intervention effects were observed for BMI, BW, FM, and total cholesterol when compared to the control, the participants were overweight, and the study duration was <6 months. ADF is effective in reducing waist circumference in adults aged â?0 years with obesity. However, there was no difference between ADF and continuous energy restriction, time-restricted feeding, or control with regard to lean body mass.              Conclusions:                    Current evidence suggests that ADF effectively lowers BMI, BW, FM, and total cholesterol in adults with overweight within 6 months compared to the control.",-1
Explainable AI toward understanding the performance of the top three TADPOLE Challenge methods in the forecast of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,"The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge is the most comprehensive challenge to date with regard to the number of subjects, considered features, and challenge participants. The initial objective of TADPOLE was the identification of the most predictive data, features, and methods for the progression of subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer's. The challenge was successful in recognizing tree-based ensemble methods such as gradient boosting and random forest as the best methods for the prognosis of the clinical status in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the challenge outcome was limited to which combination of data processing and methods exhibits the best accuracy; hence, it is difficult to determine the contribution of the methods to the accuracy. The quantification of feature importance was globally approached by all the challenge participant methods. In addition, TADPOLE provided general answers that focused on improving performance while ignoring important issues such as interpretability. The purpose of this study is to intensively explore the models of the top three TADPOLE Challenge methods in a common framework for fair comparison. In addition, for these models, the most meaningful features for the prognosis of the clinical status of AD are studied and the contribution of each feature to the accuracy of the methods is quantified. We provide plausible explanations as to why the methods achieve such accuracy, and we investigate whether the methods use information coherent with clinical knowledge. Finally, we approach these issues through the analysis of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a technique that has recently attracted increasing attention in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).",-1
CTSV (cathepsin V) promotes bladder cancer progression by increasing NF-ÎºB activity,"Chronic inflammation is positively associated with the development of urinary bladder cancer. However, its detailed regulatory mechanism remains elusive. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure mRNA levels of relative genes. The protein levels were monitored by western blotting. Cell proliferation and viability were evaluated by the cell counting Kit 8 (CCK8) and colony formation assays, respectively. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to assay the transcriptional activity. In vivo experiments were implemented in nude mice as well. The TCGA database analysis suggested that the aberrant expression of cathepsin V (CTSV) was related to a poor outcome in bladder cancer patients. CTSV boosted the inflammation reaction, which facilitated the development of bladder cancer. The overexpression of CTSV increased the proliferation and viability of bladder cancer cells. On the contrary, the deletion of CTSV significantly inhibited the proliferation and viability of bladder cancer cells. The tumor repression resulting from CTSV deficiency in vitro was also verified in vivo. Moreover, multiple cancer-associated luciferase screening showed that the overexpression of CTSV triggered the inflammatory signaling pathway, which could be restored by introducing the NF-ÎºB inhibitor. CTSV is upregulated and promotes proliferation through the NF-ÎºB pathway in bladder cancer and may be a potential target in inflammation-associated bladder cancer.",-1
Interactions between timing and transmissibility explain diverse flavivirus dynamics in Fiji,"Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused large, brief outbreaks in isolated populations, however ZIKV can also persist at low levels over multiple years. The reasons for these diverse transmission dynamics remain poorly understood. In Fiji, which has experienced multiple large single-season dengue epidemics, there was evidence of multi-year transmission of ZIKV between 2013 and 2017. To identify factors that could explain these differences in dynamics between closely related mosquito-borne flaviviruses, we jointly fit a transmission dynamic model to surveillance, serological and molecular data. We estimate that the observed dynamics of ZIKV were the result of two key factors: strong seasonal effects, which created an ecologically optimal time of year for outbreaks; and introduction of ZIKV after this optimal time, which allowed ZIKV transmission to persist over multiple seasons. The ability to jointly fit to multiple data sources could help identify a similar range of possible outbreak dynamics in other settings.",-1
Complement activation in polycystic ovary syndrome occurs in the postprandial and fasted state and is influenced by obesity and insulin sensitivity,"Objective:                    Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with metabolic risk. Complement proteins regulate inflammation and lipid clearance but their role in PCOS-associated metabolic risk is unclear. We sought to establish whether the complement system is activated in PCOS in the fasting and postprandial state.              Design:                    Case-control study.              Patients:                    Fasting complement levels were measured in 84 women with PCOS and 95 healthy controls. Complement activation post-oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) was compared in 40 additional subjects (20 PCOS, 20 controls).              Measurements:                    Activation pathway (C3, C4, C3a(desArg), factor B, factor H, properdin, Factor D) and terminal pathway (C5, C5a, terminal complement complex [TCC]) proteins were measured by commercial or in-house assays.              Results:                    Fasting C3, C3a(desArg) and TCC concentrations were increased in insulin-resistant (adjusted differences: C3 0.13 g/L [95%CI 0-0.25]; C3a(desArg) 319.2 ng/mL [19.5-619]; TCC 0.66 Î¼g/mL [0.04-1.28]) but not in insulin-sensitive women with PCOS. C3 and factor H levels increased with obesity. Post-OFTT, C3 and C4 levels increased to a similar extent in PCOS subjects and controls, whist factor H levels increased more in women with PCOS compared to controls (adjusted differences (area under the curve): 12 167 Î¼g min/mL [4942-19 392]), particularly in the presence of concomitant obesity.              Conclusions:                    Activation and terminal complement pathway components are elevated in patients with PCOS, especially in the presence of insulin resistance and obesity.",-1
Switching Host Metabolism as an Approach to Dampen SARS-CoV-2 Infection,"Background:                    COVID-19 pandemic, a global threat, adversely affects all daily lives, altered governmental plans around the world, and urges the development of therapeutics and prophylactics to avoid the expansion of the viral infection. With the recent gradual opening after long lockdown, several recommendations have been placed, with dietary modification as one of the most important approaches that have been appraised.              Summary:                    Here, we are reviewing how changing the host metabolism, particularly changing the host metabolic state from the carbohydrate-dependent glycolytic state to a fat-dependent ketogenic state, may affect viral replication. Furthermore, the impact of intermittent fasting (IF) in triggering metabolic switch along with the impact of supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) such as lauric acid in repressing the envelope formation and viral replication is also addressed. The amalgamation of IF and a ketogenic diet rich in MCTs is thought to work as a prophylactic measure for normal people and adjunct therapy for infected persons. Key Message: A diet regimen of ketogenic breakfast along with supplementation with two doses of lauric acid-rich MCTs at breakfast and lunch times, followed by 8-12-h IF and a dinner rich with fruits and vegetables, could be a potential prophylactic strategy and adjuvant therapy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections.",-1
Downregulation of miR-599 predicts poor outcome in cervical cancer patients and promotes the progression of cervical cancer,"Objective:                    Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of gynecological cancer-related death. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression pattern of miR-599 and its prognostic significance in cervical cancer.              Materials and methods:                    The RT-qPCR analysis was used to detect the expression levels of miR-599 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. The association between miR-599 expression and clinical characteristics of cervical cancer patients was analyzed using the Ï2 test. The Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model were used to explore the prognostic significance of miR-599. Then, CCK-8 assays, transwell migration, and invasion assays were used to assess the effects of miR-599 on tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells, respectively.              Results:                    miR-599 expression was significantly downregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cells compared with non-cancerous tissues and HaCaT cells, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed that miR-599 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis and FIGO stage. The miR-599 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Functionally, overexpression of miR-599 suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells, while downregulation of miR-599 had opposite effects.              Conclusion:                    miR-599 acts as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer that inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical cancer cells, suggesting that miR-599 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and novel targeted strategy for cervical cancer.",-1
Jujube peel polyphenols synergistically inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation through multiple signaling pathways in RAW 264.7 cells,"Jujube has great potential as food and traditional drugs in several countries. To study the anti-inflammatory influence of jujube peel polyphenols in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW 264.7 cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) and nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways. In this study, the phenolic composition of polyphenols in jujube peel was analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and which was confirmed that the main polyphenols were p-coumaric acid, catechin and rutin. Meanwhile, jujube peel polyphenols attenuated the generation of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-6, NO and PGE2 by inhibiting MAPK and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways. Additionally, jujube peel polyphenol activate Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, regulate antioxidant enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Results obtained from this study suggest that jujube peel polyphenols may alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting MAPK and NF-ÎºB and activating Nrf2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, jujube peel polyphenols have a synergistic effect in the treatment of LPS-induced inflammatory in RAW 264.7 cells. In conclusion, this study not only reveals the mechanism by which jujube peel polyphenols inhibit LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells, but also provides guidance for the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs.",-1
Molecular Analysis of Targeted Insecticide Resistance Gene Mutations in Field-Caught Mosquitos of Medical Importance From Saudi Arabia,"Gene mutations on target sites can be a valuable indicator of the status of insecticide resistance. Jeddah, a global commercial and major port-of-entry city, is bearing the brunt of dengue disease burden in Saudi Arabia. In the current study, six genotypes of three codon combinations (989, 1016, and 1534) were observed on voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene in Jeddah's Aedes aegypti population, with PGF/PGC as the dominant one. Two types of introns between exon 20 and 21 on VGSC have been identified for the first time in Ae. aegypti in Saudi Arabia. Statistical and phylogenetic analyses showed that the intron type was significantly associated with the 1016 allele and may reflect the history of insecticide treatment in different continents. In addition, fixation of the L1014F allele on VGSC and G119S on acetylcholinesterase 1 gene was detected in local Culex quinquefasciatus populations, with frequencies of 95.24 and 100%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of resistant-associated mutations in field-caught Cx. quinquefasciatus in Saudi Arabia. The high prevalence of insecticide resistance gene mutations in local primary mosquito vector species highlights the urgent need to carry out comprehensive insecticide resistance surveillance in Saudi Arabia.",-1
Integrating Parasitological and Entomological Observations to Understand Malaria Transmission in Riverine Villages in the Peruvian Amazon,"Background:                    Remote rural riverine villages account for most of the reported malaria cases in the Peruvian Amazon. As transmission decreases due to intensive standard control efforts, malaria strategies in these villages will need to be more focused and adapted to local epidemiology.              Methods:                    By integrating parasitological, entomological, and environmental observations between January 2016 and June 2017, we provided an in-depth characterization of malaria transmission dynamics in 4 riverine villages of the Mazan district, Loreto department.              Results:                    Despite variation across villages, malaria prevalence by polymerase chain reaction in March 2016 was high (>25% in 3 villages), caused by Plasmodium vivax mainly and composed of mostly submicroscopic infections. Housing without complete walls was the main malaria risk factor, while households close to forest edges were more commonly identified as spatial clusters of malaria prevalence. Villages in the basin of the Mazan River had a higher density of adult Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes, and retained higher prevalence and incidence rates compared to villages in the basin of the Napo River despite test-and-treat interventions.              Conclusions:                    High heterogeneity in malaria transmission was found across and within riverine villages, resulting from interactions between the microgeographic landscape driving diverse conditions for vector development, housing structure, and human behavior.",-1
Deep convolutional neural network for classification of thyroid nodules on ultrasound: Comparison of the diagnostic performance with that of radiologists,"Purpose:                    This study aimed to train and validate deep learning (DL) models for differentiating malignant from benign thyroid nodules on US images and compare their performance with that of radiologists.              Methods:                    Images of thyroid nodules in patients who underwent US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy at our institution between January 2010 and March 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Four radiologists independently classified the images. Images of thyroid nodules were trained using three different image classification DL models (VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet). The diagnostic performances of the DL models were calculated for the internal and external datasets and compared with the diagnoses of the four radiologists. Pairwise comparisons of the AUCs between the radiologists and DL models were made using bootstrap-based tests.              Results:                    In total, 15,409 images from 7,321 patients (mean age, 60 Â± 13 years; malignant nodules, 20.7%) were randomly grouped into training (n = 12,327) and validation (n = 3,082) sets. Independent internal (n = 432; 197 patients) and external (n = 168; 59 patients) test sets were also acquired. The DL models demonstrated a higher diagnostic performance than the radiologists in the internal test set (AUC, 0.83 - 0.86 vs. 0.71 - 0.76, P < 0.05), but not in the external test set. The VGG16 model demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance in internal (AUC, 0.86; sensitivity, 91.8%; specificity, 73.2%) and external (AUC: 0.83; sensitivity: 78.6%; specificity: 76.8%) test sets. However, no statistical differences were found in the AUCs among the DL models.              Conclusions:                    The DL models demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance to radiologists in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules on US images and may play a potential role in augmenting radiologists' diagnosis of thyroid nodules.",-1
The miR-98-3p/JAG1/Notch1 axis mediates the multigenerational inheritance of osteopenia caused by maternal dexamethasone exposure in female rat offspring,"As a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone is widely used to treat potential premature delivery and related diseases. Our previous studies have shown that prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) can cause bone dysplasia and susceptibility to osteoporosis in female rat offspring. However, whether the effect of PDE on bone development can be extended to the third generation (F3 generation) and its multigenerational mechanism of inheritance have not been reported. In this study, we found that PDE delayed fetal bone development and reduced adult bone mass in female rat offspring of the F1 generation, and this effect of low bone mass caused by PDE even continued to the F2 and F3 generations. Furthermore, we found that PDE increases the expression of miR-98-3p but decreases JAG1/Notch1 signaling in the bone tissue of female fetal rats. Moreover, the expression changes of miR-98-3p/JAG1/Notch1 caused by PDE continued from the F1 to F3 adult offspring. Furthermore, the expression levels of miR-98-3p in oocytes of the F1 and F2 generations were increased. We also confirmed that dexamethasone upregulates the expression of miR-98-3p in vitro and shows targeted inhibition of JAG1/Notch1 signaling, leading to poor osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. In conclusion, maternal dexamethasone exposure caused low bone mass in female rat offspring with a multigenerational inheritance effect, the mechanism of which is related to the inhibition of JAG1/Notch1 signaling caused by the continuous upregulation of miR-98-3p expression in bone tissues transmitted by F2 and F3 oocytes.",-1
The NF-ÎºB/miR-488/ERBB2 axis modulates pancreatic cancer cell malignancy and tumor growth through cell cycle signaling,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the malignancies having the poorest prognosis due to late diagnoses and lack of efficient treatment regimens. The identification of potential miRNA-targeted gene axes could act as targets for developing novel treatment strategies. Herein, it was assessed that miR-488 expression was markedly downregulated within pancreatic carcinoma. Higher expression of miR-488 was shown to be linked to better prognosis rates of pancreatic carcinoma as per online data. Within two pancreatic tumor cells, MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1, miR-488 overexpression significantly suppressed malignant cytological behavior by inhibiting cell viability, enhancing cell apoptosis, and inducing cell cycle G2/M-phase arrest. Moreover, miR-488 overexpression also decreased the protein levels of cell cycle regulators, including cyclin A, cyclin B, CDK1, and CDK2. miR-488 directly targets ERBB2 (receptor tyrosine-protein kinase2) to suppress the expression of ERBB2 by targeting its 3'UTR. ERBB2 knockdown in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines suppressed, but miR-488 inhibition enhanced the cancer cell biological malignant behavior; the effects of miR-488 inhibition on pancreatic cancer cells were significantly reversed by ERBB2 knockdown. NF-ÎºB suppressed the expression of miR-488 transcriptionally via targeting its promoter region, consequentially repressing the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-488 upon pancreatic tumor cells. Thus, an NF-ÎºB/miR-488/ERBB2 axis modulating pancreatic cancer cell malignancy and tumor growth through cell cycle signaling was conclusively demonstrated.",-1
"Zinc oxide nanoparticles using plant Lawsonia inermis and their mosquitocidal, antimicrobial, anticancer applications showing moderate side effects","Microbes or parasites spread vector-borne diseases by mosquitoes without being affected themselves. Insecticides used in vector control produce a substantial problem for human health. This study synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using Lawsonia inermis L. and were characterized by UV-vis, FT-IR, SEM with EDX, and XRD analysis. Green synthesized ZnO NPs were highly toxic against Anopheles stephensi, whose lethal concentrations values ranged from 5.494 ppm (I instar), 6.801 ppm (II instar), 9.336 ppm (III instar), 10.736 ppm (IV instar), and 12.710 ppm (pupae) in contrast to L. inermis treatment. The predation efficiency of the teleost fish Gambusia affinis and the copepod Mesocyclops aspericornis against A. stephensi was not affected by exposure at sublethal doses of ZnO NPs. The predatory potency for G. affinis was 45 (I) and 25.83% (IV), copepod M. aspericornis was 40.66 (I) and 10.8% (IV) while in an ZnO NPs contaminated environment, the predation by the fish G. affinis was boosted to 71.33 and 34.25%, and predation of the copepod M. aspericornis was 60.35 and 16.75%, respectively. ZnO NPs inhibited the growth of several microbial pathogens including the bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and the fungi (Alternaria alternate and Aspergillus flavus), respectively. ZnO NPs decreased the cell viability of Hep-G2 with IC50 value of 21.63 Âµg/mL (R2 = 0.942; P < 0.001) while the concentration increased from 1.88 to 30 Âµg/mL. These outcomes support the use of L. inermis mediated ZnO NPs for mosquito control and drug development.",-1
Women's view on fasting during labor in a tertiary care obstetric unit. A prospective cohort study,"Objective:                    Maternal satisfaction and comfort may in part depend on fasting instruction given during labor. This study aimed to assess the satisfaction and the wishes of parturients with regards to fasting during labor.              Study design:                    This prospective cohort study was conducted among parturients assessing the fasting instructions they were given. We assessed whether women did have any oral intake during labor and focused on women's view of fasting during labor. Maternal discomfort related to thirst and hunger was assessed using 0-10 scales.              Results:                    A total of 193 women were included, among whom 71 (37 %) received spontaneously given instructions and 60 (31 %) received instruction upon request. One hundred sixteen (60 %) women were allowed to drink clear fluids, in a limited way for 106 women (91 % of those concerned); 119 women did drink clear fluids during labor. One hundred thirty-two (68 %) women had a thirst-related discomfort score â?4 without any statistical difference whether they had or had not drunk clear fluids. Colder water, unrestricted volume of water and sweet drink were desired by 74 (64 %), 38 (33 %) and 28 (24 %) women who had been allowed to drink, respectively.              Conclusion:                    These results emphasize that thirst contributes to maternal discomfort during labor. Permitting limited intake of water does not ensure high maternal satisfaction. Fresh clear fluids, unrestricted amounts of fluids and sweet fluids could contribute to improve maternal comfort.",-1
Beyond the Calorie Paradigm: Taking into Account in Practice the Balance of Fat and Carbohydrate Oxidation during Exercise?,"Recent literature shows that exercise is not simply a way to generate a calorie deficit as an add-on to restrictive diets but exerts powerful additional biological effects via its impact on mitochondrial function, the release of chemical messengers induced by muscular activity, and its ability to reverse epigenetic alterations. This review aims to summarize the current literature dealing with the hypothesis that some of these effects of exercise unexplained by an energy deficit are related to the balance of substrates used as fuel by the exercising muscle. This balance of substrates can be measured with reliable techniques, which provide information about metabolic disturbances associated with sedentarity and obesity, as well as adaptations of fuel metabolism in trained individuals. The exercise intensity that elicits maximal oxidation of lipids, termed LIPOXmax, FATOXmax, or FATmax, provides a marker of the mitochondrial ability to oxidize fatty acids and predicts how much fat will be oxidized over 45-60 min of low- to moderate-intensity training performed at the corresponding intensity. LIPOXmax is a reproducible parameter that can be modified by many physiological and lifestyle influences (exercise, diet, gender, age, hormones such as catecholamines, and the growth hormone-Insulin-like growth factor I axis). Individuals told to select an exercise intensity to maintain for 45 min or more spontaneously select a level close to this intensity. There is increasing evidence that training targeted at this level is efficient for reducing fat mass, sparing muscle mass, increasing the ability to oxidize lipids during exercise, lowering blood pressure and low-grade inflammation, improving insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, reducing blood glucose and HbA1c in type 2 diabetes, and decreasing the circulating cholesterol level. Training protocols based on this concept are easy to implement and accept in very sedentary patients and have shown an unexpected efficacy over the long term. They also represent a useful add-on to bariatric surgery in order to maintain and improve its weight-lowering effect. Additional studies are required to confirm and more precisely analyze the determinants of LIPOXmax and the long-term effects of training at this level on body composition, metabolism, and health.",-1
Agent-based modelling of complex factors impacting malaria prevalence,"Background:                    Increasingly complex models have been developed to characterize the transmission dynamics of malaria. The multiplicity of malaria transmission factors calls for a realistic modelling approach that incorporates various complex factors such as the effect of control measures, behavioural impacts of the parasites to the vector, or socio-economic variables. Indeed, the crucial impact of household size in eliminating malaria has been emphasized in previous studies. However, increasing complexity also increases the difficulty of calibrating model parameters. Moreover, despite the availability of much field data, a common pitfall in malaria transmission modelling is to obtain data that could be directly used for model calibration.              Methods:                    In this work, an approach that provides a way to combine in situ field data with the parameters of malaria transmission models is presented. This is achieved by agent-based stochastic simulations, initially calibrated with hut-level experimental data. The simulation results provide synthetic data for regression analysis that enable the calibration of key parameters of classical models, such as biting rates and vector mortality. In lieu of developing complex dynamical models, the approach is demonstrated using most classical malaria models, but with the model parameters calibrated to account for such complex factors. The performance of the approach is tested against a wide range of field data for Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) values.              Results:                    The overall transmission characteristics can be estimated by including various features that impact EIR and malaria incidence, for instance by reducing the mosquito-human contact rates and increasing the mortality through control measures or socio-economic factors.              Conclusion:                    Complex phenomena such as the impact of the coverage of the population with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), changes in behaviour of the infected vector and the impact of socio-economic factors can be included in continuous level modelling. Though the present work should be interpreted as a proof of concept, based on one set of field data only, certain interesting conclusions can already be drawn. While the present work focuses on malaria, the computational approach is generic, and can be applied to other cases where suitable in situ data is available.",-1
A Case for Systematic Quality Management in Mosquito Control Programmes in Europe,"The recent spread of invasive mosquito species, such as Aedes albopictus and the seasonal sporadic transmission of autochthonous cases of arboviral diseases (e.g., dengue, chikungunya, Zika) in temperate areas, such as Europe and North America, highlight the importance of effective mosquito-control interventions to reduce not only nuisance, but also major threats for public health. Local, regional, and even national mosquito control programs have been established in many countries and are executed on a seasonal basis by either public or private bodies. In order for these interventions to be worthwhile, funding authorities should ensure that mosquito control is (a) planned by competent scientific institutions addressing the local demands, (b) executed following the plan that is based on recommended and effective methods and strategies, (c) monitored regularly by checking the efficacy of the implemented actions, (d) evaluated against the set of targets, and (e) regularly improved according to the results of the monitoring. Adherence to these conditions can only be assured if a formal quality management system is adopted and enforced that ensures the transparency of effectiveness of the control operation. The current paper aims at defining the two components of this quality management system, quality assurance and quality control for mosquito control programs with special emphasis on Europe, but applicable over temperate areas.",-1
Intrapericardial Thymoma Presented as Pericardial Tamponade with Post-Operative Myasthenia Gravis,"Background:                    Thymoma is an epithelial mass arising from the thymus. Most thymomas are located in the anterior mediastinum. Ectopic intrapericardial thymoma is very unusual; to date, only eight cases of pericardial thymoma have been reported. Among thymoma patients, 20% to 25% are associated with myasthenia gravis. However, postoperative myasthenia gravis occurs in less than 1% of cases. Here, we share a rare case of ectopic intrapericardial thymoma that developed postoperative myasthenia gravis six months after surgery.              Case presentation:                    A 66-year-old woman visited the outpatient department due to productive cough and chest pain. Chest radiography showed increased soft tissue opacity over the mediastinum. A soft tissue mass in the pericardium and a ground glass nodule in right upper lung were noted using chest computed tomography. The diagnosis of thymoma, type B2, pT3N0M0, and stage IIIA and synchronous adenocarcinoma in situ of the right upper lung was confirmed after surgical removal. Six months later, the patient developed postoperative myasthenia gravis.              Conclusions:                    Thymoma is rarely considered a differential diagnosis in pericardial tumors. Surgical removal with adjuvant radiation therapy should be performed considering the malignancy potential of thymomas and cardiac complications. In patients without myasthenia gravis, a small chance of postoperative myasthenia gravis remains. Patients should be carefully monitored for myasthenia gravis after surgery.",-1
Reversing the miRNA -5p/-3p stoichiometry reveals physiological roles and targets of miR-140 miRNAs,"The chondrocyte-specific miR-140 miRNAs are necessary for normal endochondral bone growth in mice. miR-140 deficiency causes dwarfism and craniofacial deformity. However, the physiologically important targets of miR-140 miRNAs are still unclear. The miR-140 gene (Mir140) encodes three chondrocyte-specific microRNAs, miR-140-5p, derived from the 5' strand of primary miR-140, and miR140-3p.1 and -3p.2, derived from the 3' strand of primary miR-140. miR-140-3p miRNAs are 10 times more abundant than miR-140-5p likely due to the nonpreferential loading of miR-140-5p to Argonaute proteins. To differentiate the role of miR-140-5p and -3p miRNAs in endochondral bone development, two distinct mouse models, miR140-C > T, in which the first nucleotide of miR-140-5p was altered from cytosine to uridine, and miR140-CG, where the first two nucleotides of miR-140-3p were changed to cytosine and guanine, were created. These changes are expected to alter Argonaute protein loading preference of -5p and -3p to increase -5p loading and decrease -3p loading without changing the function of miR140-5p. These models presented a mild delay in epiphyseal development with delayed chondrocyte maturation. Using RNA-sequencing analysis of the two models, direct targets of miR140-5p, including Wnt11, were identified. Disruption of the predicted miR140-5p binding site in the 3' untranslated region of Wnt11 was shown to increase Wnt11 mRNA expression and caused a modest acceleration of epiphyseal development. These results show that the relative abundance of miRNA-5p and -3p can be altered by changing the first nucleotide of miRNAs in vivo, and this method can be useful to identify physiologically important miRNA targets.",-1
Aspects of Psychiatric Comorbidities in Breast Cancer Patients in Tertiary Hospitals Due to COVID-19 Outbreak in South Korea: A Single Center Longitudinal Cohort Study,"Background and Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of mental disorders in patients with breast cancer at Ajou University Hospital. In addition, the patterns and prevalence of mental disorders according to the occurrence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were analyzed. Materials and Methods: From 1 January 2008 to 30 June 2021, psychiatric disorders were identified in 5174 female patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Ajou University Hospital. Based on the time when COVID-19 occurred, the pattern of onset of mental disorders in patients with breast cancer was analyzed. In addition, the prevalence of mental disorders according to the time of breast cancer diagnosis and age was evaluated. Results: A year before the diagnosis of breast cancer, 371 patients were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Of these, 201 patients were diagnosed with stress and adjustment disorders, and 97 patients had anxiety disorders. The overall frequency of psychiatric disorders after breast cancer diagnosis peaked two months later. Among psychiatric disorders reported before the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of stress/adaptation disorders was 52%, and among psychiatric disorders reported after the pandemic, it was significantly higher at 94.7%. Anxiety was found to be high in the elderly group aged â?60 years, and the prevalence of stress and adjustment disorders tended to increase in the non-elderly group. Conclusions: Breast cancer patients showed different patterns of psychiatric disorders according to age, time of breast cancer diagnosis, and the occurrence of COVID-19. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, delays in treatment and anxiety about infection have increased the rate of stress and adjustment disorders in cancer patients. Mental health management during the pandemic and after cancer diagnosis can improve the quality of life of patients with cancer.",-1
MicroRNAs in Serum Exosomes as Circulating Biomarkers for Postmenopausal Osteoporosis,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is the most common skeletal disease in postmenopausal women and has become a global public health issue. Emerging evidence demonstrated the important relationship between microRNAs and PMOP. However, miRNAs have not yet been reported in PMOP. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the differences in miRNA expression profiles in PMOP with fragility fractures to identify the key circulating miRNAs in serum exosomes and to validate these molecules as potential biomarkers. Postmenopausal women with osteoporotic fracture and normal bone mass were enrolled. Serum exosomes were isolated by traditional differential ultracentrifugation from participants. Isolated exosomes were identified by electron microscopy, western blotting and nanoparticle-tracking analysis and then examined for exosomal small RNA sequencing. The expression of miRNAs was compared by sRNA deep sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Three miRNAs (mir-324-3p, mir-766-3p and mir-1247-5p) were found to be associated with BMD of L1-L4, FN (femur neck) and TH (total hip), while mir-330-5p and mir-3124-5p were associated with BMD of FN and TH. Furthermore, mir-330-5p was found to promote the ALP activity of hBMSCs, while mir-3124-5p showed the opposite result. The results showed that serum exosomal miRNAs were differentially expressed in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients with fragility fractures. Our study provides the first evidence that exosomal miRNA profiling revealed aberrant circulating miRNA in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Mir-324-3p, mir-766-3p, mir-1247-5p, mir-330-5p and mir-3124-5p, which were associated with bone mineral density (BMD), may serve as candidate diagnostic biomarkers as well as potentially contribute to pathophysiology of PMOP.",-1
The effects of inflammatory bowel disease on caregivers: significant burden and loss of productivity,"Background:                    Caregiver burden is the emotional, physical, practical, and/or financial burden associated with taking care of a patient with a chronic condition. Limited literature on caregiver burden in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) has accounted for some predictors, but its effect on work productivity (absenteeism and presenteeism) is unknown.              Methods:                    In a prospective study, patients and their respective caregivers were surveyed from November 2015 until July 2017. Data on demographics, work productivity, quality of life, disease activity, caregiver burden and productivity were collected. The burden on caregivers was assessed and associations between caregiver productivity and caregiver burden were analyzed. Additionally, predictors for caregiver burden were identified.              Results:                    One hundred two IBD patients and their respective caregiver were included. In total, 39% of IBD caregivers experienced burden. Caregivers with burden experienced significantly more absenteeism and presenteeism (65 and 85% respectively). Furthermore, 51% of caregivers felt that they should be doing more for their care recipient and felt they could do a better job at caregiving. Predictors of burden included race/ethnicity, history of fistulas, diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, higher caregiver education, and hours spent caregiving.              Conclusion:                    Caregivers with burden had significantly more productivity decrease compared to those without burden. Additionally, the majority of caregivers feel they should be providing more and better care for their recipients. The development of strategies to address caregiver's distress and perceived burden when caring for IBD patients is warranted.",-1
The Beneficial Effect of Probiotics Supplementation on Penicillin-Induced Focal Seizure in Rats,"The focal epilepsy is a chronic neurological brain disorder which affects millions of people in the world. There is emerging evidence that changes in the gut microbiota may have effects on epileptic seizures. In the present study, we examined the effect of probiotics on penicillin-induced focal seizure model in rats. Male Wistar Albino rats (n: 21) were randomly divided into three groups: control (no medication), penicillin and penicillin + probiotic. Probiotic VSL#3 (12.86 bn living bacteria/kg/day) was given by gavage for 30 days. The seizures were induced by intracortical injection of penicillin G (500 IU) into the cortex. An ECoG recordings were made for 180 min after penicillin G application. The spike frequency and the amplitude were used to assess the severity of seizures. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin (IL-6) levels in the brain were studied biochemically. Our results indicated that probiotic supplementation improved focal seizures through increasing the latency (p < 0.001) and decreasing the spike frequency (p < 0.01) compared to the penicillin group. Penicillin-induced seizure in rats significantly enhanced TNF-Î± (p < 0.01), NO (p < 0.01) and IL-6 (p < 0.05) compared to the control. Probiotic supplementation significantly decreased IL-6 (p < 0.05), TNF-Î± (p < 0.01) and NO (p < 0.001) compared to the penicillin group. When the body weights were compared before and after the experiment, there was no difference between the control and penicillin groups, but it was observed that the body weight decreased after probiotic supplementation in the penicillin + probiotic group. Probiotic supplementation may have anti-seizure effect by reducing proinflammatory cytokine and NO levels in epileptic rat brain.",-1
Convolutional Neural Network-Based Cross-Media Semantic Matching and User Adaptive Satisfaction Analysis Model,"In this paper, an in-depth study of cross-media semantic matching and user adaptive satisfaction analysis model is carried out based on the convolutional neural network. Based on the existing convolutional neural network, this paper uses rich information. The spatial correlation of cross-media semantic matching further improves the classification accuracy of hyperspectral images and reduces the classification time under user adaptive satisfaction complexity. Aiming at the problem that it is difficult for the current hyperspectral image classification method based on convolutional neural network to capture the spatial pose characteristics of objects, the problem is that principal component analysis ignores some vital information when retaining a few components. This paper proposes a polymorphism based on extension Attribute Profile Feature (EMAP) Stereo Capsule Network Model for Hyperspectral Image Classification. To ensure the model has good generalization performance, a new remote sensing image Pan sharpening algorithm based on convolutional neural network is proposed, which increases the model's width to extract the feature information of the image and uses dilated instead of traditional convolution. The experimental results show that the algorithm has good generalization while ensuring self-adaptive satisfaction.",-1
Difference in the frequency of pouchitis between ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis: is the explanation in peripouch fat?,"Aim:                    Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have an unexplained higher incidence of pouchitis and a greater amount of peripouch fat compared with patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The aims of this study were to compare the peripouch fat areas between patients with UC and patients with FAP, and to explore relationship between peripouch fat and pouchitis or chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis (CARP).              Method:                    Patients with an abdominal CT image from our prospectively maintained Pouch Database were included. Abdominal fat and peripouch fat were measured on CT images at different levels or planes. Comparisons of peripouch fat and CARP were performed before and after propensity score matching.              Results:                    A total of 277 patients with UC and 40 patients with FAP were included. Compared with patients with FAP, patients with UC were found to have a higher incidence of pouchitis (58.5% vs 15.0%, P < 0.001) and CARP (24.5% vs 2.5%, P = 0.002) and a higher total peripouch fat area (P = 0.030) and mesenteric peripouch fat area (P = 0.022) at Level-3. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that diagnosis (UC vs FAP) and peripouch fat areas at Level-3 and Level-5 were independent risk factors for CARP. With propensity score matching, 38 pairs of patients with UC and FAP were matched successfully. After matching, patients with UC were found to have higher total peripouch fat area and higher mesenteric peripouch fat area at Level-3, and a higher incidence of pouchitis (57.9% vs 13.2%, P < 0.001) and CARP (23.7% vs 2.6%, P = 0.007).              Conclusion:                    Our study demonstrates that patients with UC have more peripouch fat than those with FAP, which may explain the difference in the frequency of pouchitis and CARP between these groups of patients.",-1
Ecology and larval population dynamics of the primary malaria vector Nyssorhynchus darlingi in a high transmission setting dominated by fish farming in western Amazonian Brazil,"Vale do Rio JuruÃ¡ in western Acre, Brazil, is a persistent malaria transmission hotspot partly due to fish farming development that was encouraged to improve local standards of living. Fish ponds can be productive breeding sites for Amazonian malaria vector species, including Nyssorhynchus darlingi, which, combined with high human density and mobility, add to the local malaria burden.This study reports entomological profile of immature and adult Ny. darlingi at three sites in MÃ¢ncio Lima, Acre, during the rainy and dry season (February to September, 2017). From 63 fishponds, 10,859 larvae were collected, including 5,512 first-instar Anophelinae larvae and 4,927 second, third and fourth-instars, of which 8.5% (n = 420) were Ny. darlingi. This species was most abundant in not-abandoned fishponds and in the presence of emerging aquatic vegetation. Seasonal analysis of immatures in urban landscapes found no significant difference in the numbers of Ny. darlingi, corresponding to equivalent population density during the rainy to dry transition period. However, in the rural landscape, significantly higher numbers of Ny. darlingi larvae were collected in August (IRR = 5.80, p = 0.037) and September (IRR = 6.62, p = 0.023) (dry season), compared to February (rainy season), suggesting important role of fishponds for vector population maintenance during the seasonal transition in this landscape type. Adult sampling detected mainly Ny. darlingi (~93%), with similar outdoor feeding behavior, but different abundance according to landscape profile: urban site 1 showed higher peaks of human biting rate in May (46 bites/person/hour), than February (4) and September (15), while rural site 3 shows similar HBR during the same sampling period (22, 24 and 21, respectively). This study contributes to a better understanding of the larvae biology of the main malaria vector in the Vale do Rio JuruÃ¡ region and, ultimately will support vector control efforts.",-1
Transparency and Reproducibility of Meta-Analyses in Psychology: A Meta-Review,"Systematic review and meta-analysis are possible as viable research techniques only through transparent reporting of primary research; thus, one might expect meta-analysts to demonstrate best practice in their reporting of results and have a high degree of transparency leading to reproducibility of their work. This assumption has yet to be fully tested in the psychological sciences. We therefore aimed to assess the transparency and reproducibility of psychological meta-analyses. We conducted a meta-review by sampling 150 studies from Psychological Bulletin to extract information about each review's transparent and reproducible reporting practices. The results revealed that authors reported on average 55% of criteria and that transparent reporting practices increased over the three decades studied (b = 1.09, SE = 0.24, t = 4.519, p < .001). Review authors consistently reported eligibility criteria, effect-size information, and synthesis techniques. Review authors, however, on average, did not report specific search results, screening and extraction procedures, and most importantly, effect-size and moderator information from each individual study. Far fewer studies provided statistical code required for complete analytical replication. We argue that the field of psychology and research synthesis in general should require review authors to report these elements in a transparent and reproducible manner.",-1
Quantification of fat and skeletal muscle tissue at abdominal computed tomography: associations between single-slice measurements and total compartment volumes,"Purpose:                    Body composition is of great prognostic value in several severe diseases, including different types of cancer as well as cardiometabolic disorders. We aimed to investigate the correlations of skeletal muscle mass and abdominal adipose tissue compartments between volumetric and single-slice measurements to study the usefulness of several anatomical landmarks for estimation of total compartment volumes using abdominal CT-scans.              Methods:                    In this retrospective study volumetric quantifications of paraspinal skeletal muscles (SM) and adipose tissue compartments (visceral adipose tissue, VAT; subcutaneous adipose tissue, SAT) were performed in 50 consecutive patients (26 male; mean age, 63 Â± 15 years) who underwent abdominal multislice-CT for diagnostic purposes using an in-house software. Associations between total volumes of SM, VAT, and SAT with single-slice measurements at eight predefined anatomical landmarks (median intervertebral disk spaces T12/L1 to L5/S1; level of the umbilicus (U); level of the radix of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA)) were studied using correlation coefficients.              Results:                    Statistical analysis revealed a strong association between single-slice measurements of adipose tissue compartments with total VAT and SAT volume (VAT: all r > 0.89, P < 0.001; SAT: all r > 0.95, P < 0.001). The strongest associations with total SM volume were found for single-slice measurements obtained at L3/4 (r = 0.94, P < 0.001) and were further improved by normalization to height (r = 0.98, P < 0.001).              Conclusions:                    Single-slice measurements of SM, VAT, and SAT at several anatomical landmarks are strongly associated with total compartment volumes and therefore allow for easy and simultaneous assessment of skeletal muscle mass and adipose tissue compartment volumes.",-1
"Ivermectin Treatment for Cattle Reduced the Survival of Two Malaria Vectors, Anopheles dirus and Anopheles epiroticus, Under Laboratory Conditions in Central Vietnam","Ivermectin is a low-cost and nontoxic mosquitocide that may have a role in malaria elimination. However, the extent to which this drug impacts the mortality of Anopheles dirus and Anopheles epiroticus, two important malaria vectors in Southeast Asia, is unknown. This study compared and quantified anopheline mortality after feeding on ivermectin-treated cattle and control cattle in Vietnam. Local anopheline colonies fed on cattle 1 to 3, 6 to 8, 13 to 15, 20 to 22, and 28 to 30 days after injection (DAI) with ivermectin (intervention) or saline (control). An. dirus that fed on ivermectin-treated cattle had higher mortality rates than controls for up to 20 DAI (P < 0.05); An. epiroticus that fed on ivermectin-treated cattle had consistently higher mortality rates than controls for up to 8 DAI (P < 0.05). Feeding on ivermectin-treated cattle increased the mortality rate of these vector species for biologically relevant time periods. Therefore, ivermectin has the potential to become an important tool for integrated vector management.",-1
Newly identified set of obesity-related genotypes and abdominal fat influence the risk of insulin resistance in a Korean population,"We aimed to identify obesity-related single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in a Korean population and construct an obesity genetic risk score (GRS) to examine the association of the genetic predisposition to obesity with insulin resistance (IR). In total, 9675 subjects were included, and 7666 of these subjects were used for replication. A GRS was constructed using the SNP loci that overlapped in both cohort sets. The subjects showed a trend toward an increase in body mass index, waist circumference, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR, HOMA-B, and levels of insulin, triglyceride, and alanine aminotransferase across the tertiles of obesity GRS, while the adiponectin level showed a trend toward a decrease with increasing GRS. The associations between the obesity GRS and the measures of fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and adiponectin were significant after adjusting for confounding factors. Moreover, a significant association between obesity GRS and HOMA-IR was observed in subjects with abdominal obesity. The present results indicate that a predisposition to obesity may affect IR in the Korean population and that abdominal fat may alter or modify the genetic effects. Furthermore, the set of obesity-related genotypes and abdominal fat may play interactive roles in determining the risk of IR.",-1
"Using machine learning to predict health-related quality of life outcomes in patients with low grade glioma, meningioma, and acoustic neuroma","Background:                    Predicting reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after resection of a benign or low-grade brain tumour provides the opportunity for early intervention, and targeted expenditure of scarce supportive care resources. We aimed to develop, and evaluate the performance of, machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict HRQoL outcomes in this patient group.              Methods:                    Using a large prospective dataset of HRQoL outcomes in patients surgically treated for low grade glioma, acoustic neuroma and meningioma, we investigated the capability of ML to predict a) HRQoL-impacting symptoms persisting between 12 and 60 months from tumour resection and b) a decline in global HRQoL by more than the minimum clinically important difference below a normative population mean within 12 and 60 months after resection. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to measure the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of models. Six ML algorithms were explored per outcome: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, K Neighbours Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting Machine.              Results:                    The final cohort included 262 patients. Outcome measures for which AUC>0.9 were Appetite loss, Constipation, Nausea and vomiting, Diarrhoea, Dyspnoea and Fatigue. AUC was between 0.8 and 0.9 for global HRQoL and Financial difficulty. Pain and Insomnia achieved AUCs below 0.8. PR-AUCs were similar overall to the AUC of each respective classifier.              Conclusions:                    ML algorithms based on routine demographic and perioperative data show promise in their ability to predict HRQoL outcomes in patients with low grade and benign brain tumours between 12 and 60 months after surgery.",-1
"Quantification of Liver, Subcutaneous, and Visceral Adipose Tissues by MRI Before and After Bariatric Surgery","Background:                    Morbid obesity is a worldwide epidemic and is increasingly treated by bariatric surgery. Fatty liver is a common finding; almost half of all patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis develop steatohepatitis. Bariatric surgery improves steatohepatitis documented by liver biopsy and single voxel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.              Objective:                    To investigate changes before and after bariatric surgery using whole organ MRI quantification of liver, visceral, and subcutaneous fat.              Setting:                    University of Basel Hospital and St. Clara Research Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.              Methods:                    Sixteen morbidly obese patients were evaluated by abdominal MRI-scanning before and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after bariatric surgery to measure percentage liver fat (%-LF), total liver volume (TLV) and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and SAT). Fasting plasma samples were taken for measurement of glucose, insulin, blood lipids, and liver biomarkers. In a control group of 12 healthy lean volunteers, the liver biomarker was also measured.              Results:                    The reproducibility of fat quantification by use of MRI was excellent. LF decreased significantly faster than VAT and SAT (%-LF vs. VAT p < 0.001 and %-LF vs. SAT p < 0.001). At certain time points, %-LF, VAT, and SAT were associated with changes in blood lipids and insulin.              Conclusions:                    MRI quantification offers excellently reproducible results in measurement of liver fat and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. Liver fat decreased significantly faster than visceral or subcutaneous adipose tissue. Decrease in %-LF and VAT is associated with decrease in total cholesterol, LDL, and plasma insulin.",-1
The Effects of Intermittent Fasting Combined with Resistance Training on Lean Body Mass: A Systematic Review of Human Studies,"Diets utilising intermittent fasting (IF) as a strategic method to manipulate body composition have recently grown in popularity, however, dietary practices involving fasting have also been followed for centuries for religious reasons (i.e., Ramadan). Regardless of the reasons for engaging in IF, the impacts on lean body mass (LBM) may be detrimental. Previous research has demonstrated that resistance training promotes LBM accrual, however, whether this still occurs during IF is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this review is to systematically analyse human studies investigating the effects of variations of IF combined with resistance training on changes in LBM in previously sedentary or trained (non-elite) individuals. Changes in body weight and fat mass, and protocol adherence were assessed as a secondary objective. This review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and SportDiscus databases were searched for articles investigating IF, combined with resistance training that reported measures of body composition. Eight studies met the eligibility criteria. LBM was generally maintained, while one study reported a significant increase in LBM. Body fat mass or percentage was significantly reduced in five of eight studies. Results suggest that IF paired with resistance training generally maintains LBM, and can also promote fat loss. Future research should examine longer-term effects of various forms of IF combined with resistance training compared to traditional forms of energy restriction.

Discrimination of secondary hypsarrhythmias to Zika virus congenital syndrome and west syndrome based on joint moments and entropy measurements,"Hypsarrhythmia is a specific chaotic morphology, present in the interictal period of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal in patients with West Syndrome (WS), a severe form of childhood epilepsy and that, recently, was also identified in the examinations of patients with Zika Virus Congenital Syndrome (ZVCS). This innovative work proposes the development of a computational methodology for analysis and differentiation, based on the time-frequency domain, between the chaotic pattern of WS and ZVCS hypsarrhythmia. The EEG signal time-frequency analysis is carried out from the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Four joint moments-joint mean-[Formula: see text], joint variance-[Formula: see text], joint skewness-[Formula: see text], and joint kurtosis-[Formula: see text]-and four entropy measurements-Shannon, Log Energy, Norm, and Sure-are obtained from the CWT to compose the representative feature vector of the EEG hypsarrhythmic signals under analysis. The performance of eight classical types of machine learning algorithms are verified in classification using the k-fold cross validation and leave-one-patient-out cross validation methods. Discrimination results provided 78.08% accuracy, 85.55% sensitivity, 73.21% specificity, and AUC = 0.89 for the ANN classifier.",-1
Oral Administration of Nanopeptide CMCS-20H Conspicuously Boosts Immunity and Precautionary Effect Against Bacterial Infection in Fish,"Massive mortalities caused by bacterial infections in intensive aquaculture result in serious economic losses. In this study, a novel antimicrobial peptide gcIFN-20H was efficiently expressed in Pichia pastoris (GS115) and loaded on carboxylmethyl chitosan (CMCS) to prepare CMCS-20H nanoparticles. Through physical characterization assays (TEM, DLS, BCA, and Raman) and biological activity tests (antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity), CMCS-20H nanopeptide was verified to be spherical nanoparticles with sustained release, antimicrobial activity, and negligible toxicity. CMCS-20H nanoparticles are more resistant to intestinal degradation than unloaded gcIFN-20H by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Oral administration was then carried out for 42 days. Complement C3 content, lysozyme, and total superoxide dismutase activities are highest in CMCS-20H group by serum biochemistry index assays. After challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila, the survival rate in CMCS-20H group is highest (46%), which is 64% higher than the control group (28%). Meanwhile, the tissue bacterial loads (intestine, spleen, head kidney, trunk kidney, hepatopancreas, muscle, and blood) in the CMCS-20H group are significantly lower than other groups. By PAS staining analysis, the number of intestinal villi goblet cells and the thickness of mucin in the CMCS-20H group obviously increased. CMCS-20H effectively enhances mRNA expressions of some important immune genes (IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, IL-2, IFN-Î³2, and IgM). The minimal tissue lesions (Intestine, spleen, and trunk kidney) were seen in the CMCS-20H group by histopathological examination. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that oral CMCS-20H maintains the intestinal microbiome homeostasis in bacterial infection. The results indicate that the novel nanopeptide CMCS-20H as the immunopotentiator can remarkably boost fish immunity and precautionary effect by oral administration and address the theoretical mechanisms and insights into the promising application prospect in aquaculture.",-1
Polysaccharide from Agrocybe cylindracea prevents diet-induced obesity through inhibiting inflammation mediated by gut microbiota and associated metabolites,"Polysaccharide from Agrocybe cylindracea (ACP) has been demonstrated with various health benefits, but its anti-obesity effect and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of ACP in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice by targeting gut microbiota and metabolites. 9-week ACP supplementation in HFD-fed mice reduced body weight, adipose accumulation, impaired insulin resistance, lipid levels, and liver injuries, which were negatively correlated to the pro-inflammatory factors, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin- 6 (IL-6). Moreover, ACP not only restored HFD-induced gut disorder, as indicated by the depletion of Desulfovibrio and Oscillibacter and the enrichment of the Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Butyricimonas, and Dubosiella, but also positively regulated gut metabolites such as solavetivone and N-acetylneuraminic acid. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that the ACP-altered microbes and metabolites were highly correlated with inflammation-related indexes. Notably, ACP greatly lowered the obesity-related TNF-Î±- and IL-6-levels partially by reducing Desulfovibrio and increasing Parabacteroides abundances, together with the associated decrease of solavetivone level. These findings suggest that ACP may be used as a prebiotic agent to prevent diet-induced obesity, and target-specific microbiota and metabolites may have unique therapeutic promise for inflammation-related diseases.",-1
New traps for the capture of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) eggs and adults,"The control of arboviruses carried by Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) can be performed with tools that monitor and reduce the circulation of these vectors. Therefore, the efficiency of four types of traps in capturing A. aegypti and A. albopictus eggs and adults, with the biological product Vectobac WG, was evaluated in the field. For this, 20 traps were installed in two locations, which were in the South (Londrina, ParanÃ¡) and North (Manaus, Amazonas) Regions of Brazil, from March to April 2017 and January to February 2018, respectively. The UELtrap-E (standard trap) and UELtrap-EA traps captured A. aegypti and A. albopictus eggs: 1703/1866 eggs in Londrina, and 10268/2149 eggs in Manaus, respectively, and presented high ovitraps positivity index (OPI) values (averages: 100%/100% in Londrina, and 100%/96% in Manaus, respectively); and high egg density index (EDI) values (averages: 68/75 in Londrina, and 411/89 in Manaus, respectively), so they had statistically superior efficiency to that of the CRtrap-E and CRtrap-EA traps in both regions, that captured less eggs and adults: 96/69 eggs in Londrina, and 1091/510 eggs in Manaus, respectively. Also presented lower OPI values (averages: 28%/4% in Londrina, and 88%/60% in Manaus, respectively); and lower EDI values (averages: 10.5/9 in Londrina, and 47/30 in Manaus, respectively). The capture ratios of Aedes adults in the UELtrap-EA and CRtrap-EA traps in Londrina and Manaus were 53.3%/29.5% and 0%/9.8%, respectively. UELtrap-EA can be adopted as efficient tool for Aedes monitoring due to their high sensitivity, low cost and ease of use.",-1
Quantitative Changes in White Blood Cells: Correlation with the Hallmarks of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"Background and Objectives: In women of reproductive age, leukocytosis is a risk factor that bridges low-grade chronic inflammation (metabolic inflammation), metabolic changes, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and is a potential early predictor of PCOS. This study aims to explore the predictive role of quantitative changes in white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophils in PCOS-associated metabolic changes. Materials and Methods: A total number of 176 blood samples were obtained from age-matched women of the reproductive period, comprising 88 PCOS cases and 88 healthy controls. Hematological, metabolic, and anthropometric indices and ultrasonic assessment were recorded. Results: Elevated levels of luteinizing hormone, testosterone, and lipid parameters except HDL-C levels, and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in PCOS were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The neutrophil count and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in PCOS patients were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than their counterparts. The predictive ability of the neutrophil count and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for PCOS, and possibly its associating subclinical inflammation at optimum cut-off values for the neutrophil count and NLR of &gt;46.62% (sensitivity 94.32% and specificity 74.42%) and &gt;1.23 (sensitivity 71.59% and specificity 100%), respectively. With regard to the areas under the curve (AUC) and Youden indices, they constituted 0.922 and 0.697 for neutrophil count and 0.926 and 0.716 for NLR, respectively. The comparative ROC z-statistic value was 2.222 and a p = 0.026. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed no significant influence for hormonal and metabolic independent variables on the neutrophil count in PCOS cases, but, as can be expected, revealed a significant negative relationship with the other components of WBCs. Conclusion: In conclusion, relative neutrophilia and elevated NLR are potential cost-effective, sensitive, and specific predictors of PCOS that may also shed light on the mechanism of chronic low-grade inflammation that is characteristic of the disease.",-1
Downregulation of Kcnq1ot1 attenuates Î²-cell proliferation and insulin secretion via the miR-15b-5p/Ccnd1 and Ccnd2 axis,"Aim:                    To examine the effect of lncRNA Kcnq1ot1 on pancreatic Î² cells in the development of diabetes.              Methods:                    The expression levels of Kcnq1ot1 were detected in the islets of diabetes mouse models and the serum of patients with type 2 diabetes by qRT-PCR. CCK8, Ki67 staining, immunohistochemical analyses, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test were performed to detect the effect of Kcnq1ot1 on Î²-cell proliferation and insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo. The relationship between Kcnq1ot1 and miR-15b-5p was predicted by bioinformatics prediction, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay.              Results:                    Kcnq1ot1 was more abundant in the pancreas. The expression of Kcnq1ot1 was decreased in the islets of db/db mice and diet-induced obese mice and in the serum of patients with type 2 diabetes. Silencing Kcnq1ot1 inhibited the Î²-cell proliferation concomitant with a reduction in the levels of Ccnd1 and Ccnd2. Insulin synthesis and secretion were impaired, along with the decreased expression of Ins1, Ins2, and insulin-related transcription factors. Moreover, Kcnq1ot1 knockdown in vivo reduced glucose tolerance and decreased insulin secretion, consistent with the reduction in the relative islet area and Ki67-positive Î²-cells detected by immunochemistry and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Mechanistically, Kcnq1ot1 directly targeted miR-15b-5p which regulated Î²-cell proliferation and insulin secretion through Ccnd1 and Ccnd2. Notably, the suppression of miR-15b-5p attenuated the inhibition of Min6 proliferation and insulin production induced by Kcnq1ot1 knockdown.              Conclusion:                    Kcnq1ot1 regulated Î²-cell proliferation and insulin secretion via the miR-15b-5p/Ccnd1 and Ccnd2 axis, which is worthy of further investigation considering its potential in diabetes treatment.",-1
Viscus fat area contributes to the Framingham 10-year general cardiovascular disease risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Objective:                    To explore the correlation of the viscus fat area (VFA) with the Framingham 10-year general cardiovascular disease risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).              Methods:                    A total of 202 patients with T2DM were divided into two groups based on VFA (a VFA â?100 cm2 group and a VFA < 100 cm2 group), or four groups based on sex and age (a middle-aged male group, an elderly male group, a middle-aged female group, and an elderly female group). The correlation between the Framingham 10-year general cardiovascular disease risk and body fat indexes was analyzed.              Results:                    Patients in the VFA â?100 cm2 group had higher body fat indexes and Framingham Risk Scores (FRSs) and lower levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) when compared to the VFA < 100 cm2 group (P < 0.05). Female patients had higher body fat mass (BFM) and body fat percentage (BFP) levels and a lower VFA when compared to male patients. The VFA was significantly higher in the elderly than in the middle-aged patients. The waist hip fat ratio (WHFR) was significantly higher in elderly females than in elderly males (P < 0.05). Elderly females had the highest FRS of all patients. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the VFA as a contributor to the Framingham 10-year general cardiovascular disease risk after statistical correction for other multiple factors affecting cardiovascular disease risk.              Conclusion:                    The VFA is an independent factor that contributes to the Framingham 10-year general cardiovascular disease risk in patients with T2DM.",-1
Endothelium-Derived Factors Influence Differentiation of Fat-Derived Stromal Cells Post-Exercise in Subjects with Prediabetes,"Purpose: We investigated the effect of aerobic and resistance exercise on abdominal subcutaneous fat-derived stromal cells in middle-aged subjects with prediabetes, pre- and post-exercise to establish molecular mechanisms that drive the effect of exercise. Methods: Five subjects, aged between 40 and 60 years with a body mass index between 25 and 39.9 kg/m2 and with prediabetes, were enrolled in a 12-week exercise intervention program. Biophysical parameters were assessed pre- and post-exercise. Stromal cells were obtained from subcutaneous abdominal fat and cultured for 2-3 weeks. The stromal cells were then analyzed for mRNA analysis pre- and post-exercise. This was followed up with in vitro experiments where commercially obtained human fat-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were exposed to adipogenic media, and conditioned media from human endothelial conditioned media (ECM) cells were added to note if ECM addition altered adipogenesis. Subsequently, MSC differentiation was monitored by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Post-exercise, subjects' cardiometabolic parameters improved. MSC obtained at post-exercise phase, from subcutaneous fat biopsies, on RT-PCR analysis, showed upregulation of antioxidant, mitochondrial, glucose transporter, and genes associated with osteogenesis compared with pre-exercise MSC mRNA. A concomitant increase in plasma osteocalcin levels was also noted post-exercise. In vitro, MSCs exposed to adipogenic differentiation media with the addition of ECM showed a significant reduction in expression of adipogenic marker genes and instead showed upregulation of genes associated with osteogenic differentiation. Conclusions: Exercise appears to prevent adipogenic differentiation of fat-derived stromal cells and promote osteogenic differentiation, in prediabetic middle-aged subjects. Interestingly, the addition of endothelium-derived factors to adipogenic media also appears to prevent adipogenic differentiation of commercially obtained fat-derived stromal cells and promotes osteogenic differentiation. Both in vivo and in vitro findings emphasize the paracrine effect of endothelium-derived factors on fat differentiation.",-1
Evaluation of Nursing Effect of Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation Training on Pelvic Organ Prolapse in Postpartum Pregnant Women under Ultrasound Imaging with Artificial Intelligence Algorithm,"This study was aimed at exploring the application value of ultrasound technology and rehabilitation training based on artificial intelligence algorithm in postpartum recovery of pelvic organ prolapse. Sixty patients diagnosed as mild and moderate pelvic organ prolapse by pelvic organ prolapse quantification evaluation were selected as the research objects. The patients were randomly divided into experimental group (30 cases) and control group (30 cases). The patients in the control group were given routine guidance and postpartum health education 42 days after delivery and given no pelvic floor rehabilitation training, waiting for natural recovery. 42 days after delivery, the patients in the experimental group received pelvic floor rehabilitation training based on the patients in the control group. All patients underwent ultrasonography, the convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm was used for image denoising and edge feature extraction, and the performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the Dice coefficient, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and Hausdorff distance. The thickness of levator ani muscle, anterior and posterior diameter of perineal hiatus, pelvic floor muscle strength, and imaging data were compared between the two groups. The results revealed that the thickness of levator ani muscle in the experimental group was significantly greater than that in the control group after one month and three months of treatment (0.633 Â± 0.26 cm vs. 0.519 Â± 0.234 cm, 0.7 Â± 0.214 cm vs. 0.507 Â± 0.168 cm, P < 0.05). After one month and three months of treatment, the anterior and posterior diameter of perineal fissure in the experimental group was obviously smaller than that in the control group (4.76 Â± 0.513 cm vs. 5.002 Â± 0.763 cm, 4.735 Â± 0.614 cm vs. 4.987 Â± 0.581 cm, P < 0.05). The pelvic floor muscle strength of the experimental group was remarkably higher than that of the control group after one month and three months of treatment (3.183 Â± 1.47 vs. 2.41 Â± 1.57, 3.365 Â± 1.53 vs. 2.865 Â± 1.69, P < 0.05). The ultrasonic image was clearer, the focus was more prominent, and the image quality was significantly improved after being processed by artificial intelligence algorithm. The Dice coefficient, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and Hausdorff distance of the proposed algorithm were better than those of the traditional algorithm. Thus, artificial intelligence algorithm had a good effect in ultrasonic image processing. Pelvic floor rehabilitation training had a good effect on postpartum nursing of patients with pelvic organ prolapse.",-1
"Hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-182-5p, and hsa-miR-26a-5p as potential biomarkers for BCR-ABL1 among adult chronic myeloid leukemia treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors at the molecular response","Background:                    Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line therapy for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) show a high success rate. However, a low number of patients with long-term treatment-free remission (TFR) were observed. Molecular relapse after imatinib discontinuation occurred at 50% at 24 months, with 80% occurrence within the first 6 months. One of the reasons for relapse is untimely TKIs discontinuation caused by large errors from estimates at very low-level or undetectable disease, thus warranting new biomarkers for CML.              Methods:                    Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) at the molecular response in CML adult patients receiving TKIs treatment. A total of 86 samples were collected, 30 from CML patients responsive and 28 from non-responsive to imatinib therapy, and 28 from blood donors. NGS was conducted whereby 18 miRNAs were selected and validated by real-time RT-qPCR in triplicate.              Results:                    Hsa-miR-181a-5p was expressed significantly (p-value< 0.05) with 2.14 and 2.33-fold down-regulation in both patient groups, respectively meanwhile hsa-miR-182-5p and hsa-miR-26a-5p were significant only in the non-responsive group with 2.08 and 2.39 fold up-regulation. The down-regulation was consistent with decreased amounts of BCR-ABL1 in patients taking TKIs regardless of molecular responses. The up-regulation was consistent with the substantial presence of BCR-ABL1 in CML patients treated with TKIs at the molecular response.              Conclusions:                    Therefore, these miRNAs have potential as new therapeutic biomarkers for BCR-ABL1 status in adult CML patients treated with TKIs at molecular responses. These could improve current approaches and require further analysis to look for targets of these miRNAs in CML.",-1
Neuro-Inflammatory Response and Brain-Peripheral Crosstalk in Sepsis and Stroke,"Despite recent therapeutic advances, ischemic stroke is still a leading cause of death and disability. There is renewed attention on peripheral inflammatory signaling as a way of modulating the post-ischemic neuro-inflammatory process. The immune-brain crosstalk has long been the focus for understanding the mechanisms of sickness behavior, which is an adaptive autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral response to a peripheral inflammation. It is mediated by humoral and neural pathways that mainly involve the circumventricular organs and vagal nerve, respectively. In this review we address the question of how sepsis and stroke can dysregulate this adaptive response, notably by impairing the central integration of peripheral signaling, but also by efferent control of the immune response. We highlight the potential role of gut-brain and brain-spleen signaling in stroke.",-1
Contralateral Posterior Putaminal 18 F-Fluorodopa Uptake in Mild Stage Parkinson's Disease: A PET/CT Study,"Objective:                    Previous studies revealed that 18F-FDOPA uptake was significantly decreased in the subregions of striatum contralateral to the side with predominant symptoms and was helpful for improving the early diagnostic accuracy of PD. However, in these studies, more than half of the PD patients already have bilateral motor symptoms (mH&Y stageâ?). This study was aimed to extend previous findings to a milder disease stage.              Methods:                    Sixteen PD patients with only mild and unilateral motor symptoms (mH&Y stage=1 and disease durationâ? years) and 22 healthy controls were involved. Striatal 18F-FDOPA uptake was analyzed using a ratio approach.              Results:                    The SORs in the subregions of the contralateral striatum, including caudate, anterior putamen and posterior putamen were significantly decreased in the mild stage PD patients. The SOR for the contralateral posterior putamen had the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.963) and separated mild stage PD patients from healthy controls with a sensitivity of 93.75% and a specificity of 95.45% when the cut-off value of <2.160 was selected.              Conclusion:                    These data indicate that contralateral posterior putaminal 18F-FDOPA uptake may represent a potential marker for early diagnosis of PD, especially in patients with only mild and unilateral motor symptoms.",-1
Clinical Characteristics of Bloodstream Infection in Immunosuppressed Patients: A 5-Year Retrospective Cohort Study,"Introduction:                    Immunosuppressed patients with bloodstream infection are at risk of mortality. Our objective was to assess the independent risk factors of bloodstream infection with mortality in immunosuppressive states.              Methods:                    The medical data of a total of 896 patients who were hospitalized in our hospital were collected from January 2015 to December 2019. Evaluation of the independent risk factors of mortality was done by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.              Results:                    Of the 896 immunosuppressed patients with bloodstream infection, 698 had over 60-day survivals and 198 had 60-day mortality. In our study, PCT (mean Â±; standard: 11.40 Â±; 31.89 Âµg/l vs. 62.45 Â±; 17.10 Âµg/l, p = 0.007) and presence of age >60 years (40% vs. 14.19%, p = 0.001) were significantly different between situations with and without 60-day survivals in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Age >60 years and PCT could be used as indicators for bloodstream infection with 60-day death in immunosuppressive states; the OR (95% CI) were 1.532 (1.099-2.135) and 2.063 (1.413-3.013), respectively. In different subgroups, PCT and age were also independent risk factors of blood system diseases, Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, diabetes, and ICU-stay subgroups.              Conclusions:                    Age and PCT were independently associated with mortality in immunosuppressive states, which may help to identify the highly risky situation of bloodstream infection in immunosuppressive states.",-1
Functions of animal microRNA-encoded peptides: the race is on!,"Short open reading frame (sORF)-encoded peptides (SEPs) recently emerged as new key players in biology. Pioneering work first established that sORFs encoded by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are efficiently translated and produce functional peptides. In plants, primary transcripts of microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) also produce sORF-encoded peptides called miPEPs, which are involved in specific transcriptional autoregulatory feedback loops (Lauressergues et al, 2015). To what extend are such mechanisms conserved in other species, especially in animals? In this issue of EMBO reports, Zhou et al show that pri-miR-31 encodes a miPEP promoting Treg differentiation and downregulating pri-miR-31 expression (Zhou et al, 2022).",-1
Early Feeding in Acute Pancreatitis in Children: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background:                    Studies have increasingly challenged the traditional management of acute pancreatitis (AP) with bowel rest. However, these studies used a low-fat diet or transgastric feeding and only included adults. Aiming to generate higher-quality prospective pediatric data, we compared the traditional approach of fasting and intravenous fluids and early enteral feeding with standard diet or formula.              Methods:                    Randomized controlled trial of children (2-18 years) with mild-moderate AP. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to initial fasting and intravenous fluids or an immediate, unrestricted diet. Pain scores, blood measures, and cross-sectional imaging were recorded throughout admission and follow-up. The primary outcome was time to discharge, and secondary outcomes were clinical and biochemical resolution and local and systemic complication rates.              Results:                    Of 33 patients (17 [52%] boys, mean age of 11.5 [Â±4.8] years), 18 (55%) were randomly assigned to early feeding and 15 (45%) were randomly assigned to initial fasting. We recorded the median (interquartile range [IQR]) time to discharge (2.6 [IQR 2.0 to 4.0] vs 2.9 [IQR 1.8 to 5.6]; P = .95), reduction in serum lipase levels by day 2 (58% [IQR 2% to 85%] vs 48% [IQR 3% to 71%]; P = .65), and readmission rates (1 of 18 [6%] vs 2 of 15 [13%]; P = .22) between the early feeding and fasting cohorts, respectively. Immediate or delayed complication rates did not differ. Patients randomly assigned to early feeding had weight gain of 1.3 kg (IQR 0.29 to 3.6) at follow-up, compared with weight loss of 0.8 kg (IQR -2.1 to 0.7) in fasted patients (P = .028).              Conclusions:                    This is the first randomized controlled trial in pediatric AP. There was no difference between early commencement of a standard oral diet and initial fast in any of the major outcome measures.",-1
"Genipin, an Inhibitor of UCP2 as a Promising New Anticancer Agent: A Review of the Literature","Genipin is a protein cross-linking agent extracted from Gardenia (Gardenia jasminoides Ellis) fruits. This fruit has conventionally been used as a Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of inflammation and jaundice and as an edible colorant in oriental countries. Uncoupling protein (UCP)-2 is a member of the family of uncoupling proteins, which are anion transporters positioned in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Genipin has been shown to have hepatoprotective activity, acting as an effective antioxidant and inhibitor of mitochondrial UCP2, and is also reported to exert significant anticancer effects. In this review, the author presents the latest progress of genipin as an anticancer agent and concisely describes its various mechanisms of action. In brief, genipin inhibits UCP2 to attenuate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to ROS/c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. Genipin also increases the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-2, a kind of tumor promoter in a variety of cancers, as well as induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that genipin can serve as a promising novel antitumor agent that could be applicable for chemotherapy and/or chemoprevention for cancers.",-1
"How does 6 months of active bike commuting or leisure-time exercise affect insulin sensitivity, cardiorespiratory fitness and intra-abdominal fat? A randomised controlled trial in individuals with overweight and obesity","Objectives:                    To evaluate effects of active bike commuting or leisure-time exercise of two intensities on peripheral insulin sensitivity (primary outcome), cardiorespiratory fitness and intra-abdominal adipose tissue mass (secondary outcomes).              Methods:                    188 physically inactive, healthy women and men (20-45 years) with overweight or class 1 obesity were recruited. In the 6-month trial, 130 participants were randomised to either: no intervention (CON), active commuting (BIKE) or leisure-time exercise of moderate (MOD, 50% VO2peak) or vigorous (VIG, 70% VO2peak) intensity. 100 completed follow-up testing. Exercise prescription was 5 days/week with a weekly exercise energy expenditure of 1600 kcal for women and 2100 kcal for men. Testing was performed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.              Results:                    Peripheral insulin sensitivity (ml/min/pmol insulin/L) increased (improved) by 24% (95% CI 6% to 46%, p=0.01) in VIG compared with CON at 3 months. Peripheral insulin sensitivity increased (improved) by 20% in BIKE (95% CI 1% to 43%, p=0.04) and 26% in VIG (95% CI 7% to 47%, p<0.01) compared with CON at 6 months. Cardiorespiratory fitness increased in all exercise groups compared with CON at 6 months; but the increase was higher in those that undertook vigorous exercise than those who did moderate exercise. Intra-abdominal adipose tissue mass diminished across all exercise groups in comparison to CON at 6 months.              Conclusions:                    Active bike commuting improved cardiometabolic health; as did leisure-time exercise. Leisure-time exercise of vigorous intensity conferred more rapid effects on peripheral insulin sensitivity as well as additional effects on cardiorespiratory fitness than did moderate intensity exercise.              Trial registration:        NCT01962259.",-1
Pubertal Development: What's Normal/What's Not,"Onset of puberty, as defined by breast stage 2, appears to be starting at younger ages since the 1940s. There is an ongoing controversy regarding what is normative, as well as what is normal, and the evaluation that is deemed necessary for girls maturing before 8 years of age. There are potential implications of earlier pubertal timing, including psychosocial consequences during adolescence, as well as longer term risks, such as breast cancer and cardiometabolic risks. There are additional consequences derived from slower pubertal tempo, for age of menarche has not decreased as much as age of breast development; these include longer interval between sexual initiation and intentional childbearing, as well as a broadened window of susceptibility to endocrine-related cancers.",-1
Influence of Pyrethroid Resistance on Vector Competency for Zika Virus by Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae),"The vector competence of mosquitoes for pathogens has been shown to be influenced by the status of insecticide resistance in the mosquito population. However, to date, only two studies has explored the impact of insecticide resistance on arbovirus transmission. The global and widespread use of pyrethroids has led to the development of insecticide resistance in many mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Culicidae), the primary vector of Zika virus. Strains of Ae. aegypti that were genetically similar, but responded differently to pyrethroid exposure, were developed using backcrossing techniques. These populations were orally infected with Zika virus and susceptibility to infection, disseminated infection, and transmission potential were evaluated. Analyses revealed differences in susceptibility to infection and disseminated infection between the pyrethroid susceptible and resistant strains of Ae. aegypti during the infection period. Here, we identify an additional challenge to that of widespread pyrethroid resistance. Specifically, resistance is associated with altered phenotypic traits that influence susceptibility to arbovirus infection and progression of infection in the mosquito, factors which ultimately influence risk of arbovirus transmission. These findings support the need to 1) consider insecticide resistance status during times of arbovirus transmission and 2) to implement insecticide resistance management/ mitigation strategies in vector control programs.",-1
Assessment of data consistency through cascades of independently recurrent inference machines for fast and robust accelerated MRI reconstruction,"Objective.Machine Learning methods can learn how to reconstruct magnetic resonance images (MRI) and thereby accelerate acquisition, which is of paramount importance to the clinical workflow. Physics-informed networks incorporate the forward model of accelerated MRI reconstruction in the learning process. With increasing network complexity, robustness is not ensured when reconstructing data unseen during training. We aim to embed data consistency (DC) in deep networks while balancing the degree of network complexity. While doing so, we will assess whether either explicit or implicit enforcement of DC in varying network architectures is preferred to optimize performance.Approach.We propose a scheme called Cascades of Independently Recurrent Inference Machines (CIRIM) to assess DC through unrolled optimization. Herein we assess DC both implicitly by gradient descent and explicitly by a designed term. Extensive comparison of the CIRIM to compressed sensing as well as other Machine Learning methods is performed: the End-to-End Variational Network (E2EVN), CascadeNet, KIKINet, LPDNet, RIM, IRIM, and UNet. Models were trained and evaluated on T1-weighted and FLAIR contrast brain data, and T2-weighted knee data. Both 1D and 2D undersampling patterns were evaluated. Robustness was tested by reconstructing 7.5Ã prospectively undersampled 3D FLAIR MRI data of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with white matter lesions.Main results.The CIRIM performed best when implicitly enforcing DC, while the E2EVN required an explicit DC formulation. Through its cascades, the CIRIM was able to score higher on structural similarity and PSNR compared to other methods, in particular under heterogeneous imaging conditions. In reconstructing MS patient data, prospectively acquired with a sampling pattern unseen during model training, the CIRIM maintained lesion contrast while efficiently denoising the images.Significance.The CIRIM showed highly promising generalization capabilities maintaining a very fair trade-off between reconstructed image quality and fast reconstruction times, which is crucial in the clinical workflow.",-1
Relative humidity impacts development and activity against Aedes aegypti adults by granular formulations of Metarhizium humberi microsclerotia,"The impact of ambient relative humidity (RH) on conidial production of Metarhizium humberi IP 46 microsclerotia (MS) formulated in pellets or granules was investigated, and a promising granular formulation was tested against Aedes aegypti adults to confirm its efficacy. Microcrystalline cellulose (MC) and diatomaceous earth (DE) or a combination of vermiculite (VE), DE and silicon dioxide (SD) were tested as carriers in granular formulations containing MS. A range of 93-96.5% RH was critical for fungal development, and at least 96.5-98.5% RH was required for high conidial production on pellets or granules. Conidial production was clearly higher on pellets and granules prepared with VE than MC as the main carrier. VE granules containing MS were highly active against A. aegypti adults. Most mosquitoes were killed within 6 days after treatment regardless of the exposure time of adults to the formulation (1 min-24 h) or ambient humidity (75 or >98%). Production of conidia on dead adults varied between 7.3 Ã 106 and 2.2 Ã 107 conidia/individual, when exposed to MS granules for 12 h and 1 min, respectively. Granular formulations containing VE as the main carrier and MS as the active ingredient of M. humberi have strong potential for use against A. aegypti. KEY POINTS: â?High conidial production on granular microsclerotial formulations at >96.5% RH â?Vermiculite is more appropriate as a carrier than microcrystalline cellulose â?Granules with IP 46 microsclerotia are highly active against Aedes aegypti adults.",-1
Multi-omics investigation of Clostridioides difficile-colonized patients reveals pathogen and commensal correlates of C. difficile pathogenesis,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) imposes a substantial burden on the health care system in the United States. Understanding the biological basis for the spectrum of C. difficile-related disease manifestations is imperative to improving treatment and prevention of CDI. Here, we investigate the correlates of asymptomatic C. difficile colonization using a multi-omics approach. We compared the fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles of patients with CDI versus asymptomatically colonized patients, integrating clinical and pathogen factors into our analysis. We found that CDI patients were more likely to be colonized by strains with the binary toxin (CDT) locus or strains of ribotype 027, which are often hypervirulent. We find that microbiomes of asymptomatically colonized patients are significantly enriched for species in the class Clostridia relative to those of symptomatic patients. Relative to CDI microbiomes, asymptomatically colonized patient microbiomes were enriched with sucrose degradation pathways encoded by commensal Clostridia, in addition to glycoside hydrolases putatively involved in starch and sucrose degradation. Fecal metabolomics corroborates the carbohydrate degradation signature: we identify carbohydrate compounds enriched in asymptomatically colonized patients relative to CDI patients. Further, we reveal that across C. difficile isolates, the carbohydrates sucrose, rhamnose, and lactulose do not serve as robust growth substrates in vitro, consistent with their enriched detection in our metagenomic and metabolite profiling of asymptomatically colonized individuals. We conclude that pathogen genetic variation may be strongly related to disease outcome. More interestingly, we hypothesize that in asymptomatically colonized individuals, carbohydrate metabolism by other commensal Clostridia may prevent CDI by inhibiting C. difficile proliferation. These insights into C. difficile colonization and putative commensal competition suggest novel avenues to develop probiotic or prebiotic therapeutics against CDI.",-1
Structured guideline-based physiotherapy reduces difficulties in activities of daily living in Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    In the long term, Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to the development of difficulties in daily functional tasks. There remains a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of physiotherapy on patient-perceived difficulties regarding basic activities of daily living (ADL).              Objectives:                    To assess an effect of a versatile physiotherapy intervention on patient-perceived difficulties in basic ADL.              Methods:                    The study sample included 24 patients (10 men and 14 women) with PD. Participants were randomly assigned into intervention (IG) and control groups (CG). Two assessments were performed with a gap of 10 weeks. Following first assessment, during an 8-week period, IG participants attended sixteen physiotherapy 60-minutes sessions in groups that were divided into five parts to address the core areas recommended by the European Physiotherapy Guideline for PD (EPGPD): gait, transfers, balance, physical capacity, and manual activities. The main assessment tool was the Modified Patients Specific Functional Scale (ModPSFS), which represents a self-assessment rating on difficulties perceived in 17 different commonly occurring activities.              Results:                    IG members reported a significant reduction in self-perceived difficulties as assessed by ModPSFS (effect size 1.39; 95%CI 5.1, 26.6 points, p = 0.005).              Conclusions:                    2-months conventional physiotherapy with incorporated core areas recommended in EPGPD for PD reduced patient-perceived difficulties in basic ADL.",-1
Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machine learning models predict glucose variability and hypoglycaemia risk in patients with type 2 diabetes on a multiple drug regimen who fast during ramadan (The PROFAST - IT Ramadan study),"Objective:                    To develop a machine-based algorithm from clinical and demographic data, physical activity and glucose variability to predict hyperglycaemic and hypoglycaemic excursions in patients with type 2 diabetes on multiple glucose lowering therapies who fast during Ramadan.              Patients and methods:                    Thirteen patients (10 males and three females) with type 2 diabetes on 3 or more anti-diabetic medications were studied with a Fitbit-2 pedometer device and Freestyle Libre (Abbott Diagnostics) 2 weeks before and 2 weeks during Ramadan. Several machine learning techniques were trained to predict blood glucose levels in a regression framework utilising physical activity and contemporaneous blood glucose levels, comparing Ramadan to non-Ramadan days.              Results:                    The median age of participants was 51 years (IQR 49-52); median BMI was 33.2 kg/m2 (IQR 33.0-35.9) and median HbA1c was 7.3% (IQR 6.7-7.8). The optimal model using physical activity achieved an R2 of 0.548 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 30.30. The addition of electronic health record (ehr) information increased R2 to 0.636 and reduced MAE to 26.89 and the time of the day feature further increased R2 to 0.768 and reduced MAE to 20.55. Combining all the features together resulted in an optimal XGBoost model with an R2 of 0.836 and MAE of 17.47. This model accurately estimated normal glucose levels in 2584/2715 (95.2%) readings and hyperglycaemic events in 852/1031 (82.6%) readings, but fewer hypoglycaemic events (48/172 (27.9%)). The optimal XGBoost model prioritized age, gender, BMI and HbA1c followed by glucose levels and physical activity. Interestingly, the blood glucose level prediction by our model was influenced by use of SGLT2i.              Conclusion:                    XGBoost, a machine learning AI algorithm achieves high predictive performance for normal and hyperglycaemic excursions, but has limited predictive value for hypoglycaemia in patients on multiple therapies who fast during Ramadan.",-1
Supplemental estrogen and caloric restriction reduce obesity-induced periprostatic white adipose inflammation in mice,"Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of high-grade prostate cancer (PC) and worse prognosis for PC patients. Recently, we showed in men that obesity-related periprostatic white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation, characterized by macrophages surrounding dead or dying adipocytes forming crown-like structures, was associated with high-grade PC. Possibly, interventions that suppress periprostatic WAT inflammation will improve outcomes for men with PC. Here, we tested the hypothesis that supplemental 17Î²-estradiol (E2) could decrease periprostatic WAT inflammation in obese male mice. Mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce periprostatic WAT inflammation before being treated with supplemental E2. E2 supplementation suppressed caloric intake, induced weight loss, decreased periprostatic WAT inflammation and downregulated the expression of genes linked to inflammation including Cd68, Mcp1 and Tnf. Similar to the effects of E2 supplementation, treatment with diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen, also suppressed caloric intake and reduced periprostatic WAT inflammation. To determine whether the observed effects of supplemental estrogen could be reproduced by caloric restriction (CR) alone, obese mice were put on a 30% CR diet. Like estrogen treatment, CR was effective in reducing body weight, periprostatic WAT inflammation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Transcriptomic analyses of periprostatic fat showed that obesity was associated with enrichment in inflammatory response pathways, which were normalized by both supplemental E2 and CR. Taken together, these findings strengthen the rationale for future efforts to determine whether either CR or supplemental estrogen will decrease periprostatic WAT inflammation and thereby improve outcomes for men with PC.",-1
Dynamic of the human gut microbiome under infectious diarrhea,"Despite the widespread implementation of sanitation, immunization and appropriate treatment, infectious diarrheal diseases still inflict a great health burden to children living in low resource settings. Conventional microbiology research in diarrhea have focused on the pathogen's biology and pathogenesis, but initial enteric infections could trigger subsequent perturbations in the gut microbiome, leading to short-term or long-term health effects. Conversely, such pre-existing perturbations could render children more vulnerable to enteropathogen colonization and diarrhea. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses have been integrated in well-designed clinical and epidemiological studies, which allow us to track how the gut microbiome changes from disease onset to recovery. Here, we aim to summarize the current understanding on the diarrheal gut microbiome, stratified into different disease stages. Furthermore, we discuss how such perturbations could have impacts beyond an acute diarrhea episode, specifically on the child's nutritional status and the facilitation of antimicrobial resistance.",-1
The Role of Visceral Adiposity Index Levels in Predicting the Presence of Metabolic Syndrome and Insulin Resistance in Overweight and Obese Patients,"Background: To investigate visceral adiposity index (VAI) levels in obese patients with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its relationship with insulin resistance (IR), and define cutoff value of VAI in the determination of patients with MetS and IR. Methods: Aged between 18 and 65, 92 patients with obesity were included. Levels of homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) and VAI were calculated. Results: Of 92 patients, HOMA-IR and VAI levels (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) were found to be higher in 41 (44.6%) with MetS. The cutoff value of VAI in predicting MetS was found to be 2.205. The frequency of MetS was seen as 22.2% when VAI was below this value, but if over, was found to be 66%. There was a positive correlation between VAI and HOMA-IR levels. In 36 cases (39.1%) with HOMA-IR (â?.5), VAI was detected to be higher than those without IR, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were lower. The cutoff value of VAI in predicting IR was found to be 2.31. While the prevalence of IR was 23.4% in those with VAI of 2.31, IR frequency in patients with equal to or greater than 2.31 was determined as 55%. Conclusion: We found that MetS was present in almost half of overweight and obese individuals, and the cutoff values of VAI in predicting the presence of MetS and IR were 2.205 and 2.31, respectively. Our study was carried out in overweight and obese Turkish individuals, and we consider that further studies including normal weight individuals and larger population are required.",-1

Water Dynamics in Cancer Cells: Lessons from Quasielastic Neutron Scattering,"The severity of the cancer statistics around the globe and the complexity involving the behavior of cancer cells inevitably calls for contributions from multidisciplinary areas of research. As such, materials science became a powerful asset to support biological research in comprehending the macro and microscopic behavior of cancer cells and untangling factors that may contribute to their progression or remission. The contributions of cellular water dynamics in this process have always been debated and, in recent years, experimental works performed with Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) brought new perspectives to these discussions. In this review, we address these works and highlight the value of QENS in comprehending the role played by water molecules in tumor cells and their response to external agents, particularly chemotherapy drugs. In addition, this paper provides an overview of QENS intended for scientists with different backgrounds and comments on the possibilities to be explored with the next-generation spectrometers under construction.",-1
4-Pyridone-3-carboxamide-1-Î²-D-ribonucleoside (4PYR)-A Novel Oncometabolite Modulating Cancer-Endothelial Interactions in Breast Cancer Metastasis,"The accumulation of specific metabolic intermediates is known to promote cancer progression. We analyzed the role of 4-pyridone-3-carboxamide-1-Î²-D-ribonucleoside (4PYR), a nucleotide metabolite that accumulates in the blood of cancer patients, using the 4T1 murine in vivo breast cancer model, and cultured cancer (4T1) and endothelial cells (ECs) for in vitro studies. In vivo studies demonstrated that 4PYR facilitated lung metastasis without affecting primary tumor growth. In vitro studies demonstrated that 4PYR affected extracellular adenine nucleotide metabolism and the intracellular energy status in ECs, shifting catabolite patterns toward the accumulation of extracellular inosine, and leading to the increased permeability of lung ECs. These changes prevailed over the direct effect of 4PYR on 4T1 cells that reduced their invasive potential through 4PYR-induced modulation of the CD73-adenosine axis. We conclude that 4PYR is an oncometabolite that affects later stages of the metastatic cascade by acting specifically through the regulation of EC permeability and metabolic controls of inflammation.",-1
AhR/IL-22 pathway as new target for the treatment of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome symptoms,"Alterations in brain/gut/microbiota axis are linked to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) physiopathology. Upon gastrointestinal infection, chronic abdominal pain and anxio-depressive comorbidities may persist despite pathogen clearance leading to Post-Infectious IBS (PI-IBS). This study assesses the influence of tryptophan metabolism, and particularly the microbiota-induced AhR expression, on intestinal homeostasis disturbance following gastroenteritis resolution, and evaluates the efficacy of IL-22 cytokine vectorization on PI-IBS symptoms. The Citrobacter rodentium infection model in C57BL6/J mice was used to mimic Enterobacteria gastroenteritis. Intestinal homeostasis was evaluated as low-grade inflammation, permeability, mucosa-associated microbiota composition, and colonic sensitivity. Cognitive performances and emotional state of animals were assessed using several tests. Tryptophan metabolism was analyzed by targeted metabolomics. AhR activity was evaluated using a luciferase reporter assay method. One Lactococcus lactis strain carrying an eukaryotic expression plasmid for murine IL-22 (L. lactisIL-22) was used to induce IL-22 production in mouse colonic mucosa. C. rodentium-infected mice exhibited persistent colonic hypersensitivity and cognitive impairments and anxiety-like behaviors after pathogen clearance. These post-infectious disorders were associated with low-grade inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, decrease of Lactobacillaceae abundance associated with the colonic layer, and increase of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). During post-infection period, the indole pathway and AhR activity were decreased due to a reduction of tryptophol production. Treatment with L. lactisIL-22 restored gut permeability and normalized colonic sensitivity, restored cognitive performances and decreased anxiety-like behaviors. Data from the video-tracking system suggested an upgrade of welfare for mice receiving the L.lactisIL-22 strain. Our findings revealed that AhR/IL-22 signaling pathway is altered in a preclinical PI-IBS model. IL-22 delivering alleviate PI-IBS symptoms as colonic hypersensitivity, cognitive impairments, and anxiety-like behaviors by acting on intestinal mucosa integrity. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway could be developed to treat IBS patients suffering from chronic abdominal pain and associated well-being disorders.",-1
"High insecticide resistance mediated by different mechanisms in Culex quinquefasciatus populations from the city of YaoundÃ©, Cameroon","Culex mosquitoes particularly Culex quinquefasciatus are important arboviral and filariasis vectors, however despite this important epidemiological role, there is still a paucity of data on their bionomics. The present study was undertaken to assess the insecticide resistance status of Cx. quinquefasciatus populations from four districts of YaoundÃ© (Cameroon). All Culex quinquefasciatus populations except one displayed high resistance to bendiocarb and malathion with mortalities ranging from 0 to 89% while high resistance intensity against both permethrin and deltamethrin was recorded. Molecular analyses revealed high frequencies of the ACE-1 G119S mutation (ranging from 0 to 33%) and kdr L1014F allele (ranging from 55 to 74%) in all Cx. quinquefasciatus populations. Significant overexpression was detected for cytochrome P450s genes CYP6AA7 and CYP6Z10, as well as for Esterase A and Esterase B genes. The total cuticular hydrocarbon content, a proxy of cuticular resistance, was significantly increased (compared to the S-lab strain) in one population. The study confirms strong insecticide resistance mediated by different mechanisms in Cx. quinquefasciatus populations from the city of YaoundÃ©. The expansion of insecticide resistance in Culex populations could affect the effectiveness of current vector control measures and stress the need for the implementation of integrated vector control strategies in urban settings.",-1
Healthcare Utilization and Adherence to Treatment Recommendations among Children with Type 1 Diabetes in Poland during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is, next to obesity and asthma, the most common chronic disease in children in Poland. The results of T1D treatment strongly depend on the patient's compliance with therapeutic recommendations, which entails the use of necessary health services. Based on a retrospective analysis of the data on health services provided in 2016-2020 to over 15.5 thousand patients with T1D in Poland, we assessed the compliance of the actual model of treatment of T1D in children with the current guidelines. It was found that only about 50% of patients received the number of diabetes consultations corresponding to the recognized standards, with about 15% of children with T1D remaining outside the public healthcare system. In the case of many outpatient services (ophthalmological, neurological, mental health), the number of consultations was extremely low-one order of magnitude lower than in general population and dropped even lower in 2020. This shows that the health needs of children with T1D are not being met within the public healthcare system. The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant limitations in access to healthcare in Poland. Compared to the pre-pandemic period there was a significant decrease (-27% compared to 2019) in the number of hospitalizations, and a substantial increase (+22% compared to 2019) in the number of diabetic ketoacidoses (DKA) cases. The proportion of hospitalizations caused by DKA rose to 8.9% compared to 7.3% in 2019.",-1
An Integrative Bioinformatic Analysis of Microbiome and Transcriptome for Predicting the Risk of Colon Adenocarcinoma,"The abundance of gut microbiota is significantly decreased in patients with colorectal tumors compared to healthy groups. However, few studies have been conducted to correlate the differences in gut microbiota in colon cancer patients with different prognosis. In this study, we analysed the gut microbiota among patients with colon cancer and determined the microbial characteristics of COAD and divided the overall survival of COAD data into the high- and low-risk groups. In addition, we established a microbiome-related gene map and determined the association between microbial features and immune cell infiltration in COAD. In comparison with the low-risk group, the high risk group of COAD samples exhibited a decreased proportion of activated CD4 T cells as well as an increased proportion of M2 macrophages. The current data suggested that different gut flora backgrounds lead to different gene expression profiles, which in turn affect immune cell typing and colorectal tumor prognosis.",-1
Visceral adiposity index outperforms common anthropometric indices in predicting 10-year diabetes risk: Results from the ATTICA study,"Background:                    Visceral adiposity index (VAI) is a novel marker of visceral adipose tissue accumulation and dysfunction. The study aim was to explore the association of VAI with the 10-year type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence in apparently healthy individuals and compare its T2DM predictive ability against common anthropometric indices.              Methods:                    In 2001 to 2002, the ATTICA study (Greece) recruited a random sample of 1514 and 1528 CVD-free men (18-87 years old) and women (18-89 years old), respectively. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, clinical, and biochemical characteristics of participants were measured at baseline, and the 10-year follow-up was performed during 2011 to 2012. After excluding participants with diabetes at baseline and participants without complete follow-up information regarding diabetes status and/or baseline VAI values, the working sample consisted of 1049 participants. In this sample, the predictive value of baseline VAI value was studied in relation to 10-year diabetes incidence.              Results:                    One hundred thirty-three incident cases of diabetes were documented (10-year incidence: 12.7%). In the fully adjusted model, VAI significantly increased diabetes risk by 22% (OR per 1-unit increase =1.22; 95%CI, 1.09-1.37). Markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were found to, at least partly, mediate this relationship. Also, a moderating effect of menstruation status was revealed among women. VAI showed the highest predictive ability and contributed the most, along with waist-to-height ratio, to the correct classification of participants who developed diabetes.              Conclusions:                    The present findings suggest that VAI may be a useful index for predicting long-term diabetes development and may exhibit better predictive ability to commonly used anthropometric indices.",-1
Parkinson's disease related alterations in cannabinoid transmission,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) by neurodegeneration. Recent findings in animal models of PD propose tonic inhibition of the remaining DA neurons through GABA release from reactive glial cells. Movement dysfunctions could be ameliorated by promotion of activity in dormant DA cells. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is extensively present in basal ganglia (BG) and is known as an indirect modulator of DAergic neurotransmission, thus drugs designed to target this system have shown promising therapeutic potential in PD patients. Interestingly, down/up-regulation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) varies across the different stages of PD, suggesting that some of the motor/ non-motor deficits may be related to changes in CBRs. Determination of the profile of changes of these receptors across the different stages of PD as well as their neural distribution within the BG could improve understanding of PD and identify pathways important in disease pathobiology. In this review, we focus on temporal and spatial alterations of CBRs during PD in the BG. At present, as inconclusive, but suggestive results have been obtained, future investigations should be conducted to extend preclinical studies examining CBRs changes within each stage in controlled clinical trials in order to determine the potential of targeting CBRs in management of PD.",-1
Online Anomaly Detection of Industrial IoT Based on Hybrid Machine Learning Architecture,"Industrial IoT (IIoT) in Industry 4.0 integrates everything at the level of information technology with the level of technology of operation and aims to improve Business to Business (B2B) services (from production to public services). It includes Machine to Machine (M2M) interaction either for process control (e.g., factory processes, fleet tracking) or as part of self-organizing cyber-physical distributed control systems without human intervention. A critical factor in completing the abovementioned actions is the development of intelligent software systems in the context of automatic control of the business environment, with the ability to analyze in real-time the existing equipment through the available interfaces (hardware-in-the-loop). In this spirit, this paper presents an advanced intelligent approach to real-time monitoring of the operation of industrial equipment. A hybrid novel methodology that combines memory neural networks is used, and Bayesian methods that examine a variety of characteristic quantities of vibration signals that are exported in the field of time, with the aim of real-time detection of abnormalities in active IIoT equipment are also used.",-1
"Epidemiology of dengue virus infections in Nepal, 2006-2019","Background:                    Dengue is one of the newest emerging diseases in Nepal with increasing burden and geographic spread over the years. The main objective of this study was to explore the epidemiological patterns of dengue since its first outbreak (2006) to 2019 in Nepal.              Methods:                    This study is a retrospective analysis that covers the last 14 years (2006-2019) of reported dengue cases from Epidemiology Diseases Control Division (EDCD), Ministry of Health and Population, Government of Nepal. Reported cases were plotted over time and maps of reported case incidence were generated (from 2016 through 2019). An ecological analysis of environmental predictors of case incidence was conducted using negative binomial regression.              Results:                    While endemic dengue has been reported in Nepal since 2006, the case load has increased over time and in 2019 a total of 17 992 dengue cases were reported from 68 districts (from all seven provinces). Compared to the case incidence in 2016, incidence was approximately five times higher in 2018 [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 4.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-15.3] and over 140 times higher in 2019 (IRR: 141.6; 95% CI 45.8-438.4). A one standard deviation increase in elevation was associated with a 90% decrease in reported case incidence (IRR: 0.10; 95% CI 0.01-0.20). However, the association between elevation and reported cases varied across the years. In 2018 there was a cluster of cases reported from high elevation Kaski District of Gandaki Province. Our results suggest that dengue infections are increasing in magnitude and expanding out of the lowland areas to higher elevations over time.              Conclusions:                    There is a high risk of dengue outbreak in the lowland Terai region, with increasing spread towards the mid-mountains and beyond as seen over the last 14 years. Urgent measures are required to increase the availability of diagnostics and resources to mitigate future dengue epidemics.",-1
Comparisons of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 signals in Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism secondary to carbon monoxide poisoning,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning demonstrate parkinsonian features related to presynaptic dopaminergic deficits. However, their clinical features and treatment responses are different, indicating other roles of neurotransmitters in symptomatic modulation. In this study, we used 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ PET to explore vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) distributions in 31 patients with PD, 39 patients with CO poisoning and parkinsonian features (n = 39), and 24 age-matched controls. In addition to the disease-specific VMAT2 topographies in PD and CO poisoning, we also constructed feature-specific functional networks. The cardinal features included tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and rapid alternating movements (RAM), and the overall motor severity was scored using Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and modified Hoehn-Yahr (mH-Y) Scale scores. Our results suggested that a reduction in VMAT2 signals in the caudate, amygdala, and hippocampus were more specific to CO poisoning, while low uptake in the putamen and substantia nigra was more specific to PD. UPDRS and mH-Y scores were related to striatum signals in both groups and hippocampus and raphe in the CO poisoning group. With regards to the cardinal features, the putamen was related to akinesia in both groups. The substantia nigra was related to rigidity in PD, and the caudate and nucleus accumbens were related to akinesia, RAM and rigidity in CO poisoning. Our study enhances the current understanding of different patterns of monoaminergic terminal deficits in patients with CO poisoning and PD.",-1
Machine Learning to Predict Risk of Relapse Using Cytologic Image Markers in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Posthematopoietic Cell Transplantation,"Purpose:                    Allogenic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HCT) is a curative therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Relapse post-HCT is the most common cause of treatment failure and is associated with a poor prognosis. Pathologist-based visual assessment of aspirate images and the manual myeloblast counting have shown to be predictive of relapse post-HCT. However, this approach is time-intensive and subjective. The premise of this study was to explore whether computer-extracted morphology and texture features from myeloblasts' chromatin patterns could help predict relapse and prognosticate relapse-free survival (RFS) after HCT.              Materials and methods:                    In this study, Wright-Giemsa-stained post-HCT aspirate images were collected from 92 patients with AML/MDS who were randomly assigned into a training set (St = 52) and a validation set (Sv = 40). First, a deep learning-based model was developed to segment myeloblasts. A total of 214 texture and shape descriptors were then extracted from the segmented myeloblasts on aspirate slide images. A risk score on the basis of texture features of myeloblast chromatin patterns was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with a Cox regression model.              Results:                    The risk score was associated with RFS in St (hazard ratio = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.95; P = .0008) and Sv (hazard ratio = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.45; P = .044). We also demonstrate that this resulting signature was predictive of AML relapse with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 within Sv. All the relevant code is available at GitHub.              Conclusion:                    The texture features extracted from chromatin patterns of myeloblasts can predict post-HCT relapse and prognosticate RFS of patients with AML/MDS.",-1
Dengue and metabolomics in humans,"Background:                    Dengue virus causes dengue fever (DF)disease, transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The symptoms could be severe and disable the affected individuals for weeks. The severe form, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), can lead to death if not adequately attended to. Due to global warming, the vector mosquito will advance over new areas and expose more people to this disease over the next decades. Despite the severity, there are no treatments nor efficient vaccines available. Metabolomic studies have shown a new perspective to understand this disease better at a new molecular level.              Aim of review:                    Many published works rely on samples obtained from animal studies. This review will mainly focus on human samples and cell culture experiments to view how the dengue virus affects the metabolomic profile.              Key scientific concepts of review:                    The review compiles the sample sources, metabolomic techniques used, the detected compounds, and how they behave in different DF stages. This disease causes a significant change in many metabolites, but some results are still conflicting between studies. The results gathered here show that metabolomic approaches prove to be an excellent and viable way to expand knowledge about DF.",-1
"Frequency tuning of swarming male mosquitoes (Aedes communis, Culicidae) and its neural mechanisms","The primary function of hearing in mosquitoes is believed to be intraspecific communication. This view dictated the principle of many behavioral studies, namely, the attraction of male mosquitoes to the sounds that mimicked a female tone. However, after the avoidance response to certain frequencies of sound was demonstrated, it became clear that attraction tests cannot fully account for all the capabilities of the mosquito auditory system. In addition, the tuning curves obtained by electrophysiological measurements differ from the behavioral ones. We designed a simple but robust field test based on responses of swarming mosquitoes to sound stimulation, but not limited to the attraction response. Here we report the auditory thresholds over a wide range of sound frequencies measured in the field from swarms of Aedes communis mosquitoes. In parallel, the auditory sensitivity of male mosquitoes taken from the same swarms was measured electrophysiologically. Surprisingly, we found high acoustic sensitivity; 26 dBSPL on average, in the frequency range 180-220 Hz (ambient temperature 12 Â°C). In addition, responses were found in the high-frequency range, 500-700 Hz (the so-called 'mirror channel'). Two types of auditory units were recorded: more sensitive broadband neurons and less sensitive units with distinct narrow (quality factor Q6 = 7.4) frequency tunings in the range 180-350 Hz. We propose that the former provides the detection of signal while the latter are used for frequency identification in order to make a behavioral choice.",-1
Study on the digestive characteristics of short-and medium-chain fatty acid structural lipid and its rapid intervention on gut microbes: In vivo and in vitro studies,"Structuring is a feasible scheme to improve lipids' value. Here, SBL and SLBL (C4-C12 structural lipids) were obtained through enzymatic ester-ester transesterification or acidolysis interesterification using glyceryl tributyrate/glyceryl tridodecanoate and lauric acid/glyceryl tributyrate as raw materials, respectively. The digestive characteristics of SBL and SLBL were investigated in vitro and in vivo, meanwhile, their effects on gut microbes were studied. Compared with their corresponding triglyceride physical mixture, SBL possessed an ideal butyric acid sustained-release effect in simulated stomach digestion. Moreover, the sustained-release effect of SLBL on glycerol monolaurate (GML) was revealed both in vivo and in vitro, while this effect of the SBL was obviously occurred in small intestine. SBL significantly increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium and SLBL promoted the growth of Clostridiales within 24 h. Overall, both SBL and SLBL showed ideal sustained-release effects on GML rather than butyric acid, which may lead to positive changes in gut microbes.",-1
Diagnostic and Therapeutic Perspectives Associated to Cobalamin-Dependent Metabolism and Transcobalamins' Synthesis in Solid Cancers,"Cobalamin or vitamin B12 (B12) is a cofactor for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, two enzymes implicated in key pathways for cell proliferation: methylation, purine synthesis, succinylation and ATP production. Ensuring these functions in cancer cells therefore requires important cobalamin needs and its uptake through the transcobalamin II receptor (TCII-R). Thus, both the TCII-R and the cobalamin-dependent metabolic pathways constitute promising therapeutic targets to inhibit cancer development. However, the link between cobalamin and solid cancers is not limited to cellular metabolism, as it also involves the circulating transcobalamins I and II (TCI or haptocorrin and TCII) carrier proteins, encoded by TCN1 and TCN2, respectively. In this respect, elevations of B12, TCI and TCII concentrations in plasma are associated with cancer onset and relapse, and with the presence of metastases and worse prognosis. In addition, TCN1 and TCN2 overexpressions are associated with chemoresistance and a proliferative phenotype, respectively. Here we review the involvement of cobalamin and transcobalamins in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and as potential therapeutic targets. We further detail the relationship between cobalamin-dependent metabolic pathways in cancer cells and the transcobalamins' abundancies in plasma and tumors, to ultimately hypothesize screening and therapeutic strategies linking these aspects.",-1
Factors Influencing the Risk of Major Amputation in Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers Treated by Autologous Cell Therapy,"Introduction:                    Autologous cell therapy (ACT) is one of the last options for limb salvage in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). However, some patients may still undergo a major amputation even after ACT, but the risk factors for this are not known. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the risk factors for major amputation in patients with CLTI and DFU during a 2-year follow-up after ACT.              Methods:                    One hundred and thirteen patients after ACT were included in our study and divided into two groups: Group 1 with major amputation (AMP; n = 37) and Group 2 without amputation (nAMP, n = 76). The risk factors for major amputation were evaluated before ACT and included factors relating to the patient, the DFU, and the cell product.              Results:                    The AMP group had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared to the nAMP group (22.7 vs. 10.7 mg/L, p = 0.024). In stepwise logistic regression, independent predictors for major amputation were mutation of the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with heterozygote and homozygote polymorphism 1298 (OR 4.33 [95% CI 1.05-17.6]), smoking (OR 3.83 [95% CI 1.18-12.5]), and CRP > 10 mg/L (OR 2.76 [95% CI 0.93-8.21]). Lower transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) values were observed in AMP patients compared to the nAMP group at one month (24.5 vs. 33.2, p = 0.012) and at 3 months (31.1 vs. 40.9, p = 0.009) after ACT.              Conclusion:                    Our study showed that the risk for major amputation after ACT in patients with CLTI and DFU is increased by the presence of MTHFR heterozygote and homozygote gene mutations, smoking, and higher CRP at baseline. Lower TcPO2 at one and 3 months after ACT may also have a predictive value. Therefore, it is necessary to stop smoking before ACT, treat any infection, and, above all, consider antiaggregation or anticoagulant treatment after the procedure.",-1
An Attribute Extraction for Automated Malware Attack Classification and Detection Using Soft Computing Techniques,"Malware has grown in popularity as a method of conducting cyber assaults in former decades as a result of numerous new deception methods employed by malware. To preserve networks, information, and intelligence, malware must be detected as soon as feasible. This article compares various attribute extraction techniques with distinct machine learning algorithms for static malware classification and detection. The findings indicated that merging PCA attribute extraction and SVM classifier results in the highest correct rate with the fewest possible attributes, and this paper discusses sophisticated malware, their detection techniques, and how and where to defend systems and data from malware attacks. Overall, 96% the proposed method determines the malware more accurately than the existing methods.",-1
Efficacy and safety of Mudan granules for painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy: A protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"Background:                    As one of the most challenging complications in the management of diabetes mellitus, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is accompanied by various clinical manifestations, including numbness, burning, coldness, and other sensory abnormalities in the extremities. Meanwhile, PDPN seriously affects the life quality of patients and causes great pain. Western medicine mostly provides symptomatic treatments, such as antioxidants, aldose reductase inhibitors, nerve nutrition, microcirculation improvement, and analgesic drugs on the basis of blood sugar control. Although certain efficacy has been achieved, the problem has not been solved at root. Mudan granules have some advantages in the treatment of PDPN, but there is insufficient high-quality clinical studies to verify this. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mudan granules in treating PDPN.              Methods:                    A randomized, double-blind, placebo, and parallel-controlled trial design was used to study the efficacy and safety of Mudan granules in the treatment of PDPN. In this study, 93 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy were recruited and randomly divided into a treatment group and a placebo group based on 1:1. The treatment group was given Mudan granules and the control group accepted placebo treatment, and the basic treatment was performed according to the recommended guidelines. During the treatment period, the patients' visual analog scores, clinical efficacy, Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, nerve conduction velocity, and drug-induced adverse reactions were observed at baseline after 8 and 10 weeks.              Discussion:                    This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mudan granules in treating PDPN. The experimental results will provide evidence support to treat PDPN with Mudan granules.              Trial registration:                    DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/5CE32.",-1
"Overexpression of long non-coding RNA ACTA2-AS1 inhibits the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells","The role of long non-coding RNA ACTA2 antisense RNA 1 (LncRNA ACTA2-AS1) in colorectal cancer (CRC) was awaited to be elucidated. Clinical specimen and data on ACTA2-AS1 expression in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) were collected, followed by in situ hybridization. Transfected CRC cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion were determined with Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Scratch, and Transwell assays, respectively. Relative expressions of ACTA2-AS1, PCNA, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. ACTA2-AS1 expression was downregulated in CRC. Overexpressed ACTA2-AS1 repressed the cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion, increased cleaved caspase-3 level yet decreased PCNA, Bcl-2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. ACTA2-AS1 silencing, however, did oppositely. Collectively, ACTA2-AS1 inhibits the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells to effectively suppress the progression of CRC.",-1
Hepatitis B Virus-Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is DNA-based virus, member of the Hepadnaviridae family, which can cause liver disease and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in infected individuals, replicating within the hepatocytes and interacting with several cellular proteins. Chronic hepatitis B can progressively lead to liver cirrhosis, which is an independent risk factor for HCC. Complications as liver decompensation or HCC impact the survival of HBV patients and concurrent HDV infection worsens the disease. The available data provide evidence that HBV infection is associated with the risk of developing HCC with or without an underlying liver cirrhosis, due to various direct and indirect mechanisms promoting hepatocarcinogenesis. The molecular profile of HBV-HCC is extensively and continuously under study, and it is the result of altered molecular pathways, which modify the microenvironment and lead to DNA damage. HBV produces the protein HBx, which has a central role in the oncogenetic process. Furthermore, the molecular profile of HBV-HCC was recently discerned from that of HDV-HCC, despite the obligatory dependence of HDV on HBV. Proper management of the underlying HBV-related liver disease is fundamental, including HCC surveillance, viral suppression, and application of adequate predictive models. When HBV-HCC occurs, liver function and HCC characteristics guide the physician among treatment strategies but always considering the viral etiology in the treatment choice.",-1
Editors' Review and Introduction: Levels of Explanation in Cognitive Science: From Molecules to Culture,"Cognitive science began as a multidisciplinary endeavor to understand how the mind works. Since the beginning, cognitive scientists have been asking questions about the right methodologies and levels of explanation to pursue this goal, and make cognitive science a coherent science of the mind. Key questions include: Is there a privileged level of explanation in cognitive science? How do different levels of explanation fit together, or relate to one another? How should explanations at one level inform or constrain explanations at some other level? Can the different approaches to the mind, brain, and culture be unified? The aim of this issue of topiCS is to provide a platform for discussing different answers to such questions and to facilitate a better understanding between the different strands of thinking about the right levels of explanation in cognitive science.",-1
Dlk1 expression relates to visceral fat expansion and insulin resistance in male and female rats with postnatal catch-up growth,"Background:                    Although prenatal and postnatal programming of metabolic diseases in adulthood is well established, the mechanisms underpinning metabolic programming are not. Dlk1, a key regulator of fetal development, inhibits adipocyte differentiation and restricts fetal growth.              Methods:                    Assess DLk1 expression in a Wistar rat model of catch-up growth following intrauterine restriction. Dams fed ad libitum delivered control pups (C) and dams on a 50% calorie-restricted diet delivered pups with low birth weight (R). Restricted offspring fed a standard rat chow showed catch-up growth (R/C) but those kept on a calorie-restricted diet did not (R/R).              Results:                    Decreased Dlk1 expression was observed in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of R/C pups along with excessive visceral fat accumulation, decreased circulating adiponectin, increased triglycerides and HOMA-IR (from p < 0.05 to p < 0.0001). Moreover, in R/C pups the reduced Dlk1 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle correlated with visceral fat (r = -0.820, p < 00001) and HOMA-IR (r = -0.745, p = 0.002).              Conclusions:                    Decreased Dlk1 expression relates to visceral fat expansion and insulin resistance in a rat model of catch-up growth following prenatal growth restriction. Modulation of Dlk1 expression could be among the targets for the early prevention of fetal programming of adult metabolic disorders.",-1
Exploring Complex Reaction Networks Using Neural Network-Based Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is an established method for revealing the reactive dynamics of complex systems. However, the high computational cost of AIMD restricts the explorable length and time scales. Here, we develop a fundamentally different approach using molecular dynamics simulations powered by a neural network potential to investigate complex reaction networks. This potential is trained via a workflow combining AIMD and interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality to accelerate the sampling of rare reactive processes. A panoramic visualization of the complex reaction networks for decomposition of a novel high explosive (ICM-102) is achieved without any predefined reaction coordinates. The study leads to the discovery of new pathways that would be difficult to uncover if established methods were employed. These results highlight the power of neural network-based molecular dynamics simulations in exploring complex reaction mechanisms under extreme conditions at the ab initio level, pushing the limit of theoretical and computational chemistry toward the realism and fidelity of experiments.",-1
The pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of ivermectin in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,"Mosquitoes are vectors of major diseases such as dengue fever and malaria. Mass drug administration of endectocides to humans and livestock is a promising complementary approach to current insecticide-based vector control measures. The aim of this study was to establish an insect model for pharmacokinetic and drug-drug interaction studies to develop sustainable endectocides for vector control. Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were fed with human blood containing either ivermectin alone or ivermectin in combination with ketoconazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, or piperonyl butoxide. Drug concentrations were quantified by LC-MS/MS at selected time points post-feeding. Primary pharmacokinetic parameters and extent of drug-drug interactions were calculated by pharmacometric modelling. Lastly, the drug effect of the treatments was examined. The mosquitoes could be dosed with a high precision (%CV: â?3.4%) over a range of 0.01-1 Î¼g/ml ivermectin without showing saturation (R2: 0.99). The kinetics of ivermectin were characterised by an initial lag phase of 18.5 h (CI90%: 17.0-19.8 h) followed by a slow zero-order elimination rate of 5.5 pg/h (CI90%: 5.1-5.9 pg/h). By contrast, ketoconazole, ritonavir, and piperonyl butoxide were immediately excreted following first order elimination, whereas rifampicin accumulated over days in the mosquitoes. Ritonavir increased the lag phase of ivermectin by 11.4 h (CI90%: 8.7-14.2 h) resulting in an increased exposure (+29%) and an enhanced mosquitocidal effect. In summary, this study shows that the pharmacokinetics of drugs can be investigated and modulated in an Ae. aegypti animal model. This may help in the development of novel vector-control interventions and further our understanding of toxicology in arthropods.",-1
ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy Supported by Multivariate Analysis for the Characterization of Adipose Tissue Aspirates from Patients Affected by Systemic Amyloidosis,"Deposition of misfolded proteins as extracellular amyloid aggregates is the pathological hallmark of systemic amyloidoses. Subcutaneous fat acquired by fine needle aspiration is the preferred screening tissue in suspected patients. In this study we employed Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection (ATR) to investigate human abdominal fat aspirates with the aim of detecting disease-related changes in the molecular structure and composition of the tissue and exploiting the potentiality of the method to discriminate between amyloid-positive and -negative samples. The absorption and second-derivative spectra of Congo Red (CR) positive and CR-negative specimens were analyzed by three multivariate methods in four spectral regions. The proposed ATR-FTIR method is label-free, rapid, and relatively inexpensive and requires minimal sample preparation. We found that the ATR-FTIR approach can differentiate fat aspirates containing amyloid deposits from control specimens with high sensitivity and specificity, both at 100 [89-100]%. It is worth noting that the wavenumbers most important for discrimination indicate that changes both in the protein conformation and in resident lipids are intrinsic features of affected subcutaneous fat in comparison with the CR-negative controls. In this proof of concept study, we show that this approach could be useful for assessing tissue amyloid aggregates and for acquiring novel knowledge of the molecular bases of the disease.",-1
Molecular Beacon for Detection miRNA-21 as a Biomarker of Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Although the diagnosis and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80% of LC cases, have greatly improved in the past decade, there is still an urgent need to find more sensitive and specific screening methods. Recently, new molecular biomarkers are emerging as potential non-invasive diagnostic agents to screen NSCLC, including multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) that show an unusual expression profile. Moreover, peripheral blood mononuclear cells' (PBMCs) miRNA profile could be linked with NSCLC and used for diagnosis. We developed a molecular beacon (MB)-based miRNA detection strategy for NSCLC. Following PBMCs isolation and screening of the expression profile of a panel of miRNA by RT-qPCR, we designed a MB targeting of up-regulated miR-21-5p. This MB 21-5p was characterized by FRET-melting, CD, NMR and native PAGE, allowing the optimization of an in-situ approach involving miR-21-5p detection in PBMCs via MB. Data show the developed MB approach potential for miR-21-5p detection in PBMCs from clinical samples towards NSCLC.",-1
Validation of a Sensor-Based Gait Analysis System with a Gold-Standard Motion Capture System in Patients with Parkinson's Disease,"Digital technologies provide the opportunity to analyze gait patterns in patients with Parkinson's Disease using wearable sensors in clinical settings and a home environment. Confirming the technical validity of inertial sensors with a 3D motion capture system is a necessary step for the clinical application of sensor-based gait analysis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare gait parameters measured by a mobile sensor-based gait analysis system and a motion capture system as the gold standard. Gait parameters of 37 patients were compared between both systems after performing a standardized 5 Ã 10 m walking test by reliability analysis using intra-class correlation and Bland-Altman plots. Additionally, gait parameters of an age-matched healthy control group (n = 14) were compared to the Parkinson cohort. Gait parameters representing bradykinesia and short steps showed excellent reliability (ICC > 0.96). Shuffling gait parameters reached ICC > 0.82. In a stridewise synchronization, no differences were observed for gait speed, stride length, stride time, relative stance and swing time (p > 0.05). In contrast, heel strike, toe off and toe clearance significantly differed between both systems (p < 0.01). Both gait analysis systems distinguish Parkinson patients from controls. Our results indicate that wearable sensors generate valid gait parameters compared to the motion capture system and can consequently be used for clinically relevant gait recordings in flexible environments.",-1
Predictors of Spiritual Well-Being in Family Caregivers for Individuals with Parkinson's Disease,"Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative illness that causes disability through both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Family caregivers provide substantial care to persons living with PD, often at great personal cost. While spiritual well-being and spirituality have been suggested to promote resiliency in caregivers of persons living with cancer and dementia, this issue has not been explored in PD. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify predictors of spiritual well-being in PD patients' caregivers. Design: A cross-sectional analysis was performed. Our primary outcome measure, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp), was measured in caregivers alongside measures of patient quality of life, symptom burden, global function, grief, and spiritual well-being and caregiver mood, burden, and perceptions of patient quality of life. Univariate correlation and multiple regression were used to determine associations between predictor variables and caregiver FACIT-Sp. Setting/Subjects: PD patient/caregiver dyads were recruited through three academic medical centers in the United States and Canada and regional community support groups. Results: We recruited 183 dyads. Patient faith, symptom burden, health-related quality of life, depression, motor function, and grief were significant predictors of caregiver spiritual well-being. Predictive caregiver factors included caregiver depression and anxiety. These factors remained significant in combined models, suggesting that both patient and caregiver factors make independent contributions to caregiver spiritual well-being. Conclusions: The present study suggests that both patient and caregiver factors are associated with spiritual well-being in PD. Further study is needed to understand the causal relationship of these factors and whether interventions to support caregiver spiritual well-being improve outcomes for caregivers or patients.

Consumption of different types of bakery products and its effect on visceral fat area in healthy population,"Background:                    Bread is one of the worldâs most consumed food commodity. However, in the last years consumption of bread and bakery products has declined, especially in the Western population. The reason for concern is the weight gain and presence of gluten in these products. Gluten is unacceptable in the diet only in patients with celiac disease who are forced adhere the gluten-free diet all the time. The consequences of gluten-free diet in healthy people are the subject of many recent studies.              Objective:                    The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes of visceral fat area in the general population after 6 weeks of consumption of gluten-free, gluten-containing and whole-grain bread and other bakery products.              Material and methods:                    The study group consisted of 120 volunteers divided into four subgroups each with 30 subjects. Anthropometric measurements were made using the InBody 720 (Biospace Co. Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea). We used the LookinâBody 3.0 software to process the results. The collected data from anthropometric measurements were evaluated statistically and graphically in Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Los Angeles, CA, USA).              Results:                    After the intervention we found out that visceral fat area values increased in probands consuming gluten-free and gluten-containing bakery products, but these changes were not significant (P>0.05; 72.7Â±29.18 cm2 vs 73.26Â±30.32 cm2 and 69.6Â±34.06 cm2 vs 70.34Â±32.33 cm2, respectively). In whole-grain and control group we observed a reduction in visceral fat area, in the control group there was a significant change (P>0.05 â?91.58Â±33 cm2 vs 90.47Â±34.37 cm2 and P<0.05 â?77.3Â±21.65 cm2 vs 75.56Â±21.87 cm2, respectively). After the intervention the visceral fat area values increased in gluten-free group in 57% of subjects, in gluten group in 73% of subjects and in the whole-grain group in 43% of volunteers. Although visceral fat area values had inceased in gluten-free and gluten-containing groups, the number of probands with reference values increased from 80% to 86% in the gluten-free group and from 43% to 66% in the gluten-containing group. In the whole-grain group we found decrease in number of subjects with reference values of visceral fat area (from 70% to 63%). There were no changes in the control group (86% vs. 86%).              Conclusions:                    Consumption of different types of bakery products has mostly changed the visceral fat area values in a positive direction.",-1
Minimally invasive combined approach robotic thymectomy and transcervical total thyroidectomy,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction in the USA. It is not uncommon for these patients to have concomitant autoimmune diseases including autoimmune thyroid disease. We describe here our method of performing a reproducible robotically assisted one-stage thymectomy and thyroidectomy. An African-American woman presented to our institution with a medical history of hypertension, morbid obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, symptomatic MG and symptomatic non-toxic substernal multinodular goitre. A one-stage minimally invasive right-sided robotic radical thymectomy and a transcervical total thyroidectomy with excision of the substernal goitre was successfully performed. The treatment of thyroid and thymus pathologies varies drastically from medical observation to surgery. This combined approach surgery clearly benefits the patient by offering similar operative time, fewer operative and postoperative recovery experiences, decreased anaesthesia risks associated with MG patients through fewer intubations, and a faster return to baseline function.",-1
Interactions between opioids and cannabinoids: Economic demand for opioid/cannabinoid mixtures,"Background:                    Opioid abuse remains a significant public health challenge. With continuing emergence of novel psychoactive substances (e.g., synthetic cannabinoids found in ""K2"" or ""spice"" preparations), the co-administration of opioids and other novel drugs is likely to become more prevalent, which might increase the risk for abuse and other adverse effects. This study examined whether the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist JWH-018 alters the reinforcing effectiveness of the mu opioid receptor agonist remifentanil in rhesus monkeys (n = 4) using economic demand analyses.              Methods:                    Lever presses delivered intravenous infusions of a drug or drug mixture according to a fixed-ratio schedule. For each condition, the ratio progressively increased in quarter-log unit steps across sessions yielding a demand curve: consumption (infusions obtained) was plotted as a function of price (fixed-ratio value).              Results:                    When available alone, remifentanil (0.00032 mg/kg/infusion) occasioned the highest consumption at the lowest cost and highest essential value, while JWH-018 (0.0032 mg/kg/infusion) alone occasioned lower unconstrained demand and essential value. Unconstrained demand for a mixture of remifentanil and JWH-018 was lower than for remifentanil alone, but essential value of the mixture was not significantly different from that of remifentanil alone.              Conclusion:                    These data indicate that synthetic cannabinoids such as JWH-018 might alter some aspects of opioid self-administration (i.e., decreased consumption at the lowest price) but do not enhance reinforcing effectiveness as measured by sensitivity of consumption to increasing costs. Opioid/cannabinoid mixtures do not appear to have greater or lesser abuse potential compared with opioids alone.",-1
Renoprotective effects of ferric citrate in a mouse model of chronic kidney disease,"In chronic kidney disease, ferric citrate has been shown to be an effective phosphate binder and source of enteral iron; however, the effects of ferric citrate on the kidney have been less well-studied. Here, in Col4Î±3 knockout mice-a murine model of progressive chronic kidney disease, we evaluated the effects of five weeks of 1% ferric citrate dietary supplementation. As expected, ferric citrate lowered serum phosphate concentrations and increased serum iron levels in the Col4Î±3 knockout mice. Consistent with decreased enteral phosphate absorption and possibly improved iron status, ferric citrate greatly reduced circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 levels. Interestingly, ferric citrate also lessened systemic inflammation, improved kidney function, reduced albuminuria, and decreased kidney inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting renoprotective effects of ferric citrate in the setting of chronic kidney disease. The factors mediating possible ferric citrate renoprotection, the mechanisms by which they may act, and whether ferric citrate affects chronic kidney disease progression in humans deserves further study.",-1
Reproducibility of individual effect sizes in meta-analyses in psychology,"To determine the reproducibility of psychological meta-analyses, we investigated whether we could reproduce 500 primary study effect sizes drawn from 33 published meta-analyses based on the information given in the meta-analyses, and whether recomputations of primary study effect sizes altered the overall results of the meta-analysis. Results showed that almost half (k = 224) of all sampled primary effect sizes could not be reproduced based on the reported information in the meta-analysis, mostly because of incomplete or missing information on how effect sizes from primary studies were selected and computed. Overall, this led to small discrepancies in the computation of mean effect sizes, confidence intervals and heterogeneity estimates in 13 out of 33 meta-analyses. We provide recommendations to improve transparency in the reporting of the entire meta-analytic process, including the use of preregistration, data and workflow sharing, and explicit coding practices.",-1
Simple Congenital Hamartoma of Retinal Pigment Epithelium,"A 45-year female presented in the Outpatient Department of a tertiary care hospital of Lahore with dimness of vision in the right eye. Her history revealed that the patient had noticed decreased vision since her childhood. Fundus examination revealed a jet-black slightly raised lesion about the size of Â¼-disc diameter, located in the centre of macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a highly hyper-reflective lesion at the fovea with sharp steep shadowing of the underlying structures due to backscattering. We excluded congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) from our differential diagnosis, as solitary CHRPE is a flat well-demarcated lesion at the level of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Adenoma of RPE was eliminated as it has a large feeding and draining blood vessels with intra- and sub-retinal exudation. Choroid and surrounding retina was normal in our patient, which was helpful in differentiating it from choroidal nevus/choroidal melanoma. Our final diagnosis was simple congenital hamartoma of RPE. Key Words: Hamartoma, Retinal pigment epithelium, Macula.",-1
"Efficacy and safety of an orally administered DGAT2 inhibitor alone or coadministered with a liver-targeted ACC inhibitor in adults with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): rationale and design of the phase II, dose-ranging, dose-finding, randomised, placebo-controlled MIRNA (Metabolic Interventions to Resolve NASH with fibrosis) study","Introduction:                    Small molecule inhibitors of the terminal step in intrahepatic triglyceride synthesis (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitor (DGAT2i, PF-06865571, ervogastat)) and upstream blockade of de novo lipogenesis via acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibitor (ACCi, PF-05221304, clesacostat) showed promise in reducing hepatic steatosis in early clinical trials. This study assesses efficacy and safety of these metabolic interventions to resolve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis.              Methods and analysis:                    This phase II, randomised, dose-ranging, dose-finding study evaluates DGAT2i 25-300 mg two times per day (BID) or 150-300 mg once a day, DGAT2i 150-300 mg BID+ACCi 5-10 mg BID coadministration or matching placebo in a planned 450 adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH and liver fibrosis stages 2-3 from approximately 220 sites in 11 countries across North America, Europe and Asia. A triage approach including double-confirmation via non-invasive markers is included prior to screening/baseline liver biopsy. On confirmation of histological diagnosis, participants enter a â?-week run-in period, then a 48-week double-blind, double-dummy dosing period. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants achieving histological NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis, â? stage improvement in fibrosis without worsening NASH, or both, assessed by central pathologists. Other endpoints include assessment of hepatic steatosis (imaging substudy), overall safety and tolerability, and evaluation of blood-based biomarkers and quantitative ultrasound parameters over time.

"Circular RNA PLCE1 promotes epithelial mesenchymal transformation, glycolysis in colorectal cancer and M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages","Plentiful studies have clarified that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are crucial in colorectal cancer (CRC)'s occurrence and development, but its function has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological functions of circPLCE1 on epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and glycolysis in CRC, and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization. The results affirmed augment of circPLCE1 and Î³-Actin Gene (ACTG1) but decline of miR-485-5p in CRC. Knockdown circPCLE1 refrained CRC proliferation, glucose consumption, lactic acid and pyruvate production, M2 macrophage markers (IL-10, MRC1), N-cadherin, Snail, reduced the proportion of CD206+ and CD168+ macrophages, but expedited M1 macrophage markers (TNF-Î±, IL-6) and E-cadherin, while descending miR-485-5p expedited EMT, glycolysis in CRC and TAM M2 polarization . Additionally, it was affirmed that the repression or motivation of depressive or elevated circPCLE1 on EMT, glycolysis in CRC and TAM M2 polarization were reversed via facilitated ACTG1 and miR-485-5p, separately. Mechanism studies have clarified that circPCLE1 as a competitive endogenous RNA adsorbed miR-485-5p to mediate ACTG1. It was assured that refrained circPCLE1 constrained CRC tumor growth, EMT and TAM M2 polarization. In brief, circPCLE1 expedites EMT, glycolysis in CRC and TAM M2 polarization via modulating the miR-485-5p/ACTG1 axis, and is supposed to be a latent molecular target for CRC therapy later.",-1
Breath methane to hydrogen ratio as a surrogate marker of intestinal dysbiosis in head and neck cancer,"Exhaled breath compounds can non-invasively detect head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here we investigated exhaled compounds related to intestinal bacterial carbohydrate fermentation. Fasting breath samples were collected into 3 litre FlexFoil PLUS bags from patients awaiting a biopsy procedure for suspected HNSCC. Samples were analysed using a Syft selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometer and a Quintron BreathTracker. Two tailed non-parametric significance testing was conducted with corrections for multiple imputations. 74 patients were diagnosed (histological) with HNSCC and 61 patients were benign (controls). The methane to hydrogen ratio was significantly different between cancer and non-cancer controls (p = 0.0440). This ratio increased with tumour stage with a significant difference between T1 and T4 tumours (p = 0.0259). Hydrogen levels were significantly higher in controls who were smokers (p = 0.0129), with no smoking dependent methane changes. There were no differences in short chain fatty acids between groups. Exhaled compounds of intestinal carbohydrate fermentation can detect HNSCC patients. These findings suggest a modified carbohydrate fermentation profile in HNSCC patients that is tumour stage and smoking status dependent.",-1
Diet Quality and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: The Rotterdam Study,"The Mediterranean diet has been associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), but limited research has been performed on other dietary patterns. We studied the relationship between overall diet quality and PD risk in the general population. We included 9414 participants from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based study in the Netherlands. Diet was defined using a Dutch diet quality score, a Mediterranean diet score and data-driven dietary patterns constructed with principal component analysis (PCA). During an average follow-up of 14.1 years, PD was diagnosed in 129 participants. We identified a 'Prudent', 'Unhealthy' and 'Traditional Dutch' pattern from the PCA. We found a possible association between the Mediterranean diet (Hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation (SD) 0.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.07)), the 'Prudent' pattern (HR per SD 0.81 (95% CI 0.61-1.08)) and the risk of PD. However, no associations with PD risk were found for the Dutch diet quality score (HR per SD 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.12)), the 'Unhealthy' pattern (HR per SD 1.05 (95% CI 0.85-1.29)) or the 'Traditional Dutch' pattern (HR per SD 0.90 (95% CI 0.69-1.17)). In conclusion, our results corroborate previous findings of a possible protective effect of the Mediterranean diet. Further research is warranted to study the effect of other dietary patterns on PD risk.",-1
Children's use of race and gender as cues to social status,"Social hierarchies are ubiquitous and determine a range of developmental outcomes, yet little is known about when children develop beliefs about status hierarchies in their communities. The present studies (3.5-6.9 years; N = 420) found that children begin to use gender and race as cues to status in early childhood, but that gender and race related to different status dimensions and had different consequences for inter-group attitudes. Children expected boys to hold higher status as defined by access to resources and decision-making power (e.g., having more toys and choosing what other people play with) but did not expect boys to have more wealth overall. Gender-related status beliefs did not relate to gender-related social preferences; instead, children preferred members of their own gender, regardless of their status beliefs. In contrast, children expected White people to be wealthier than Black people, and among some populations of children, the belief that White people were higher status (as defined by access to resources and decision-making power) weakly related to pro-White bias. Children's status-expectations about others were unrelated to beliefs about their own status, suggesting children more readily apply category-based status beliefs to others than to themselves.",-1
Larvicidal activity of Maytenus guianensis (Celastraceae) against Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae),"Introduction:                    Bioprospection of plant products is used to discover new insecticides.              Methods:                    The larvicidal activity of ethanolic extract and triterpene (tingenone B) from the bark of Maytenus guianensis and their effect on pupation and emergence were evaluated against Aedes aegypti.              Results:                    Crude extract LC50 was 11.3 ppm and caused ejection of the larvae intestine; tingenone B LC50 was 14.8 ppm. Pupation was reduced by 20% and 10%, respectively; however, the emergence was not affected.              Conclusions:                    The crude bark extract exhibited a higher larvicidal effect against the vector.",-1
Occupational Performance and Hand Function in People With Parkinson's Disease After Participation in Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) BIGÂ®,"Importance:                    People with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience motor and functional impairment that can negatively affect daily living and participation.              Objective:                    To examine the occupational performance and hand function outcomes of people with PD who participated in a Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) BIGÂ® program.              Design:                    Retrospective record review.              Setting:                    Outcomes were extracted from patient charts at a hospital outpatient clinic.              Participants:                    Sixty-six clinic outpatients with PD who completed the LSVT BIG program.              Intervention:                    An occupational therapist and a physical therapist who were certified in LSVT BIG administration delivered the 16-session LSVT BIG program. Outcomes and Measures: The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), grip strength, and Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT) were administered before and after participation in LSVT BIG training.              Results:                    For participant-identified COPM goals, pre-post changes were significant, ranging from 3 to 6 points for performance and satisfaction (p < .001). Grip strength in both hands showed significant gains; median scores for the right hand increased from 55.0 lb (interquartile range [IQR] 41.0, 70.0) to 64.0 lb (IQR 46.0, 80.0; p < .001) and for the left hand from 52.0 lb (IQR 39.0, 64.0) to 63.0 lb (IQR 44.5, 79.5; p < .001). MMDT median scores for right to left also significantly improved, from 124.0 s (IQR 113.0, 181.0) to 119.5 s (IQR 105.5, 163.5; p = .014).              Conclusions and relevance:                    Participation in the LSVT BIG program can improve perceived occupational performance and satisfaction and produce gains in hand strength and dexterity for people with PD. What This Article Adds: This study is the first retrospective review of data on occupational performance and hand function outcomes after participation in the LSVT BIG program. The findings of beneficial outcomes support the use of LSVT BIG in occupational therapy services to increase functional abilities among people with PD.",-1
Meta-Analysis of the Association between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and Colorectal Cancer,"The Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) was extensively used to examine the inflammatory potential of diet related to colorectal cancer (CRC). This meta-analysis aimed to update the evidence of the association between the DII and CRC across various culture-specific dietary patterns. Literature search was performed through online databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and EBSCOHost). Observational studies exploring the association between the DII and CRC, published between 2017 and 2021, were included. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were separately computed for 12 studies comparing the highest and lowest DII scores and for 3 studies that presented continuous DII scores. A high DII score was associated with a higher risk of CRC (RR:1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27). In the subgroup analysis, significant associations were seen in cohort design (RR: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.44), those lasting for 10 years or longer (RR: 2.95; 95% CI, 2.47-3.52), and in adjustment factor for physical activity (RR: 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.20). An increase of one point in the DII score elevates the risk of CRC by 1.34 (95% CI: 1.15-1.55) times. The findings call for standardized measurement of the inflammatory potential of diet in future studies to enable the establishment of global guidelines for CRC prevention.",-1
Meta-analysis and machine learning to explore soil-water partitioning of common pharmaceuticals,"The first meta-analysis and modelling from batch-sorption literature studies of the soil/water partitioning of pharmaceuticals is presented. Analysis of the experimental conditions reported in the literature demonstrated that though batch-sorption studies have value, they are limited in evaluating partitioning under environmentally-relevant conditions. Recommendations are made to utilise environmental relevant pharmaceutical concentrations, perform batch-sorption studies at temperatures other than 4, 20 and 25 Â°C to better reflect climate diversity, and utilise the Guideline 106 methodology as a benchmark to enable comparison between future studies (and support modelling and prediction). The meta-dataset comprised 82 data points, which were modelled using multivariate analysis; where Kd (soil/water partitioning coefficient) was the independent variable. The dependent variables fit into three categories: 1) pharmaceutical studied (including physical-chemical properties), 2) soil characteristics and 3) experimental conditions. The pharmaceutical solubility, the soil/liquid equilibration time (prior to adding the pharmaceutical), the soil organic carbon, the soil sterilisation method and the liquid phase were found to be significantly important variables for predicting Kd.",-1
Distinct hippocampal subfield atrophy in Parkinson's disease regarding motor subtypes,"Introduction:                    Global hippocampal atrophy has been repeatedly reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is limited literature on the differential involvement of hippocampal subfields among PD motor subtypes. This study aimed to investigate hippocampal subfield alterations in patients with PD based on their predominant symptoms.              Method:                    We enrolled 31 PD patients with the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype, 27 PD patients with postural instability and gait disturbance-dominant (PIGD) subtype, and 40 healthy controls (HCs). All participants underwent high-spatial-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The volume of hippocampal subfields was measured using FreeSurfer software, compared across groups, and correlated with clinical features.              Results:                    We found volumetric reductions in the hippocampal subfield in both patient subtypes compared to HCs, which were more pronounced in the PIGD subtype. The PIGD subtype had accelerated age-related alterations in the hippocampus compared to the TD subtype. Bilateral hippocampal volumes were positively associated with cognitive performance levels, but not with disease severity and duration in patients.              Conclusions:                    Alterations in the hippocampal subfields of patients with PD differed based on their predominant symptoms. These findings are of relevance for understanding the pathophysiology of the increased risk of cognitive impairment in PIGD.",-1
LPS-inducible circAtp9b is highly expressed in osteoporosis and promotes the apoptosis of osteoblasts by reducing the formation of mature miR-17-92a,"Background:                    Circular RNA circAtp9b is an enhancer of LPS-induced inflammation, which promotes osteoporosis (OS). This study explored the role of circAtp9b in OS.              Methods:                    RT-qPCR was performed to detect the expression of circAtp9b and microRNA (miR)-17-92a (both mature and premature) in OS and healthy controls. The subcellular location of circAtp9b was assessed by nuclear fractionation assay. The direct interaction between circAtp9b and premature miR-17-92a was detected by RNA pull-down assay. The role of circAtp9b in regulating the maturation of miR-17-92a in osteoblasts was explored by overexpression assay and RT-qPCR. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by cell apoptosis assay.              Results:                    OS patients exhibited upregulation of circAtp9b and premature miR-17-92a, but downregulation of mature miR-17-92a. In osteoblasts, circAtp9b suppressed the maturation of miR-17-92a. LPS upregulated circAtp9b and premature miR-17-92a, and downregulated mature miR-17-92a in osteoblasts. CircAtp9b was detected in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and it directly interacted with premature miR-17-92a. Overexpression of circAtp9b reduced the effects of miR-17-92a on the apoptosis of osteoblasts induced by LPS.              Conclusion:                    CircAtp9b is LPS-inducible and upregulation of circAtp9b in OS promotes the apoptosis of osteoblasts by reducing the formation of mature miR-17-92a.",-1
Physics and applications of squid-inspired jetting,"In the aquatic world jet propulsion is a highly successful locomotion method utilized by a variety of species. Among them cephalopods such as squids excel in their ability for high-speed swimming. This mechanism inspires the development of underwater locomotion techniques which are particularly useful in soft-bodied robots. In this overview we summarize existing studies on this topic, ranging from investigations on the underlying physics to the creation of mechanical systems utilizing this locomotion mode. Research directions that worth future investigation are also discussed.",-1
Exercise-Induced Changes in Visceral Adipose Tissue Mass Are Regulated by IL-6 Signaling: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Visceral adipose tissue is harmful to metabolic health. Exercise training reduces visceral adipose tissue mass, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulates lipolysis and is released from skeletal muscle during exercise. We hypothesized that exercise-induced reductions in visceral adipose tissue mass are mediated by IL-6. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, we assigned abdominally obese adults to tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antibody) or placebo during a 12-week intervention with either bicycle exercise or no exercise. While exercise reduced visceral adipose tissue mass, this effect of exercise was abolished in the presence of IL-6 blockade. Changes in body weight and total adipose tissue mass showed similar tendencies, whereas lean body mass did not differ between groups. Also, IL-6 blockade increased cholesterol levels, an effect not reversed by exercise. Thus, IL-6 is required for exercise to reduce visceral adipose tissue mass and emphasizes a potentially important metabolic consequence of IL-6 blockade.",-1
Current and Future Role of Neoadjuvant Chemoimmunotherapy for Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Which Way to Go Forward,"Immunotherapy has revolutionized previous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) treatment algorithms, prompting researchers and clinicians to consider the expansion of the role of immunotherapy in other settings, including the earlier stage of the disease (e.g., as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy). The role of chemoimmunotherapy have been assessed in some recently presented and published clinical trials, including the KEYNOTE-522, the IMpassion031, and the GeparNUEVO. In the current Editorial, we will provide a critical snapshot of these studies, exploring strengths and limitations of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in early TNBC.",-1
Elevated Lipoprotein(a) as a potential residual risk factor associated with lipid-rich coronary atheroma in patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease on statin treatment: Insights from the REASSURE-NIRS registry,"Background and aims:                    The residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in patients with diabetes on statin therapy warrants identification of other pro-atherogenic drivers. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] promotes the formation of necrotic cores within vessel walls. Given that patients with diabetes have an Lp(a)-associated ASCVD risk, Lp(a) might lead to plaque vulnerability in patients with diabetes on statin therapy.              Methods:                    We analyzed target lesions that underwent PCI in 312 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) on statin treatment from the REASSURE-NIRS registry (NCT04864171). Maximum 4-mm lipid-core-burden index (maxLCBI4mm) in target lesions was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) imaging. The relationship between Lp(a) levels and maxLCBI4mm was investigated in patients with and without diabetes.              Results:                    High-intensity statin use (p = 0.49) and on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p = 0.32) and Lp(a) levels (p = 0.09) were comparable between patients with and without diabetes. Lp(a) levels were significantly associated with maxLCBI4mm in patients with diabetes (p = 0.01) but not in patients without diabetes (p = 0.96). Multivariate analysis showed that LDL-C levels (p = 0.03) predict maxLCBI4mm in patients without diabetes, but not Lp(a) levels (p = 0.91). Both LDL-C (p = 0.01) and Lp(a) (p = 0.04) levels were independent predictors of maxLCBI4mm in patients with diabetes. Even in patients with diabetes achieving LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), Lp(a) levels remained associated with maxLCBI4mm (p = 0.04).              Conclusions:                    A significant relationship between Lp(a) and maxLCBI4mm exists in patients with diabetes and CAD on statin treatment, even with LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Lp(a) might be associated with more vulnerable coronary atheroma in patients with diabetes despite receiving statin therapy.",-1
YTHDF1 Negatively Regulates Treponema pallidum-Induced Inflammation in THP-1 Macrophages by Promoting SOCS3 Translation in an m6A-Dependent Manner,"Background:                    Previous studies have confirmed that the bacterium Treponema pallidum (TP) or its proteins provide signals to macrophages that induce an inflammatory response; however, little is known about the negative regulation of this macrophage-mediated inflammatory response during syphilis infection or the underlying mechanism. Recent evidence suggests the role of the RNA modification, N6-adenosine methylation (m6A), in regulating the inflammatory response and pathogen-host cell interactions. Therefore, we hypothesized that m6A plays a role in the regulation of the inflammatory response in macrophages exposed to TP.              Methods:                    We first assessed m6A levels in TP-infected macrophages differentiated from the human monocyte cell line THP-1. The binding and interaction between the m6A ""writer"" methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) or the m6A ""reader"" YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing protein YTHDF1 and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), as a major regulator of the inflammatory response, were explored in differentiated TP-infected THP-1 cells as well as in secondary syphilitic lesions from patients. The mechanisms by which YTHDF1 and SOCS3 regulate the inflammatory response in macrophages were assessed.              Results and conclusion:                    After macrophages were stimulated by TP, YTHDF1 was upregulated in the cells. YTHDF1 was also upregulated in the syphilitic lesions compared to adjacent tissue in patients. YTHDF1 recognizes and binds to the m6A methylation site of SOCS3 mRNA, consequently promoting its translation, thereby inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, and reducing the secretion of inflammatory factors, which results in anti-inflammatory regulation. This study provides the first demonstration of the role of m6A methylation in the pathological process of syphilis and further offers new insight into the pathogenesis of TP infection.",-1
Preparing Irradiated and Marked Male Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes for Release in an Operational Sterile Insect Technique Program,"The control of such human diseases as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya relies on the control of their vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, because there is no prevention. Control of mosquito vectors can rely on chemicals applied to the immature and adult stages, which can contribute to the mortality of non-targets and more importantly, lead to insecticide resistance in the vector. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a method of controlling populations of pests through the release of sterilized adult males that mate with wild females to produce non-viable offspring. This paper describes the process of producing sterile males for use in an operational SIT program for the control of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Outlined here are the steps used in the program including rearing and maintaining a colony, separating male and female pupae, irradiating and marking adult males, and shipping Aedes aegypti males to the release site. Also discussed are procedural caveats, program limitations, and future objectives.",-1
Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 02381 Promotes the Proliferation and Invasion of Ovarian Endometrial Stromal Cells through the miR-27b-3p/CTNNB1 Axis,"Purpose:                    Catenin Beta 1 (CTNNB1) is a key regulator of cell proliferation and invasion in endometriosis; however, its upstream factor is not clear. Long noncoding RNAs may participate in endometriosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of interaction between LINC02381 and CTNNB1 in endometriosis.              Method:                    Screening and validation of RNAs were completed by whole transcriptional sequencing and qRT-PCR. The subcellular localization of LINC02381 was determined by RNA in situ hybridization and nucleo-cytoplasmic separation. Plasmids were transfected for functional experiments. Luciferase assay was used to verify the binding relationship.              Results:                    The expression of LINC02381 and CTNNB1 was significantly increased in ovarian ectopic endometrial tissues (OSAs) and ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs). When LINC02381 was downregulated in ESCs, the expression of CTNNB1, metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and cyclinD1, as well as ESCs invasion and proliferation, decreased. LINC02381 was mainly present in the cytoplasm of ESCs, indicating that it may act as a competitive endogenous RNA. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that microRNA-27b-3p (miR-27b-3p) is a downstream target of LINC02381. miR-27b-3p decreased in OSAs and ESCs. Moreover, when miR-27b-3p was upregulated in ESCs, the expression of CTNNB1, MMP9 and cyclinD1, as well as the invasion and proliferation ability of ESCs, were reduced. Additionally, rescue experiments demonstrated that the expression of CTNNB1, MMP9 and cyclinD1, as well as the invasion and proliferation ability, were significantly increased in the group transfected with both sh-LINC02381 and a miR-27b-3p inhibitor.              Conclusion:                    LINC02381 upregulated CTNNB1 by adsorbing miR-27b-3p, causing increased proliferation and invasion of ESCs.",-1
Effectiveness of HIIE versus MICT in Improving Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Health and Disease: A Meta-analysis,"Purpose:                    We aimed to investigate differences between high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE, including high-intensity interval training and sprint interval training) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on physical fitness, body composition, blood pressure, blood lipids, insulin and glucose metabolism, inflammation, and endothelial function.              Methods:                    Differences between HIIE and MICT were summarized using a random-effects meta-analysis on the effect size (Cohen's d). A meta-regression was conducted using the following subgroups: population, age, training duration, men ratio, exercise type, baseline values (clinical relevant ranges), and type of HIIE. Studies were included if at least one of the following outcomes were reported: maximal oxygen uptake (VËO2max), flow-mediated dilation (FMD), body mass index (BMI), body mass, percent body fat, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting glucose and insulin, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). A total of 55 studies were included.              Results:                    Overall, HIIE was superior to MICT in improving VËO2max (d = 0.40, P < 0.001) and FMD (d = 0.54, P < 0.05). Oppositely, MICT was superior to HIIE in improving HbA1c (d = -0.27, P < 0.05). No differences were observed in BMI (d = -0.02), body mass (d = -0.05), percent body fat (d = 0.04), systolic blood pressure (d = -0.04), diastolic blood pressure (d = 0.03), HDL (d = -0.05), LDL (d = 0.08), triglycerides (d = 0.03), total cholesterol (d = 0.14), CRP (d = -0.11), fasting insulin (d = 0.02), fasting glucose (d = 0.02), and HOMA-IR (d = -0.04). Moderator analyses indicated that the difference between HIIE and MICT was affected by different subgroups.              Conclusion:                    Overall, HIIE showed to be more effective in improving cardiovascular health and cardiorespiratory fitness, whereas MICT was superior in improving long-term glucose metabolism. In the process of personalized training counseling, health-enhancing effects of exercise training may be improved by considering the individual risk profiles.",-1
Sick fat: the good and the bad of old and new circulating markers of adipose tissue inflammation,"Adipose tissue (AT) is one of the largest endocrine organs contributing to metabolic homeostasis. The functional pleiotropism of AT depends on its ability to secrete a large number of hormones, cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors, all influencing many local and systemic physiological and pathophysiological processes. In condition of chronic positive energy balance, adipocyte expansion, hypoxia, apoptosis and stress all lead to AT inflammation and dysfunction, and it has been demonstrated that this sick fat is a main risk factor for many metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, cardiovascular disease and cancer. AT dysfunction is tightly associated with aberrant secretion of bioactive peptides, the adipocytokines, and their blood concentrations often reflect the expression in the AT. Despite the existence of an association between AT dysfunction and systemic pro-inflammatory state, most of the circulating molecules detectable in obese and dysmetabolic individuals do not identify specifically the condition of sick fat. Based on this premise, this review provides a concise overview of ""classic"" and novel promising adipocytokines associated with AT inflammation and discusses possible critical approaches to their interpretation in clinical practice.",-1
"Integration of municipal state, society and university efforts for sanitary risk prevention associated with Aedes aegypti mosquito in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Argentina","The sanitary problem of Aedes aegypti mosquito acquires relevance around the world because it is the vector of dengue, zika, chikungunya and yellow fever. The vector is adapting to southern regions faster, and the propagation of these diseases in urban areas is a complex problem for society. We aimed to contribute to the risk prevention of disease transmission in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires, through monitoring Aedes aegypti population levels and developing education campaigns with government agencies and society participation. Monitoring activities aimed to diagnose the presence of the vector and its ecology behaviour, and to generate education and prevention politics to avoid its propagation. The results show that (1) the mosquito is in the territory and it is spreading, (2) prevention activities of the municipalities are insufficient to generate an effective sanitary response and (3) it is necessary to improve the education programmes to the population about the life cycle of the vector. The integration of university, government and society improved the work of the team because it combined knowledge about vector ecology, diseases and territory characteristics.",-1
"Obesity, visceral adiposity and carotid atherosclerosis","Carotid artery atherosclerosis is a complex and multifactorial chronic disease. Our aim was to assess the associations between obesity, fat depots and carotid artery stenosis (CAS) in patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk.              Methods:                    The study group included 391 patients (F/M: 136/255 pts.; age: 61.8 Â± 8 years) scheduled for elective coronary angiography. A comprehensive clinical assessment included a carotid artery and abdominal ultrasound involving the following fat depots: (1) carotid extra-media thickness (EMT) indexed to the body mass index (perivascular adipose tissue [PVAT]), and (2) abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat.              Results:                    Patients with a â?0% stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA) were older (65.9 Â± 7 vs 60.3 Â± 7 years, p < 0.0001) and had increased PVAT (836 Â± 120 vs 779 Â± 127 Î¼m, p < 0.01) compared to individuals with <50% internal carotid artery stenosis. None of the CAS parameters were associated with any measures of obesity. Multivariable regression model showed that age (p < 0.0001), PVAT (p < 0.0001) and smoking (p = 0.04) were independently associated with the severity of ICA stenosis.              Conclusions:                    Our study showed that carotid extra-media thickness, an index measure of PVAT, is associated with CAS severity. It is a strong and independent predictor of significant ICA stenosis. None of the obesity measurements revealed associations with carotid atherosclerosis.",-1
Stromal cells maintain immune cell homeostasis in adipose tissue via production of interleukin-33,"Obesity is driven by chronic low-grade inflammation resulting from dysregulated immune cell accumulation and function in white adipose tissue (WAT). Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a key cytokine that controls innate and adaptive immune cell activity and immune homeostasis in WAT, although the sources of IL-33 have remained controversial. Here, we show that WAT-resident mesenchyme-derived stromal cells are the dominant producers of IL-33. Adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs) produced IL-33 in all WAT depots, whereas mesothelial cells served as an additional source of IL-33 in visceral WAT. ASPC-derived IL-33 promoted a regulatory circuit that maintained an immune tone in WAT via the induction of group 2 innate lymphoid cell-derived type 2 cytokines and maintenance of eosinophils, whereas mesothelial IL-33 also acted as an alarmin by inducing peritoneal immune response upon infection. Together, these data reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory network between tissue-resident progenitor cells and innate lymphoid cells that maintains immune homeostasis in adipose tissue.",-1
Enhanced insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis using a late embryogenesis abundant peptide co-expression system,"Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a ubiquitous, gram positive, spore-forming bacterium that synthesizes parasporal crystalline inclusions containing crystal protein, some of which are toxic against a wide range of insect orders like caterpillars, beetles, and flies, including mosquitoes. Regarding the biological control of insects, Bt is the mostly used microorganism worldwide and also alternatives to chemical insecticides for environmental conservation. Some strains of Bt are showing a promising activity against a wide variety of mosquito like Aedes, Culex, and Anopheles and so on with extremely damages in the larval midgut and ultimate death. Here, we introduced a late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) peptide co-expression system based on the expression vector pHT01 with a strong ÏA-dependent promoter to enhance the expression of insecticidal crystal proteins in native Bt. Two types of LEA peptide (LEA-II and LEA-K) were designed based on the sequence of group-3 LEA protein, which consists of a repetitive sequence of 11 amino acids. The LEA-II mediated co-expression system enhanced the production of crystal protein 3-fold after 12 h of induction of the peptide with 0.5 mM IPTG. Enhanced expression of crystal protein was confirmed by bioassay using 4th instar Aedes albopictus larvae. This unique approach has great potential to produce bio-pesticides by enhanced crystal protein expression not only for mosquitoes but also for other insects.",-1
Extra Virgin Olive Oil Secoiridoids Modulate the Metabolic Activity of Dacarbazine Pre-Treated and Treatment-Naive Melanoma Cells,"Nowadays, many individuals, whether healthy or diagnosed with disease, tend to expose themselves to various easily accessible natural products in hopes of benefiting their health and well-being. Mediterranean populations have traditionally used olive oil not only in nutrition but also in cosmetics, including skincare. In this study, the phenolic profile-composed of twelve compounds altogether, including the secoiridoids oleocanthal (OCAL) and oleacein (OCEIN)-of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) from autochthonous cultivars from Croatia was determined using 1H qNMR spectroscopy and HPLC-DAD analysis, and its biological activity was investigated in melanoma cell lines. The EVOO with the highest OCEIN content had the strongest anti-cancer activity in A375 melanoma cells and the least toxic effect on the non-cancerous keratocyte cell line (HaCaT). On the other hand, pure OCAL was shown to be more effective and safer than pure OCEIN. Post-treatment with any of the EVOO phenolic extracts (EVOO-PEs) enhanced the anti-cancer effect of the anti-cancerous drug dacarbazine (DTIC) applied in pre-treatment, while they did not compromise the viability of non-cancerous cells. The metastatic melanoma A375M cell line was almost unresponsive to the EVOO-PEs themselves, as well as to pure OCEIN and OCAL. Our results demonstrate that olive oils and/or their compounds may have a potentially beneficial effect on melanoma treatment. However, their usage can be detrimental or futile, especially in healthy cells, due to inadequately applied concentrations/combinations or the presence of resistant cells.",-1
Lipid accumulation product and visceral adiposity Ä±ndex: two new indices to predict metabolic syndrome in chronic kidney disease,"Objective:                    The aim of this study was to assess the ability of lipid accumulation product (LAP) and visceral adiposity index (VAI) to predict metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also aimed to determine whether VAI and LAP indices are superior to traditional body indices such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR).              Patients and methods:                    This study was performed by retrospectively scanning the files of patients with stage 3-5 chronic renal failure who came for nephrology outpatient follow-up between January 2017 and December 2017. Metabolic syndrome was identified using the 2009 harmonized criteria. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to compare the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of each index.              Results:                    247 patients were included in the analyses. The prevalence of MetS was 80.9%. LAP was determined as the optimal predictor in chronic kidney disease patients, with 0.864 AUC in females and 0.908 AUC in males. Optimal cut-off values for LAP were 33.5 in females and 36.6 in males. VAI was the second most optimal predictor, with 0.856 AUC in females and 0.888 AUC in males. Optimal cut-off values for VAI were 2.24 in females and 1.56 in males.              Conclusions:                    LAP and VAI are effective indices for the prediction of MetS in patients with chronic kidney disease; LAP is the best index for the determination of MetS in both men and women.",-1
miR-22-3p and miR-30e-5p Are Associated with Prognosis in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Alteration in expression of miRNAs can cause various malignant changes and the metastatic process. Our aim was to identify the miRNAs involved in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and metastasis, and to test their utility as indicators of metastasis and survival. Using microarray technology, we performed miRNA expression profiling on primary cervical SqCC tissue (n = 6) compared with normal control (NC) tissue and compared SqCC that had (SqC-M; n = 3) and had not (SqC-NM; n = 3) metastasized. Four miRNAs were selected for validation by qRT-PCR on 29 SqC-NM and 27 SqC-M samples, and nine metastatic lesions (ML-SqC), from a total of 56 patients. Correlation of miRNA expression and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed to evaluate the clinical impact of candidate miRNAs. We found 40 miRNAs differentially altered in cervical SqCC tissue: 21 miRNAs were upregulated and 19 were downregulated (â?-fold, p &lt; 0.05). Eight were differentially altered in SqC-M compared with SqC-NM samples: four were upregulated (miR-494, miR-92a-3p, miR-205-5p, and miR-221-3p), and four were downregulated (miR-574-3p, miR-4769-3p, miR-1281, and miR-1825) (â?.5-fold, p &lt; 0.05). MiR-22-3p might be a metastamiR, which was gradually further downregulated in SqC-NM &gt; SqC-M &gt; ML-SqC. Downregulation of miR-30e-5p significantly correlated with high stage, lymph node metastasis, and low survival rate, suggesting an independent poor prognostic factor.",-1
"Hybrid, ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing enables genomic and functional characterization of low-abundance species in the human gut microbiome","A large number of microbial genomes have already been identified from the human gut microbiome, but the understanding of the role of the low-abundance species at the individual level remains challenging, largely due to the relatively shallow sequencing depth used in most studies. To improve genome assembling performance, a HiSeq-PacBio hybrid, ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing approach was used to reconstruct metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 12 fecal samples. Such approach combined third-generation sequencing with ultra-deep second-generation sequencing to improve the sequencing coverage of the low-abundance subpopulation in the gut microbiome. Our study generated a total of 44 megabase-scale scaffolds, achieving four single-scaffolds of complete (circularized, no gaps) MAGs (CMAGs) that were the first circular genomes of their species. Moreover, 475 high-quality MAGs were assembled across all samples. Among them, 234 MAGs were currently uncultured, including 24 MAGs that were not found in any public genome database. Additionally, 287 and 77 MAGs were classified as low-abundance (0.1-1%) and extra-low-abundance (<0.1%) gut species in each individual, respectively. Our results also revealed individual-specific genomic features in the MAG profiles, including microbial genome growth rate, selective pressure, and frequency of chromosomal mobile genetic elements. Finally, thousands of extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements were identified from the metagenomic data, including 5097 bacteriophages and 79 novel plasmid genomes. Overall, our strategy represents an important step toward comprehensive genomic and functional characterization of the human gut microbiome at an individual level.",-1
Discriminating arboviral species,"Mosquito-borne arboviruses, including a diverse array of alphaviruses and flaviviruses, lead to hundreds of millions of human infections each year. Current methods for species-level classification of arboviruses adhere to guidelines prescribed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), and generally apply a polyphasic approach that might include information about viral vectors, hosts, geographical distribution, antigenicity, levels of DNA similarity, disease association and/or ecological characteristics. However, there is substantial variation in the criteria used to define viral species, which can lead to the establishment of artificial boundaries between species and inconsistencies when inferring their relatedness, variation and evolutionary history. In this study, we apply a single, uniform principle - that underlying the Biological Species Concept (BSC) - to define biological species of arboviruses based on recombination between genomes. Given that few recombination events have been documented in arboviruses, we investigate the incidence of recombination within and among major arboviral groups using an approach based on the ratio of homoplastic sites (recombinant alleles) to non-homoplastic sites (vertically transmitted alleles). This approach supports many ICTV-designations but also recognizes several cases in which a named species comprises multiple biological species. These findings demonstrate that this metric may be applied to all lifeforms, including viruses, and lead to more consistent and accurate delineation of viral species.",-1
Blocking of NFâkB/p38 MAPK pathways mitigates oligodendrocyte pathology in a model of neonatal white matter injury,"Reactive gliosis and inflammation are risk factors for white matter injury (WMI) development, which are correlated with the development of many neurodevelopmental deficits with no treatment. This study aimed to understand the mechanisms correlated with WMI, with a particular focus on the role of nuclear factorâkappa B (NFâkB) and p38 mitogenâactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways. Sevenâdayâold Wistar rats were used to generate cerebellar tissue slices. Slices were cultured and randomly allocated to one of 3 groups and treated as follows: groupâI (control); groupâII (WMI), slices were subjected to 20 min of oxygenâglucose deprivation (OGD); groupâIII (WMI+ blockers), slices were subjected to OGD and treated with the blockers. Results showed that OGD insult triggered a marked increase in the apoptosis among WM elements, as confirmed by TUNEL assay. Immunocytochemical experiments revealed that there was a significant decrease in the percent of MBP+ OLs and NG2+ OPCs, and myelin integrity. There was also a significant increase in the percent of reactive microglia and astrocytes. BrdU immunostaining revealed there was an increase in the percent of proliferating microglia and astrocytes. QâRTâPCR results showed OGD upregulated the expression levels of cytokines (TNFâÎ? ILâ?, ILâ?, and ILâ?Î²) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). On the other hand, treatment with BAY11 or SB203580 significantly enhanced the OL survival, restored myelin loss, and reduced microglia and astrocyte reactivity, and downregulated the iNOS and cytokine expression. Our findings demonstrate that blocking of NFâKB/p38 MAPK pathways alleviated reactive gliosis, inflammation, and OL loss upon WMI. The findings may help to develop therapeutic interventions for WMI.",-1
Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes and Pathways for Abdominal Fat Deposition in Ovariectomized and Sham-Operated Chickens,"Ovariectomy results in improved meat quality (growth rate, tenderness, and flavor) of broilers. However, some negative effects increased (abdominal fat (AF) deposition, low feed conversion, etc.) have also been reported. In this study, the gene expression profiles of AF tissue in ovariectomized and sham-operated chickens were determined to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying AF accumulation. Comparing the ovariectomized group and the sham-operated group, the abdominal fat weight (AFW) and abdominal fat percentage (AFP) were increased significantly (p < 0.05) at 14 and 19 weeks after ovariectomy. According to the gene expression profiling analysis, 108 DEGs of fat metabolism were screened from 1461 DEGs. Among them, ABCA1, ABCACA, LPL, CREB1, PNPLA2, which are involved in glycerolipid-or steroid-associated biological processes, and the hormone receptor genes, ESR1 and PRLR, were down-regulated significantly in the ovariectomized group compared to the sham-operated group (p < 0.05). Conversely, CETP, DGAT2, DHCR24, HSD17B7 and MSMO1, were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05) after ovariectomy. Based on the DEGs, the glycerolipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and other signaling pathways (MAPK, TGF-Î², and adhesion pathways, etc.) were enriched, which may also contribute to the regulation of AF deposition. Our data suggest that AF deposition was significantly increased in ovariectomized chickens by the down-regulation of the decomposition genes of glycerolipid metabolism, which inhibits AF degradation, and the up-regulation of steroid biosynthesis genes, which increases fat accumulation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of fat deposition in the ovariectomized chickens.",-1
miR-200c suppression increases tau hyperphosphorylation by targeting 14-3-3Î³ in early stage of 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Background and Purpose: Recently, several abnormally regulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study was to identify abnormally expressed miRNAs and to investigate whether they affect pathological changes in AD in the 5xFAD AD mouse model. Experimental Approach: Using microarray analysis and RT-qPCR, miRNA expression in the hippocampus of a 4-month-old 5xFAD mouse model of AD was investigated. A dual-luciferase assay was performed to determine whether the altered miR-200c regulates the translation of the target mRNA, Ywhag. Whether miR-200c modulates AD pathology was determined in primary hippocampal neurons and C57BL/6J mice transfected with miR-200c inhibitor. In addition, total miRNAs were extracted from the serums of 28 healthy age-matched controls and 22 individual participants with cognitive impairment, and RT-qPCR was performed. Key results: miR-200c expression was reduced in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. In primary hippocampal neurons, miR-200c regulated the translation of 14-3-3Î³ and increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau) by increasing p-GSK-3Î² (GSK-3Î² phosphorylation). It was also confirmed that miR-200c inhibition in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice induces cognitive impairment and increases tau phosphorylation through 14-3-3Î³ activation. Finally, aberrant expression of miR-200c was confirmed in the blood serum of human AD patients. Conclusion and Implications: Our results strongly suggest that dysregulation of miR-200c expression contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, including cognitive impairment through hyperphosphorylated tau.",-1
LINC00092 Suppresses the Malignant Progression of Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Through Modulating SFRP1 Expression by Sponging miR-1827,"Breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a most common kind of breast cancer (BC), yet to date the corresponding effective therapies are limited. Extensive evidence has indicated that lncRNAs are involved in multiple cancers, and the potential mechanism of lncRNAs, such as LINC00092, mentioned in IDC remains elusive. IDC clinical samples from TCGA database were used to analyze the expression levels of LINC00092, miR-1827 and SFRP1. Kaplan-Meier method was applied to plot the overall survival curves. KEGG and GO were employed to screen the pathway that LINC00092 participated in. Pearson's correlation analysis determined the relationship between LINC00092 and SFRP1. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay examined the association among LINC00092, miR-1827, and SFRP1. Cell counting kit-8, colony formation and transwell assays were performed to detect cell viability, colony formation, and migration and invasion, respectively. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot were utilized to investigate the expression at RNA and protein levels. LINC00092 expression was down-regulated in IDC tissues and cells, which was correlated with poor prognosis. Down-regulated LINC00092 facilitated cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration and invasion, while up-regulated LINC00092 inhibited cell malignant behaviors. LINC00092/SFRP1 physically bound to miR-1827 in IDC. SFRP1 expression was proportional to LINC00092 expression and inversely proportional to miR-1827 expression. The inhibitory effects of LINC00092 on cell aggressive behaviors were partially regulated by miR-1827/SFRP1. In summary, our results indicated that overexpression of LINC00092 inhibited the development of IDC through modulating miR-1827/SFRP1 axis, suggesting new therapeutic targets to treat IDC.",-1
Biopsychosocial and Nutritional Factors of Depression among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Systematic Review,"The rising prevalence of depression among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients has triggered an alarming situation, and further actions need to be taken by health care professionals and policymakers to curb the issue. There is a lack of evidence review in terms of the biopsychosocial and nutritional factors that are related to depression among T2DM. Hence, this review aimed to identify available evidence on the biopsychosocial and nutritional factors associated with depression among T2DM patients based on the existing literature. Articles were systematically searched from four databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOHost. The approach for the identification of the final articles followed PRISMA guidelines. The selected full-text articles were published between 2017 and 2021 in the English language, and included studies focused on depression among T2DM patients. Using AXIS tools, the eligible articles were evaluated to assess the quality of studies. A total of 19 studies were included in the review, and information related to research questions and associated factors was extracted. Biological, psychological, social, and nutritional factors were shown to be linked with depression among T2DM patients. Future studies need to considered using the biopsychosocial model and incorporating nutritional factors to manage the issues of depression among T2DM patients.",-1
MicroRNA-134-5p and the Extent of Arterial Occlusive Disease Are Associated with Risk of Future Adverse Cardiac and Cerebral Events in Diabetic Patients Undergoing Carotid Artery Stenting for Symptomatic Carotid Artery Disease,"There is little known about the prognostic value of serum microRNAs (miRs) in diabetic patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery disease (ICAS) who underwent stent supported angioplasty (PTA) for ICAS. The present study aimed to investigate expression levels of selected miRs for future major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE) as a marker in diabetic patients following ICAS-PTA. The expression levels of 11 chosen circulating serum miRs were compared in 37 diabetic patients with symptomatic ICAS and 64 control group patients with symptomatic ICAS, but free of diabetes. The prospective median follow-up of 84 months was performed for cardiovascular outcomes. Diabetic patients, as compared to control subjects, did not differ with respect to age (p = 0.159), distribution of gender (p = 0.375), hypertension (p = 0.872), hyperlipidemia (p = 0.203), smoking (p = 0.115), coronary heart disease (p = 0.182), lower extremities arterial disease (LEAD, p = 0.731), and miRs expressions except from lower miR-16-5p (p &lt; 0.001). During the follow-up period, MACCE occurred in 16 (43.2%) diabetic and 26 (40.6%) non-diabetic patients (p = 0.624). On multivariate Cox analysis, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) for diabetic patients associated with MACCE were miR-134-5p (1.12; 1.05-1.21, p &lt; 0.001), miR-499-5p (0.16; 0.02-1.32, p = 0.089), hs-CRP (1.14; 1.02-1.28; p = 0.022), prior myocardial infarction (8.56, 1.91-38.3, p = 0.004), LEAD (11.9; 2.99-47.9, p = 0.005), and RAS (20.2; 2.4-167.5, p = 0.005), while in non-diabetic subjects, only miR-16-5p (1.0006; 1.0001-1.0012, p = 0.016), miR-208b-3p (2.82; 0.91-8.71, p = 0.071), and hypertension (0.27, 0.08-0.95, p = 0.042) were associated with MACCE. Our study demonstrated that different circulating miRs may be prognostic for MACCE in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients with symptomatic ICAS. Higher expression levels of miR-134 were prognostic for MACCE in diabetic patients, while higher expression levels of miR-16 were prognostic in non-diabetic patients.",-1
Fumonisin B 2 Induces Mitochondrial Stress and Mitophagy in Human Embryonic Kidney (Hek293) Cells-A Preliminary Study,"Ubiquitous soil fungi parasitise agricultural commodities and produce mycotoxins. Fumonisin B2 (FB2), the structural analogue of the commonly studied Fumonisin B1 (FB1), is a neglected mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species. Mycotoxins are known for inducing toxicity via mitochondrial stress alluding to mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy). These processes involve inter-related pathways that are regulated by proteins related to SIRT3 and Nrf2. This study aimed to investigate mitochondrial stress responses in human kidney (Hek293) cells exposed to FB2 for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed via the methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 317.4 Âµmol/L) was estimated using statistical software. Reactive oxygen species (ROS; H2DCFDA), mitochondrial membrane depolarisation (JC1-mitoscreen) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP; luminometry) levels were evaluated to assess mitochondrial integrity. The relative expression of mitochondrial stress response proteins (SIRT3, pNrf2, LONP1, PINK1, p62 and HSP60) was determined by Western blot. Transcript levels of SIRT3, PINK1 and miR-27b were assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). FB2 reduced ATP production (p = 0.0040), increased mitochondrial stress marker HSP60 (p&amp;nbsp;= 0.0140) and suppressed upregulation of mitochondrial stress response proteins SIRT3 (p&amp;nbsp;= 0.0026) and LONP1 (p&amp;nbsp;= 0.5934). FB2 promoted mitophagy via upregulation of pNrf2 (p = 0.0008), PINK1 (p = 0.0014) and p62 (p &lt; 0.0001) protein expression. FB2 also suppressed miR-27b expression (p &lt; 0.0001), further promoting the occurrence of mitophagy. Overall, the findings suggest that FB2 increases mitochondrial stress and promotes mitophagy in Hek293 cells.",-1
Predicting Chronological Age from DNA Methylation Data: A Machine Learning Approach for Small Datasets and Limited Predictors,"Recent research studies using epigenetic data have been exploring whether it is possible to estimate how old someone is using only their DNA. This application stems from the strong correlation that has been observed in humans between the methylation status of certain DNA loci and chronological age. While genome-wide methylation sequencing has been the most prominent approach in epigenetics research, recent studies have shown that targeted sequencing of a limited number of loci can be successfully used for the estimation of chronological age from DNA samples, even when using small datasets. Following this shift, the need to investigate further into the appropriate statistics behind the predictive models used for DNA methylation-based prediction has been identified in multiple studies. This chapter will look into an example of basic data manipulation and modeling that can be applied to small DNA methylation datasets (100-400 samples) produced through targeted methylation sequencing for a small number of predictors (10-25 methylation sites). Data manipulation will focus on converting the obtained methylation values for the different predictors to a statistically meaningful dataset, followed by a basic introduction into importing such datasets in R, as well as randomizing and splitting into appropriate training and test sets for modeling. Finally, a basic introduction to R modeling will be outlined, starting with feature selection algorithms and continuing with a simple modeling example (linear model) as well as a more complex algorithm (Support Vector Machine).",-1
The Protein L-Isoaspartyl (D-Aspartyl) Methyltransferase Regulates Glial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and Migration Induced by TGF-Î²1 in Human U-87 MG Glioma Cells,"The enzyme PIMT methylates abnormal aspartyl residues in proteins. U-87 MG cells are commonly used to study the most frequent brain tumor, glioblastoma. Previously, we reported that PIMT isoform I possessed oncogenic features when overexpressed in U-87 MG and U-251 MG glioma cells. Higher levels of wild-type PIMT stimulated migration and invasion in both glioma cell lines. Conversely, PIMT silencing reduced these migratory abilities of both cell lines. These results indicate that PIMT could play a critical role in glioblastoma growth. Here, we investigated for the first time, molecular mechanisms involving PIMT in the regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) upon TGF-Î²1 treatments. Gene array analyses indicated that EMT genes but not PIMT gene were regulated in U-87 MG cells treated with TGF-Î²1. Importantly, PIMT silencing by siRNA inhibited in vitro migration in U-87 MG cells induced by TGF-Î²1. In contrast, overexpressed wild-type PIMT and TGF-Î²1 had additive effects on cell migration. When PIMT was inhibited by siRNA, this prevented Slug induction by TGF-Î²1, while Snail stimulation by TGF-Î²1 was increased. Indeed, overexpression of wild-type PIMT led to the opposite effects on Slug and Snail expression dependent on TGF-Î²1. These data highlighted the importance of PIMT in the EMT response dependent on TGF-Î²1 in U-87 MG glioma cells by an antagonist regulation in the expression of transcription factors Slug and Snail, which are critical players in EMT.",-1
Identification and Characterization of Circular RNAs in Mammary Tissue from Holstein Cows at Early Lactation and Non-Lactation,"In this study, circular RNAs (circRNAs) from Holstein cow mammary tissues were identified and compared between early lactation and non-lactation. After analysis, 10,684 circRNAs were identified, ranging from 48 to 99,406 bp, and the average size was 882 bp. The circRNAs were mainly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 11, and 89.89% of the circRNAs belonged to sense-overlapping circRNA. The exons contained with circRNAs ranged from 1 to 47 and were concentrated from 1 to 5. Compared with the non-lactating cows, 87 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the peak lactation cows. There were 68 upregulated circRNAs and 19 downregulated circRNAs. Enrichment analysis of circRNAs showed that GO analysis mainly focused on immune response, triglyceride transport, T cell receptor signaling pathway, etc. Pathway analysis mainly focused on cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, T helper 17 cell differentiation, fatty acid biosynthesis, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, etc. Specific primers were designed for two proximal ends of the circRNA junction sites to allow for PCR validation of four randomly selected circRNAs and carry out circRNA-miRNA interaction research. This study revealed the expression profile and characteristics of circRNAs in mammary tissue from Holstein cows at early lactation and non-lactation, thus providing rich information for the study of circRNA functions and mechanisms, as well as potential candidate miRNA genes for studying lactation in Holstein cows.",-1
Bisphenol A exposure triggers the malignant transformation of prostatic hyperplasia in beagle dogs via cfa-miR-204/KRAS axis,"The prostatic toxicity of bisphenol A (BPA) exposure is mainly associated with hormonal disturbances, thus interfering with multiple signal pathways and increasing the susceptibility to prostatic lesions. This study concentrates predominantly on the potential effect and mechanisms of low-dose BPA exposure on prostates in adult beagle dogs. The dogs were orally given BPA (2, 6, 18 Î¼g/kg/day) and vehicle for 8 weeks, followed by blood collection and dissection. The ascended organ coefficient and volume of prostates, thickened epithelium, as well as histopathological observation have manifested that BPA exposure could trigger the aberrant prostatic hyperplasia in beagle dogs. Hormone level detection revealed that the ratios of estradiol (E2) to testosterone (T) (E2/T) and prolactin (PRL) to T (PRL/T) were up-regulated in the serum from BPA group. Based on microRNA (miRNA) microarray screening and functional enrichment analysis, BPA might facilitate the progression of prostate tumorigenesis in beagle dogs via cfa-miR-204 and its downstream target KRAS oncogene. Subsequently, the overexpression of KRAS, CDKN1A, MAPK1, VEGFA, BCL2 and PTGS2 was validated. These findings provide a series of underlying targets for preventing the initiation and metastasis of BPA-induced prostatic hyperplasia and tumorigenesis, while the regulatory relationship headed with KRAS requires further investigation.",-1
"microRNA-181a-5p impedes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of retinoblastoma cells by targeting the NRAS proto-oncogene","Objectives:                    Accumulating research have reported that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in Retinoblastoma (RB). Nonetheless, the function and underlying mechanism of miR-181a-5p in RB remain ambiguous.              Methods:                    The relative expression levels of miR-181a-5p and NRAS mRNA were detected by quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). RB cell proliferation was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5'-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays. Transwell assays and flow cytometry were performed to detect the migration, invasion, and apoptosis of RB cells. The interaction between miR-181a-5p and NRAS was explored using luciferase experiments, western blotting, and qRT-PCR.              Results:                    miR-181a-5p expression was found to be decreased in RB tissues and cell lines, and its expression was correlated with unfavorable pathological features of the patients. In vitro experiments revealed that miR-181a-5p reduced RB cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while enhancing apoptosis. Further research confirmed that NRAS is a direct target of miR-181a-5p. miR-181a-5p inhibited NRAS expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Co-transfection of pcDNA-NRAS or NRAS small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the effects of miR-181a-5p mimics or miR-181a-5p inhibitors on RB cells.              Conclusion:                    miR-181a-5p was significantly downregulated during the development of RB, and it suppressed the malignant behaviors of RB cells by targeting NRAS.",-1
Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Inflammation on Selected Organ Systems of the Human Body,"Introduction and purpose of the study:                    SARS-CoV-2 virus does not only affect the respiratory system. It may cause damage to many organ systems with long-term effects. The latest scientific reports inform that this virus leaves a long-term trace in the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, urinary and reproductive systems. It manifests itself in disturbances in the functioning of the organs of these systems, causing serious health problems. The aim of the study was to review the latest research into the long-term effects of COVID-19 and determine how common these symptoms are and who is most at risk. Based on a literature review using the electronic scientific databases of PubMed and Web of Science on the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 88 studies were included in the analysis. The information contained in the analyzed literature shows that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause multi-organ damage, causing a number of long-term negative health complications.              Conclusions:                    There is evidence that the virus can cause long-term complications lasting more than six months. They mainly concern disturbances in the functioning of the nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems. However, these studies are small or short-lasting, and many are speculative.",-1
[A heart sound classification method based on complete ensemble empirical modal decomposition with adaptive noise permutation entropy and support vector machine],"Heart sound signal is a kind of physiological signal with nonlinear and nonstationary features. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the phonocardiogram (PCG) classification, a new method was proposed by means of support vector machine (SVM) in which the complete ensemble empirical modal decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) permutation entropy was as the eigenvector of heart sound signal. Firstly, the PCG was decomposed by CEEMDAN into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from high to low frequency. Secondly, the IMFs were sifted according to the correlation coefficient, energy factor and signal-to-noise ratio. Then the instantaneous frequency was extracted by Hilbert transform, and its permutation entropy was constituted into eigenvector. Finally, the accuracy of the method was verified by using a hundred PCG samples selected from the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge. The results showed that the accuracy rate of the proposed method could reach up to 87%. In comparison with the traditional EMD and EEMD permutation entropy methods, the accuracy rate was increased by 18%-24%, which demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method.",-1
"Simultaneous circulation of two West Nile virus lineage 2 clades and Bagaza virus in the Zambezi region, Namibia","Flaviviruses include a great diversity of mosquito-borne arboviruses with epidemic potential and high global disease burden. Several flaviviruses are circulating in southern Africa affecting humans and livestock, among them West Nile virus (WNV) and Wesselsbron virus. Despite their high relevance, no arbovirus surveillance study has been conducted for more than 35 years in Namibia. In this study we assessed the diversity of flaviviruses circulating in mosquitoes in the densely populated, semi-tropical Zambezi region of north-eastern Namibia. In total, 10,206 mosquitoes were sampled in Bwabwata and Mudumu national parks and Mashi and Wuparo conservancies and screened for flavivirus infections. A high infection rate with insect-specific flaviviruses was found with 241 strains of two previously known and seven putative novel insect-specific flaviviruses. In addition, we identified ten strains of WNV in the main vector Cx. univittatus sampled in the Mashi conservancy. Surprisingly, the strains fell into two different clades of lineage 2, 2b and 2d. Further, three strains of Bagaza Virus (BAGV) were found in Cx. univittatus mosquitoes originating from Mudumu national park. Assessment of BAGV growth in different cell lines showed high replication rates in mosquito and duck cells and about 100,000fold lower replication in human, primate and rodent cells. We demonstrate a wide genetic diversity of flaviviruses is circulating in mosquitoes in the Zambezi region. Importantly, WNV and BAGV can cause outbreaks including severe disease and mortality in humans and birds, respectively. Future studies should focus on WNV and BAGV geographic distribution, as well as on their potential health impacts in and the associated social and economic implications for southern Africa.",-1
Integrated analysis of the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA expression profiles reveals novel insights into potential mechanisms in response to root-knot nematodes in peanut,"Background:                    Peanut is the most essential oil and food crop globally due to its high oil and protein content. Root-knot nematode infects peanut roots, causing poor development and severely limiting peanut yields worldwide. The discovery of peanut genome identified a considerable number of genetic loci controlling the peanut root-knot nematode; however, the molecular mechanism of root-knot nematode remains unknown.              Results:                    The heterogeneous response to root-knot nematode stress in peanut roots was identified using whole-transcriptome RNA-seq. A total of 430 mRNAs, 111 miRNAs, 4453 lncRNAs, and 123 circRNAs were found to have differential expression between infected and non-infected peanuts. The expression profiles of the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were developed to understand the potential pathways that lead to root-knot nematodes in peanut roots. During root-knot nematodes stress, a total of 10 lncRNAs, 4 circRNAs, 5 miRNAs, and 13 mRNAs can create competing endogenous RNA and participate in the oxidation-reduction process as well as other biological metabolism processes in peanuts. The findings will highlight the role of peanut ceRNAs in response to root-knot nematodes.              Conclusion:                    The GO classification and KEGG pathway enrichment study of core regulatory networks revealed that ceRNAs are involved in oxidation-reduction, peroxidase activity, lignin synthesis in the xylem, and flavonoid synthesis. Overall, these findings may help researchers better understand the role of non-coding RNAs in response to root-knot nematodes.",-1
Sequential Biotherapy Targeting IL-5 and IL-4/13 in Patients with Eosinophilic Asthma with Sinusitis and Otitis Media,"Type 2 (T2) inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases such as asthma, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), or eosinophilic otitis media (EOM). Currently, in severe asthma with the T2 phenotype, biologics targeting mediators of T2 inflammation dramatically improve the management of severe asthma. While treatment with a single biologic is common, little is known about cases of the sequential use of two biologics. Here, we report a case of severe asthma with refractory ECRS and EOM in which total control of these allergic diseases could not be achieved with a single biologic but could be achieved via the sequential use of the anti-IL-5 receptor antibody and human anti-IL-4/13 receptor monoclonal antibody. It is suggested that it is necessary to control multiple T2 inflammatory pathways to achieve total control of severe allergic diseases. Sequential biotherapy may help solve the clinical challenges associated with single-agent molecular-targeted therapies.",-1
Elevated fasting blood glucose is predictive of the severity and poor outcome in nondiabetic patients with cerebral venous thrombosis,"Background and purpose:                    Although elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) at admission is associated with poor outcome in patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, it has not been investigated in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We aimed to determine the correlation between elevated FBG and severity and outcome among CVT patients.              Methods:                    Consecutive CVT patients between 2009 and 2019 were identified for this retrospective study. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or incomplete clinical data were excluded. Hyperglycemia was defined as FBG â?6.1 mmol/L, further classified as mild (6.1-6.9 mmol/L) and severe hyperglycemia (â?.0 mmol/L). The severity of CVT was assessed at admission using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), CVT-related complications, and intracranial pressure. The outcome was assessed at discharge using mRS; mRS 3-6 indicated poor outcome.              Results:                    Of 160 patients, 36 (22.5%) had hyperglycemia, and 24 (15%) had severe hyperglycemia. Baseline FBG positively correlated with NIHSS at admission (r = 0.55, P < .001). Patients with hyperglycemia had higher baseline mRS scores (P < .001), higher incidence of cerebral venous infarction (P = .039), intracranial hemorrhage (P = .005), coma (P < .001), and seizure (P = .010). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients with hyperglycemia had a higher risk of poor outcome (adjusted OR: 4.47; 95% CI: 1.05-18.95), and subgroup analysis showed that severe hyperglycemia (adjusted OR: 6.66; 95% CI: 1.35-32.81) was a stronger independent predictor of poor outcome.              Conclusions:                    Admission FBG was associated with severity of CVT, and elevated FBG is a predictor of short-term poor outcome among CVT patients.",-1
Proliferatins suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation via inhibition of the NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways,"Three previously undescribed polyketides [proliferatin A-C (1-3)] with anti-inflammatory activity were isolated from Fusarium proliferatum. 1-3 attenuated the production of inflammatory signal messengers including nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species, proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), as well as the related proteins nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. Transcriptome analyses based on RNA-seq indicated the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism of 1-3 involved in the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways. Experimental evaluation of the protein levels revealed that 1-3 can inhibit the phosphorylation of IÎºB kinase (IKK), the degradation of NF-ÎºB Inhibitor-Î± (IÎºBÎ±), the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and can reduce NF-ÎºB transportation to the nucleus. Interestingly, 1-3 decreased the phosphorylation of MAPKs including p-p38, p-ERK, and p-JNK. Molecular docking models suggest that binding of 1-3 to TLR4-MD-2 complex may lead to inhibition of NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways, which was confirmed in vitro by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. 1-3 can thus constitute potential therapeutic candidates for the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases.",-1
An Augmented Model with Inferred Blood Features for the Self-diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome,"Background and objectives:                    The penetration rate of physical examinations in China is substantially lower than that in developed countries. Therefore, an auxiliary approach that does not depend on hospital health checks for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is needed.              Methods:                    In this study, we proposed an augmented method with inferred blood features that uses self-care inputs available at home for the auxiliary diagnosis of MetS. The dataset used for modeling contained data on 91,420 individuals who had at least 2 consecutive years of health checks. We trained three separate models using a regularized gradient-boosted decision tree. The first model used only home-based features; additional blood test data (including triglyceride [TG] data, fasting blood glucose data, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] data) were included in the second model. However, in the augmented approach, the blood test data were manipulated using multivariate imputation by chained equations prior to inclusion in the third model. The performance of the three models for MetS auxiliary diagnosis was then quantitatively compared.              Results:                    The results showed that the third model exhibited the highest classification accuracy for MetS in comparison with the other two models (area under the curve [AUC]: 3rd vs. 2nd vs. 1st = 0.971 vs. 0.950 vs. 0.905, p < 0.001). We further revealed that with full sets of the three measurements from earlier blood test data, the classification accuracy of MetS can be further improved (AUC: without vs. with = 0.971 vs. 0.993). However, the magnitude of improvement was not statistically significant at the 1% level of significance (p = 0.014).              Conclusion:                    Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of the third model for MetS homecare applications and lend novel insights into innovative research on the health management of MetS. Further validation and implementation of our proposed model might improve quality of life and ultimately benefit the general population.",-1
The Development of the Social Functioning Scale for Patients with Parkinson's Disease,"Background:                    Social functioning is crucial for the determinants of Parkinson's disease (PD) with dementia; however, there is no social functioning scale applicable to PD.              Objective:                    This study aimed to develop a social functioning scale specific to PD (PDSFS) and provide a cut-off score to improve diagnosis accuracy.              Methods:                    The items were developed through literature, interview patients, and PD expertise. After the pilot study, one hundred fifty-seven patients and 74 healthy participants were enrolled and completed the Mini-Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test, Activities of Daily Living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition (ABAS-II) and part III of the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).              Results:                    The final PDSFS has 23 items. The exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors, including ""Family Life, Hobbies and Self-Care"", ""Interpersonal Relationship and Recreational Leisure"", and ""Social Bond"". The internal consistency coefficient was 0.883, and the test-retest reliability was 0.774, respectively. The total score of the PDSFS was significantly related to the total score of ABAS-II (r = 0.609, p < 0.001), and was not correlated with the third part of MDS-UPDRS (p = 0.736). A significant intergroup difference was found (p < 0.001), and the healthy controls had the highest PDSFS score, followed by non-demented PD and PD dementia. The optimal cut-off score for PD patients with dementia was 39 (sensitivity: 0.735; specificity: 0.857).              Conclusions:                    PDSFS is a practical and psychometrically sound tool to access the social functioning of the PD population.",-1
High Visceral Adipose Tissue to Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Ratio as a Predictor of Mortality in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Background:                    We aimed to further determine the relationship between the areas of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and the ratio of VAT to SAT (VAT/SAT) with the outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients.              Methods:                    A retrospective study was performed on patients with ARDS in 7 intensive care units (ICU) of West China Hospital, Sichuan University.              Results:                    A total of 169 patients were included in the analysis. Abdominal computed tomography scans of each patient within 24 hours of being admitted to the ICU were assessed by at least 2 investigators. Higher VAT/SAT was related with higher hospital mortality (22% vs. 44%, P = 0.003; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.699, 95% CI 0.530-0.922 ([P = 0.011]). On the contrary, higher SAT and VAT were related to lower hospital mortality in ARDS (aOR 1.077, 95% CI 1.037-1.119 [P < 0.001]; aOR 1.017, 95% CI 1.004-1.030 [P = 0.011], respectively). Patients with higher SAT and VAT had shorter length of ICU stay (ICU LOS) (26.26 vs. 15.83 days, P = 0.031; 25.16 vs. 14.19 days, P = 0.007, respectively), while VAT/SAT was not related with ICU LOS. Moreover, we did not find any significant relationship either between VAT/SAT and mechanical ventilation-free days or between SAT and mechanical ventilation-free days.              Conclusions:                    This study suggests that VAT/SAT can contribute to adverse outcomes of patients with ARDS. However, higher SAT and VAT were related to better prognosis of ARDS patients.",-1
"The Association between Dyslipidemia, Dietary Habits and Other Lifestyle Indicators among Non-Diabetic Attendees of Primary Health Care Centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Diet and other lifestyle habits have been reported to contribute to the development of dyslipidemia in various populations. Therefore, this study investigated the association between dyslipidemia and dietary and other lifestyle practices among Saudi adults. Data were collected from adults (â?0 years) not previously diagnosed with diabetes in a cross-sectional design. Demographic, anthropometric, and clinical characteristics, as well as lifestyle and dietary habits were recorded using a predesigned questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were drawn to estimate the serum lipid profile. Out of 1385 people, 858 (62%) (491 men, 367 women) had dyslipidemia. After regression analysis to adjust for age, body mass index, and waist circumference, an intake of â? cups/week of Turkish coffee, or carbonated drinks was associated with increased risk of dyslipidemia in men (OR (95% CI), 2.74 (1.53, 4.89) p = 0.001, and 1.53 (1.04, 2.26) p = 0.03 respectively), while the same intake of American coffee had a protective effect (0.53 (0.30, 0.92) p = 0.025). Sleep duration <6 h, and smoking were also associated with increased risk in men (1.573 (1.14, 2.18) p = 0.006, and 1.41 (1.00, 1.99) p = 0.043 respectively). In women, an increased intake of fresh vegetables was associated with increased risk (2.07 (1.09, 3.94) p = 0.026), which could be attributed to added salad dressing. Thus, there are sex differences in response to dietary and lifestyle practices.",-1
Molecular Targets of Brown Algae Phlorotannins for the Therapy of Inflammatory Processes of Various Origins,"Inflammatory reactions are part of a complex biological response that plays a vital role in the appearance of various stimuli resulting from tissue and cell damage, the invasion of pathogenic bacteria, and the formation of the subsequent adaptive immune response. The production of many triggers and mediators of inflammation, which are inducers of pro-inflammatory factors, is controlled by numerous differentiation programs, through which inflammation is resolved and tissue homeostasis is restored. However, prolonged inflammatory responses or dysregulation of pro-inflammatory mechanisms can lead to chronic inflammation. Modern advances in biotechnology have made it possible to characterize the anti-inflammatory activity of phlorotannins, polyphenolic compounds from brown seaweed, and the mechanisms by which they modulate the inflammatory response. The purpose of this review is to analyze and summarize the results of numerous experimental in vitro and in vivo studies, illustrating the regulatory mechanisms of these compounds, which have a wide range of biological effects on the body. The results of these studies and the need for further research are discussed.",-1
Persistence of Ambigrammatic Narnaviruses Requires Translation of the Reverse Open Reading Frame,"Narnaviruses are RNA viruses detected in diverse fungi, plants, protists, arthropods, and nematodes. Though initially described as simple single-gene nonsegmented viruses encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a subset of narnaviruses referred to as ""ambigrammatic"" harbor a unique genomic configuration consisting of overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoded on opposite strands. Phylogenetic analysis supports selection to maintain this unusual genome organization, but functional investigations are lacking. Here, we establish the mosquito-infecting Culex narnavirus 1 (CxNV1) as a model to investigate the functional role of overlapping ORFs in narnavirus replication. In CxNV1, a reverse ORF without homology to known proteins covers nearly the entire 3.2-kb segment encoding the RdRp. Additionally, two opposing and nearly completely overlapping novel ORFs are found on the second putative CxNV1 segment, the 0.8-kb ""Robin"" RNA. We developed a system to launch CxNV1 in a naive mosquito cell line and then showed that functional RdRp is required for persistence of both segments, and an intact reverse ORF is required on the RdRp segment for persistence. Mass spectrometry of persistently CxNV1-infected cells provided evidence for translation of this reverse ORF. Finally, ribosome profiling yielded a striking pattern of footprints for all four CxNV1 RNA strands that was distinct from actively translating ribosomes on host mRNA or coinfecting RNA viruses. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that the process of translation itself is important for persistence of ambigrammatic narnaviruses, potentially by protecting viral RNA with ribosomes, thus suggesting a heretofore undescribed viral tactic for replication and transmission. IMPORTANCE Fundamental to our understanding of RNA viruses is a description of which strand(s) of RNA are transmitted as the viral genome relative to which encode the viral proteins. Ambigrammatic narnaviruses break the mold. These viruses, found broadly in fungi, plants, and insects, have the unique feature of two overlapping genes encoded on opposite strands, comprising nearly the full length of the viral genome. Such extensive overlap is not seen in other RNA viruses and comes at the cost of reduced evolutionary flexibility in the sequence. The present study is motivated by investigating the benefits which balance that cost. We show for the first time a functional requirement for the ambigrammatic genome configuration in Culex narnavirus 1, which suggests a model for how translation of both strands might benefit this virus. Our work highlights a new blueprint for viral persistence, distinct from strategies defined by canonical definitions of the coding strand.",-1
An Integrated Bioinformatics and Functional Approach for miRNA Validation,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (20-24 nucleotides) non-coding ribo-regulatory molecules with significant roles in regulating target mRNA and long non-coding RNAs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Rapid advancement in the small RNA sequencing methods with integration of degradome sequencing has accelerated the understanding of miRNA-mediated regulatory hubs in plants and yielded extensive annotation of miRNAs and corresponding targets. However, it is becoming clear that large numbers of such annotations are questionable. Therefore, it is imperative to adopt reliable and strict bioinformatics pipelines for miRNA identification. Furthermore, sensitive methods are needed for validation and functional characterization of miRNA and its target(s). In this chapter, we have provided a comprehensive and streamlined methodology for miRNA identification and its functional validation in plants. This includes a combination of various in silico and experimental methodologies. To identify miRNA compendium from large-scale Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) small RNA datasets, the miR-PREFeR (miRNA PREdiction From small RNA-Seq data) bioinformatics tool has been described. Also, a homology-based search protocol for finding members of a specific miRNA family has been discussed. The chapter also includes techniques to ascertain miRNA:target pair specificity using in silico target prediction from degradome NGS libraries using CleaveLand pipeline, miRNA:target validation by in planta transient assays, 5' RLM-RACE and expression analysis as well as functional techniques like miRNA overexpression, short tandem target mimic and resistant target approaches. The proposed strategy offers a reliable and sensitive way for miRNA:target identification and validation. Additionally, we strongly promulgate the use of multiple methodologies to validate a miRNA as well as its target.",-1
[A journey towards precision medicine in type 1 diabetes mellitus],"Diabetes is a group of highly heterogenous diseases with multiple etiopathologies and clinical characteristics. In type 1 diabetes mellitus, there are different endotypes and clinical phenotypes based on genetics, immunology, metabolism and therapeutics.

The article summarizes the concepts, progress and future directions of precision medicine for the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, prognosis, and monitoring of diabetes.",-1
Î±-synuclein suppresses microglial autophagy and promotes neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease,"The cell-to-cell transfer of Î±-synuclein (Î±-Syn) greatly contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis and underlies the spread of Î±-Syn pathology. During this process, extracellular Î±-Syn can activate microglia and neuroinflammation, which plays an important role in PD. However, the effect of extracellular Î±-Syn on microglia autophagy is poorly understood. In the present study, we reported that extracellular Î±-Syn inhibited the autophagy initiation, as indicated by LC3-II reduction and p62 protein elevation in BV2 and cultured primary microglia. The in vitro findings were verified in microglia-enriched population isolated from Î±-Syn-overexpressing mice induced by adeno-associated virus (AAV2/9)-encoded wildtype human Î±-Syn injection into the substantia nigra (SN). Mechanistically, Î±-Syn led to microglial autophagic impairment through activating toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) and its downstream p38 and Akt-mTOR signaling because Tlr4 knockout and inhibition of p38, Akt as well as mTOR prevented Î±-Syn-induced autophagy inhibition. Moreover, inhibition of Akt reversed the mTOR activation but failed to affect p38 phosphorylation triggered by Î±-Syn. Functionally, the in vivo evidence showed that lysozyme 2 Cre (Lyz2cre )-mediated depletion of autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) in microglia aggravated the neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuron losses in the SN and exacerbated the locomotor deficit in Î±-Syn-overexpressing mice. Taken together, the results suggest that extracellular Î±-Syn, via Tlr4-dependent p38 and Akt-mTOR signaling cascades, disrupts microglial autophagy activity which synergistically contributes to neuroinflammation and PD development.",-1
Polymorphism of Alpha-Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils Depends on Ionic Strength and Protein Concentration,"Protein aggregate formation is linked with multiple amyloidoses, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Currently, the understanding of such fibrillar structure formation and propagation is still not sufficient, the outcome of which is a lack of potent, anti-amyloid drugs. The environmental conditions used during in vitro protein aggregation assays play an important role in determining both the aggregation kinetic parameters, as well as resulting fibril structure. In the case of alpha-synuclein, ionic strength has been shown as a crucial factor in its amyloid aggregation. In this work, we examine a large sample size of alpha-synuclein aggregation reactions under thirty different ionic strength and protein concentration combinations and determine the resulting fibril structural variations using their dye-binding properties, secondary structure and morphology. We show that both ionic strength and protein concentration determine the structural variability of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils and that sometimes even identical conditions can result in up to four distinct types of aggregates.",-1
Aortic Fibrosis in Insulin-Sensitive Mice with Endothelial Cell-Specific Deletion of Ceacam1 Gene,"(1) Background: Mice with global Ceacam1 deletion developed plaque-like aortic lesions even on C57BL/6J background in the presence of increased endothelial cell permeability and insulin resistance. Loss of endothelial Ceacam1 gene caused endothelial dysfunction and reduced vascular integrity without affecting systemic insulin sensitivity. Because endothelial cell injury precedes atherosclerosis, we herein investigated whether the loss of endothelial Ceacam1 initiates atheroma formation in the absence of insulin resistance. (2) Methods: Endothelial cell-specific Ceacam1 null mice on C57BL/6J.Ldlr-/- background (Ldlr-/-VECadCre+Cc1fl/fl) were fed an atherogenic diet for 3-5 months before metabolic, histopathological, and en-face analysis of aortae were compared to their control littermates. Sirius Red stain was also performed on liver sections to analyze hepatic fibrosis. (3) Results: These mice displayed insulin sensitivity without significant fat deposition on aortic walls despite hypercholesterolemia. They also displayed increased inflammation and fibrosis. Deleting Ceacam1 in endothelial cells caused hyperactivation of VEGFR2/Shc/NF-ÎºB pathway with resultant transcriptional induction of NF-ÎºB targets. These include IL-6 that activates STAT3 inflammatory pathways, in addition to endothelin-1 and PDGF-B profibrogenic effectors. It also induced the association between SHP2 phosphatase and VEGFR2, downregulating the Akt/eNOS pathway and reducing nitric oxide production, a characteristic feature of endothelial dysfunction. Similarly, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis developed in Ldlr-/-VECadCre+Cc1fl/fl mice without an increase in hepatic steatosis. (4) Conclusions: Deleting endothelial cell Ceacam1 caused hepatic and aortic inflammation and fibrosis with increased endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the presence of hypercholesterolemia. However, this did not progress into frank atheroma formation. Because these mice remained insulin sensitive, the study provides an in vivo demonstration that insulin resistance plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of frank atherosclerosis.",-1
"Toward targeted prevention: risk factors for prediabetes defined by impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and increased HbA1c in the population-based KORA study from Germany","Aims:                    To identify socioeconomic, behavioral and clinical factors that are associated with prediabetes according to different prediabetes definition criteria.              Methods:                    Analyses use pooled data of the population-based Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) studies (n = 5312 observations aged â?38 years without diabetes). Prediabetes was defined through either impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or elevated HbA1c according to thresholds of the American Diabetes Association. Explanatory variables were regressed on prediabetes using generalized estimating equations.              Results:                    Mean age was 58.4 years; 50% had prediabetes (33% had IFG, 16% IGT, and 26% elevated HbA1c, 10% fulfilled all three criteria). Age, obesity, hypertension, low education, unemployment, statutory health insurance, urban residence and physical inactivity were associated with prediabetes. Male sex was a stronger risk factor for IFG (OR = 2.5; 95%-CI: 2.2-2.9) than for IGT or elevated HbA1c, and being unemployed was a stronger risk factor for IGT (OR = 3.2 95%-CI: 2.6-4.0) than for IFG or elevated HbA1c.              Conclusions:                    The overlap of people with IFG, IGT and elevated HbA1c is small, and some factors are associated with only one criterion. Knowledge on sociodemographic and socioeconomic risk factors can be used to effectively target interventions to people at high risk for type 2 diabetes.",-1
Revitalising sensualities of ageing with Parkinson's through dance,"Dance for Parkinson's can be characterised as a growing social movement which has become a worldwide phenomenon that gives rise to new questions about the meaning and importance of dance in relation to intersecting and overlapping identity categories of ageing and chronic conditions. In this article, we probe into the potentially constructive interplay between the lived experiences of Parkinson's dance as a space of revitalised sensuality and the cultural imaginations and values connected to the nexus between ageing and chronic conditions. Through a dialogic interpretive framework that recognises and ascribes value to the embodied experiences of Parkinson's dancers, we analyse how the experiences of living with Parkinson's as a chronic condition in the context of ageing are in interplay with the experiences of dancing as an embodied sensual activity. Consequently, we propose that, by emphasising the critical value of stories told by Parkinson's dancers, we are able to gain a more nuanced understanding of how Parkinson's dance affects the nexus between ageing and chronic conditions in revitalising and sensual ways.",-1
Lies and Irony Understanding in Deaf and Hearing Adolescents,"Lies and irony are paradigmatic examples of nonliteral communication; many deaf children and even adults have difficulty in understanding them. The present study assessed the understanding of lies and irony in 96 adolescents living in Spain in urban settings (58 deaf participants, 38 hearing participants; 10-19 years old). We investigated whether deaf and hearing participants differ in their performance, and the effects of age, theory of mind (ToM), and language on the understanding of these nonliteral meanings in deaf participants. The results show that deaf participants do not find it difficult to detect nonliteral statements, but they experience difficulty in attributing the real motivation to the speaker. ToM and language explained performance in the understanding of nonliteral communication in the deaf group. The results suggest the need to focus on promoting the ability to attribute real motivations to speakers. We propose an assessment sequence that differs from those used in other studies. In the proposed sequence, ToM skills would be combined with other skills that influence the understanding of lies and irony and would be sequenced according to the observed performance in deaf adolescents.",-1
"Costunolide protects against alcohol-induced liver injury by regulating gut microbiota, oxidative stress and attenuating inflammation in vivo and in vitro","Costunolide (cos) derived from the roots of Dolomiaea souliei (Franch.), which belongs to the Dolomiaea genus in the family Compositae, exert the anti-inebriation effect mainly by inhibiting the absorption of alcohol in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the protective effect of cos against alcohol-induced liver injury (ALI) remains obscure. The present study was aimed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of cos (silymarin was used as positive control) against ALI and its potential mechanisms. MTT was used to examine the effect of cos on the cell viability of L-02 cells. Plasma was separated from blood that used to test the levels of TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-12, and LPS while serum separated from blood which used to detect the level of ALT and AST. Liver tissues were obtained for histopathological examination and western blot analysis. Fresh mice feces samples were collected for the detection of bacterial composition. Cos exhibited protective effect against alcoholic-induced liver injury by regulating gut microbiota capacities (higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria while lower in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria), adjusting oxidative stress (reduced the activities of MDA and ROS while promoted SOD, GSH and GSH-PX in L-02 cells) and attenuating inflammation (decreased the levels of ALT, AST, LPS, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-Î±) via LPS-TLR4-NF-ÎºB p65 signaling pathway, which might be an active therapeutic agent for treatment of ALI.",-1
Relationship between inflammatory markers and visceral obesity in obese and overweight Korean adults: An observational study,"Obesity is now considered a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. We investigated the relationship between several inflammatory markers and body composition for identifying patients with an increased risk of visceral obesity and compared the predictive values of inflammatory indices in visceral obesity.Six hundred individuals who received health checkups for obesity-related risk factors in Severance Hospital between January 2008 and March 2017 were included in our study. Serum inflammatory markers, such as white blood cell (WBC), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) levels were assessed. Intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured with computed tomography. We performed analysis of covariance, trend analysis, Steiger's Z tests, and multiple linear regression analysis to investigate associations between abdominal adiposity indices and inflammatory markers.Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a stronger association of VAT with WBC counts (r = 0.157, P < .001) than with levels of NLR (r = 0.108, P = .11; Steiger's Z test, P = .04) and PLR (r = 0.036, P = .39; Steiger's Z test, P = .003). WBC and hsCRP levels linearly increased with VAT area (overall P < .001 and trend P < .001) and VAT/SAT ratio (overall P = .001 and trend P = .002; overall P < .001 and trend P < .001, respectively) but linearly decreased with SAT (overall P = .02 and trend P = .17; overall P = .03 and trend P = .01, respectively). Visceral adipose tissue area was more highly associated with WBC and hsCRP levels than with NLR and PLR. Only VAT area was significantly associated with WBC, hsCRP, and NLR levels after adjusting for confounding variables.We found that VAT, but not SAT area is independently associated with several inflammatory markers. WBC and hsCRP are more strongly correlated with VAT compared with NLR and PLR. Thus, WBC and hsCRP could be useful parameters for identifying individuals at risk for visceral obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.",-1
Urolithin A attenuates arsenic-induced gut barrier dysfunction,"Environmental chemicals such as inorganic arsenic (iAs) significantly contribute to redox toxicity in the human body by enhancing oxidative stress. Imbalanced oxidative stress rapidly interferes with gut homeostasis and affects variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity. It has been shown that gut microbiota are essential to protect against iAs3+-induced toxicity. However, the effect of microbial metabolites on iAs3+-induced toxicity and loss of gut barrier integrity has not been investigated. The objectives of the study are to investigate impact of iAs on gut barrier function and determine benefits of gut microbial metabolite, urolithin A (UroA) against iAs3+-induced adversaries on gut epithelium. We have utilized both colon epithelial cells and in a human intestinal 3D organoid model system to investigate iAs3+-induced cell toxicity, oxidative stress, and gut barrier dysfunction in the presence or absence of UroA. Here, we report that treatment with UroA attenuated iAs3+-induced cell toxicity, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in colon epithelial cells. Moreover, our data suggest that UroA significantly reduces iAs3+-induced gut barrier permeability and inflammatory markers in both colon epithelial cells and in a human intestinal 3D organoid model system. Mechanistically, UroA protected against iAs3+-induced disruption of tight junctional proteins in intestinal epithelial cells through blockade of oxidative stress and markers of inflammation. Taken together, our studies for the first time suggest that microbial metabolites such as UroA can potentially be used to protect against environmental hazards by reducing intestinal oxidative stress and by enhancing gut barrier function.",-1
Anthropometer3D: Automatic Multi-Slice Segmentation Software for the Measurement of Anthropometric Parameters from CT of PET/CT,"Anthropometric parameters like muscle body mass (MBM), fat body mass (FBM), lean body mass (LBM), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) are used in oncology. Our aim was to develop and evaluate the software Anthropometer3D measuring these anthropometric parameters on the CT of PET/CT. This software performs a multi-atlas segmentation of CT of PET/CT with extrapolation coefficients for the body parts beyond the usual acquisition range (from the ischia to the eyes). The multi-atlas database is composed of 30 truncated CTs manually segmented to isolate three types of voxels (muscle, fat, and visceral fat). To evaluate Anthropomer3D, a leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to measure MBM, FBM, LBM, VAT, and SAT. The reference standard was based on the manual segmentation of the corresponding whole-body CT. A manual segmentation of one CT slice at level L3 was also used. Correlations were analyzed using Dice coefficient, intra-class coefficient correlation (ICC), and Bland-Altman plot. The population was heterogeneous (sex ratio 1:1; mean age 57 years old [min 23; max 74]; mean BMI 27 kg/m2 [min 18; max 40]). Dice coefficients between reference standard and Anthropometer3D were excellent (mean+/-SD): muscle 0.95 Â± 0.02, fat 1.00 Â± 0.01, and visceral fat 0.97 Â± 0.02. The ICC was almost perfect (minimal value of 95% CI of 0.97). All Bland-Altman plot values (mean difference, 95% CI and slopes) were better for Anthropometer3D compared to L3 level segmentation. Anthropometer3D allows multiple anthropometric measurements based on an automatic multi-slice segmentation. It is more precise than estimates using L3 level segmentation.",-1
Visceral Adiposity Index as an Independent Marker of Subclinical Atherosclerosis in Individuals Prone to Diabetes Mellitus,"Aim:                    The visceral adiposity index (VAI) has been proposed as an estimate of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and as an indicator of VAT dysfunction. Both parameters are associated with cardiometabolic risk, including insulin resistance. In this study, we investigated whether VAI is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in subjects who were free of cardiovascular disease but were at risk of developing diabetes mellitus.              Methods:                    A total of 731 adults with a median age of 47 years old without diabetes mellitus were included in this cross-sectional study. The anthropometric data, blood pressure, and lipid profiles of 398 women and 333 men were measured. All subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was evaluated by ultrasound. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).              Results:                    VAI and HOMA-IR (Ãst=0.44, pï¼?.0001), VAI and cIMT (Ãst=0.17, pï¼?.0001), and HOMA-IR and cIMT (Ãst=0.09, p=0.0127) were correlated with each other. After adjusting for cofounding variables, VAI is still correlated with HOMA-IR (Ãst=0.42, pï¼?.0001). Furthermore, VAI (Ãst=0.07, p=0.0392) but not HOMA-IR (Ãst=0.03, p=0.37) was correlated with cIMT independently of other established cardiovascular risk factors.              Conclusion:                    The calculation of VAI may provide a better estimation of subclinical atherosclerosis than the calculation of HOMA-IR.",-1
Digging Deeper: Advancements in Visualization of Inhibitory Synapses in Neurodegenerative Disorders,"Recent research has provided strong evidence that neurodegeneration may develop from an imbalance between synaptic structural components in the brain. Lately, inhibitory synapses communicating via the neurotransmitters GABA or glycine have come to the center of attention. Increasing evidence suggests that imbalance in the structural composition of inhibitory synapses affect deeply the ability of neurons to communicate effectively over synaptic connections. Progressive failure of synaptic plasticity and memory are thus hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. In order to prove that structural changes at synapses contribute to neurodegeneration, we need to visualize single-molecule interactions at synaptic sites in an exact spatial and time frame. This visualization has been restricted in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. New developments in electron microscopy and super-resolution microscopy have improved spatial and time resolution tremendously, opening up numerous possibilities. Here we critically review current and recently developed methods for high-resolution visualization of inhibitory synapses in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. We present advantages, strengths, weaknesses, and current limitations for selected methods in research, as well as present a future perspective. A range of new options has become available that will soon help understand the involvement of inhibitory synapses in neurodegenerative disorders.",-1
Expression characteristics and interaction networks of microRNAs in spleen tissues of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella),"The spleen is an important immune organ in fish. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of immune function. However, miRNA expression profiles and their interaction networks associated with the postnatal late development of spleen tissue are still poorly understood in fish. The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is an important economic aquaculture species in China. Here, two small RNA libraries were constructed from the spleen tissue of healthy grass carp at one-year-old and three-year-old. A total of 324 known conserved miRNAs and 9 novel miRNAs were identified by using bioinformatic analysis. Family analysis showed that 23 families such as let-7, mir-1, mir-10, mir-124, mir-8, mir-7, mir-9, and mir-153 were highly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates. In addition, 14 families such as mir-459, mir-430, mir-462, mir-7147, mir-2187, and mir-722 were present only in fish. Expression analysis showed that the expression patterns of miRNAs in the spleen of one-year-old and three-year-old grass carp were highly consistent, and the percentage of miRNAs with TPM > 100 was above 39%. Twenty significant differentially expressed (SDE) miRNAs were identified. Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that these SDE miRNAs were primarily involved in erythrocyte differentiation, lymphoid organ development, immune response, lipid metabolic process, the B cell receptor signaling pathway, the T cell receptor signaling pathway, and the PPAR signaling pathway. In addition, the following miRNA-mRNA interaction networks were constructed: immune and hematopoietic, cell proliferation and differentiation, and lipid metabolism. This study determined the miRNA transcriptome as well as miRNA-mRNA interaction networks in normal spleen tissue during the late development stages of grass carp. The results expand the number of known miRNAs in grass carp and are a valuable resource for better understanding the molecular biology of the spleen development in grass carp.",-1
Use of artificial intelligence in activating the role of Saudi universities in joint scientific research between university teachers and students,"Scientific research in Saudi Arabia's universities has undergone significant changes in recent years with the speed of higher education expansion and the opening of new universities. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to existing data analysis processes to enhance pattern recognition and to support advanced data analysis. This study aimed to investigate the obstacles to activating the role of university instructors and students in joint scientific research. The study also aimed to evaluate joint scientific research between university teachers and students in universities, as well as the mechanisms for activating joint scientific research among male and female students in health and humanities science within Saudi universities, to enhance creation and invention achievements. To determine the obstacles to activating scientific research roles between students and tutors in Saudi universities using AI, a simple random sampling technique was adopted for this study. A well-structured questionnaire was administered to 250 respondents affiliated with universities in Saudi Arabia. The data collected were statistically analyzed with the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. The results of this study revealed that the objectives of joint scientific research between university teachers and students in universities have a significant positive predictor of obstacles to activating the role of teachers in joint scientific research with students in Saudi universities. The study also showed that there was a statistically significant correlation (p value = 0.00) between each of the variables.",-1
Mitochondria-Endoplasmic Reticulum Crosstalk in Parkinson's Disease: The Role of Brain Renin Angiotensin System Components,"The past few decades have seen an increased emphasis on the involvement of the mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) in various neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD, alterations in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and MAM functions affect the secretion and metabolism of proteins, causing an imbalance in calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress. These changes lead to alterations in the translocation of the MAM components, such as IP3R, VDAC, and MFN1 and 2, and consequently disrupt calcium homeostasis and cause misfolded proteins with impaired autophagy, distorted mitochondrial dynamics, and cell death. Various reports indicate the detrimental involvement of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis in various neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we attempted to update the reports (using various search engines, such as PubMed, SCOPUS, Elsevier, and Springer Nature) demonstrating the pathogenic interactions between the various proteins present in mitochondria, ER, and MAM with respect to Parkinson's disease. We also made an attempt to speculate the possible involvement of RAS and its components, i.e., AT1 and AT2 receptors, angiotensinogen, in this crosstalk and PD pathology. The review also collates and provides updated information on the role of MAM in calcium signaling, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis in PD.",-1
A catalogue with semantic annotations makes multilabel datasets FAIR,"Multilabel classification (MLC) is a machine learning task where the goal is to learn to label an example with multiple labels simultaneously. It receives increasing interest from the machine learning community, as evidenced by the increasing number of papers and methods that appear in the literature. Hence, ensuring proper, correct, robust, and trustworthy benchmarking is of utmost importance for the further development of the field. We believe that this can be achieved by adhering to the recently emerged data management standards, such as the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and TRUST (Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability, and Technology) principles. We introduce an ontology-based online catalogue of MLC datasets originating from various application domains following these principles. The catalogue extensively describes many MLC datasets with comprehensible meta-features, MLC-specific semantic descriptions, and different data provenance information. The MLC data catalogue is available at: http://semantichub.ijs.si/MLCdatasets .",-1
Key Characteristics of Residual Malaria Transmission in Two Districts in South-Eastern Tanzania-Implications for Improved Control,"After 2 decades of using insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and improved case management, malaria burden in the historically-holoendemic Kilombero valley in Tanzania has significantly declined. We review key characteristics of the residual transmission and recommend options for improvement. Transmission has declined by >10-fold since 2000 but remains heterogeneous over small distances. Following the crash of Anopheles gambiae, which coincided with ITN scale-up around 2005-2012, Anopheles funestus now dominates malaria transmission. While most infections still occur indoors, substantial biting happens outdoors and before bed-time. There is widespread resistance to pyrethroids and carbamates; An. funestus being particularly strongly-resistant. In short and medium-term, these challenges could be addressed using high-quality indoor residual spraying with nonpyrethroids, or ITNs incorporating synergists. Supplementary tools, eg, spatial-repellents may expand protection outdoors. However, sustainable control requires resilience-building approaches, particularly improved housing and larval-source management to suppress mosquitoes, stronger health systems guaranteeing case-detection and treatment, greater community-engagement and expanded health education.",-1
"Modelling distributions of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus using climate, host density and interspecies competition","Florida faces the challenge of repeated introduction and autochthonous transmission of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Empirically-based predictive models of the spatial distribution of these species would aid surveillance and vector control efforts. To predict the occurrence and abundance of these species, we fit a mixed-effects zero-inflated negative binomial regression to a mosquito surveillance dataset with records from more than 200,000 trap days, representative of 53% of the land area and ranging from 2004 to 2018 in Florida. We found an asymmetrical competitive interaction between adult populations of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus for the sampled sites. Wind speed was negatively associated with the occurrence and abundance of both vectors. Our model predictions show high accuracy (72.9% to 94.5%) in validation tests leaving out a random 10% subset of sites and data since 2017, suggesting a potential for predicting the distribution of the two Aedes vectors.",-1
"MiR-509-3p is oncogenic, targets the tumor suppressor PHLPP2, and functions as a novel tumor adjacent normal tissue based prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer","Background:                    Recently the role of microRNAs has been explored immensely as novel regulators and potential biomarkers in several cancers. MiR-509-3p is one such miRNA that has been observed to show a mixed expression in different cancers, while it's expression and clinical relevance in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been characterized.              Methods:                    We used quantitative PCR to evaluate the expression of miR-509-3p in fresh-frozen CRC tumor tissues and the corresponding tumor-adjacent normal (NAT) tissues from 103 patients. Subsequently, functional studies were performed to further interpret the role of the miRNA in CRC.              Results:                    MiR-509-3p was found to be overexpressed in CRC tissues in nearly 80% of cases and was associated with an aggressive disease presentation. Notably, a higher expression of the miRNA promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells in in vitro and in vivo models. Mechanistically, we confirmed that miR-509-3p directly binds the 3'UTR of the tumor suppressor PHLPP2 and inhibits its expression. Furthermore, within the previous 103 clinical tissue specimens, we observed an overexpression of miR-509-3p within the NAT tissue of patients associated with a poor disease prognosis. Using multivariate analysis, it was observed that the expression of miR-509-3p within the NAT tissue was an independent predictor of prognosis in CRC. At the cellular level, through indirect coculture experiments, miR-509-3p was observed to regulate the proliferative, migratory, and invasive behavior of normal colon cells.              Conclusion:                    MiR-509-3p strongly contributes to the development and progression of CRC and can potentially function as a prognostic biomarker in the disease.",-1
Reversal of severe hypertriglyceridemia with intermittent fasting and a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet: a case series,"Purpose of review:                    To illustrate successful reversal of hypertriglyceridemia using a very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet in conjunction with intermittent fasting in two patients.              Recent findings:                    Hypertriglyceridemia remains an important component of residual risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current guidelines from the AHA/ACC recommend the initiation of a very-low-fat diet to treat persistently elevated triglycerides, whereas the National Lipid Association argues that a very-low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet is contraindicated in severe hypertriglyceridemia. In contrast, we report resolution of two cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia with implementation of very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting.              Summary:                    Here, we describe two patients who have demonstrated substantial reductions in serum triglycerides, effectively reversing severe hypertriglyceridemia using unconventional dietary methods. Although anecdotal, these cases point to a critical lack of flexibility in current dietary guidelines that hinder their application in clinical practice.",-1
MicroRNA-181a Regulates the Proliferation and Differentiation of Hu Sheep Skeletal Muscle Satellite Cells and Targets the YAP1 Gene,"MicroRNA (miRNA) is of great importance to muscle growth and development, including the regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs). In our research group's previous study, we found that miR-181a is differentially expressed in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Hu sheep at different stages. We speculated that miR-181a may participate in the growth and development process of Hu sheep. To understand the mechanism of miR-181a regulating the growth and development of Hu sheep skeletal muscle, we extracted skeletal muscle satellite cells from the longissimus dorsi muscle of 3-month-old Hu sheep fetuses and performed a series of experiments. Our results showed that miR-181a suppressed SMSCs' proliferation using QRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK-8, EDU, and Flow cytometry cycle tests. In addition, QRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence indicated that miR-181a facilitated the differentiation of SMSCs. Then, we used dual-luciferase reporter gene detection, QRT-PCR, and Western blot to find that the Yes1-related transcription regulator (YAP1) is the target gene of miR-181a. Our study supplies a research basis for understanding the regulation mechanism of miR-181a on the growth of Hu sheep skeletal muscle.",-1
Database of Sabethes and Haemagogus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Argentina: Sylvatic Vectors of the Yellow Fever Virus,"Yellow fever is an endemic disease in America caused by an arbovirus that circulates in the sylvatic cycle between nonhuman primates and mosquitoes of the genera Sabethes Robineau-Desvoidy and Haemagogus Williston. The main goal of this work is to report the distribution patterns of these genera in Argentina through an updated database built from published records as well as from own sample collections. These genera are represented in Argentina by a total of 18 species distributed in 14 provinces and 10 ecoregions. The ecoregions with greatest biodiversity were Paranense Forest, Yungas, Campos and Malezales. This database will also allow generating distribution maps for these mosquito genera, and their respective species in Argentina, to establish areas with high probability of viral circulation that are an essential input for vector surveillance, as a tool for public health decision-makers.",-1
"SK119, a Novel Shikonin Derivative, Leads to Apoptosis in Melanoma Cell Lines and Exhibits Synergistic Effects with Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib","Melanoma is a complex and heterogenous disease, displays the deadliest form of skin cancer, and accounts for approx. 80% of all skin cancer deaths. In this study, we reported on the synthesis and pharmacological effects of a novel shikonin derivative (SK119), which is active in a nano-molar range and exhibits several promising in vitro effects in different human melanoma cells. SK119 was synthesized from shikonin as part of our search for novel, promising shikonin derivatives. It was screened against a panel of melanoma and non-tumorigenic cell lines using XTT viability assays. Moreover, we studied its pharmacological effects using apoptosis and Western blot experiments. Finally, it was combined with current clinically used melanoma therapeutics. SK119 exhibited IC50 values in a nano-molar range, induced apoptosis and led to a dose-dependent increase in the expression and protein phosphorylation of HSP27 and HSP90 in WM9 and MUG-Mel 2 cells. Combinatorial treatment, which is highly recommended in melanoma, revealed the synergistic effects of SK119 with vemurafenib and cobimetinib. SK119 treatment changed the expression levels of apoptosis genes and death receptor expression and exhibited synergistic effects with vemurafenib and cobimetinib in human melanoma cells. Further research indicates a promising potential in melanoma therapy.",-1
Use of an aromatase inhibitor in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia: Impact of anastrozole on bone mineral density and visceral adipose tissue,"Objective:                    Anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, has been used off-label in males with short stature to delay bone maturation. No studies have examined anastrozole's effect on bone mineral density (BMD) or body composition in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Our objective was to evaluate anastrozole's effect on BMD and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in children with CAH.              Design:                    Total body BMD (TBMD) and L2-L4 BMD Z-scores were adjusted for height-for-age Z-scores (TBMDHAZ and L2-L4HAZ ). Hydrocortisone doses (mg/m2 /d) were averaged over the previous year. Comparison of treated vs not treated with anastrozole used linear regression adjusting for age, pubertal status, sex, CAH type, years on hydrocortisone, BMI Z-scores and bone age Z-scores.              Patients:                    We compared 25 children with CAH treated with anastrozole (mean age 11.3 [SD 3.0] years, 56% males) vs 31 children with CAH not treated with anastrozole (13.5 [SD 4.6], 29%). Participants underwent a pubertal exam, bone age X-ray and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan.              Results:                    Average bone age Z-score of 4.3 SDs on beginning anastrozole decreased to 1.9 SDs at time of DXA exam (P = 0.0004) 5.2 (SD 2.2) years later. TBMD Z-scores (P = 0.51), L2-L4 BMD Z-scores (P = 0.66), VAT (P = 0.38), TBMDHAZ Z-scores (P = 0.66) and L2-L4HAZ Z-scores (P = 0.41) did not differ between children treated vs not treated with anastrozole.              Conclusion:                    Anastrozole significantly reduced bone age advancement in children with CAH and advanced bone age (>2SDs) without adverse effects on BMD or VAT. Longitudinal studies of anastrozole in children with CAH are needed to validate these findings.",-1
Microbial Diversity of Adult Aedes aegypti and Water Collected from Different Mosquito Aquatic Habitats in Puerto Rico,"Mosquitoes, the major vectors of viruses like dengue, are naturally host to diverse microorganisms, which play an important role in their development, fecundity, immunity, and vector competence. The composition of their microbiota is strongly influenced by the environment, particularly their aquatic larval habitat. In this study, we used 2Ã300 bp 16s Illumina sequencing to compare the microbial profiles of emerging adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and the water collected from common types of aquatic habitat containers in Puerto Rico, which has endemic dengue transmission. We sequenced 141 mosquito and 46 water samples collected from plastic containers, septic tanks, discarded tires, underground trash cans, tree holes, or water meters. We identified 9 bacterial genera that were highly prevalent in the mosquito microbiome, and 77 for the microbiome of the aquatic habitat. The most abundant mosquito-associated bacterial OTUs were from the families Burkholderiaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae. Microbial profiles varied greatly between mosquitoes, and there were few major differences explained by container type; however, the microbiome of mosquitoes from plastic containers was more diverse and contained more unique taxa than the other groups. Container water was significantly more diverse than mosquitoes, and our data suggest that mosquitoes filter out many bacteria, with Alphaproteobacteria in particular being far more abundant in water. These findings provide novel insight into the microbiome of mosquitoes in the region and provide a platform to improve our understanding of the fundamental mosquito-microbe interactions.",-1
Role of miRNAs in Neurodegeneration: From Disease Cause to Tools of Biomarker Discovery and Therapeutics,"Neurodegenerative diseases originate from neuronal loss in the central nervous system (CNS). These debilitating diseases progress with age and have become common due to an increase in longevity. The National Institute of Environmental Health Science's 2021 annual report suggests around 6.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, and there is a possibility that there will be 1.2 million Parkinson's disease patients in the USA by 2030. There is no clear-cut universal mechanism for identifying neurodegenerative diseases, and therefore, they pose a challenge for neurobiology scientists. Genetic and environmental factors modulate these diseases leading to familial or sporadic forms. Prior studies have shown that miRNA levels are altered during the course of the disease, thereby suggesting that these noncoding RNAs may be the contributing factor in neurodegeneration. In this review, we highlight the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Through this review, we aim to achieve four main objectives: First, we highlight how dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis led to these diseases. Second, we highlight the computational or bioinformatics tools required to identify the putative molecular targets of miRNAs, leading to biological molecular pathways or mechanisms involved in these diseases. Third, we focus on the dysregulation of miRNAs and their target genes leading to several neurodegenerative diseases. In the final section, we highlight the use of miRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers in the early asymptomatic preclinical diagnosis of these age-dependent debilitating diseases. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and advances in the development of miRNA therapeutics for brain targeting. We list some of the innovative strategies employed to deliver miRNA into target cells and the relevance of these viral and non-viral carrier systems in RNA therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, this review highlights the relevance of studying brain-enriched miRNAs, the mechanisms underlying their regulation of target gene expression, their dysregulation leading to progressive neurodegeneration, and their potential for biomarker marker and therapeutic intervention. This review thereby highlights ways for the effective diagnosis and prevention of these neurodegenerative disorders in the near future.",-1
Theabrownin-targeted regulation of intestinal microorganisms to improve glucose and lipid metabolism in Goto-Kakizaki rats,"Diabetes is a disease that is characterized by a disturbance of glucose metabolism. Theabrownin (TB) is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea, and it is a brown pigment with multiple aromatic rings and attached residues of polysaccharides and proteins. TB has been shown to be hypolipidemic and displays fasting blood glucose (FBG)-lowering properties in rats fed a high-fat diet, but the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. This study aimed to determine the effect of TB in treating diabetes and explore the underlying mechanism of action of intestinal microbes by using Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. Diabetic GK rats were treated up to 8 weeks with TB (GK-TB). Following treatment, the body weight, triglyceride (TG) content, fasting blood glucose (FBG) content, and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly lower in the GK-TB group than in the GK control group (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the circulating adiponectin (ADPN), leptin, and glucokinase levels in the serum of the GK-TB group were significantly higher than those in the GK group, while there was little difference in hepatic lipase (HL) and hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase (HSL) enzyme activities (P > 0.05). Furthermore, with the extension of treatment time, the number of unique intestinal microorganisms in GK rats greatly increased and an interaction among intestinal microorganisms was observed. The Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio was decreased significantly, and the composition of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria was increased. The use of multiple omics technologies showed that TB is involved in the targeted regulation of the core characteristic intestinal flora including Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT), Lactobacillus murinus (LM), Parabacteroides distasonis (PD), and Bacteroides_acidifaciens (BA) which improved the glucose and lipid metabolism of GK rats via the AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, bile secretion and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Intragastric administration of BT, LM, PD, or BA led to a significantly reduced HOMA-IR in GK rats. Furthermore, BT significantly reduced serum lipid TG and total cholesterol (TC) and BA significantly reduced the serum lipid TC and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). PD significantly reduced serum LDL, while the effect of LM was not significant. However, LM and PD significantly increased the content of ADPN in serum. Taken together, our results indicated that the effect of TB on diabetic rats mainly depends on the targeted regulation of intestinal microorganisms and that TB is a functional food component with great potential to treat or prevent diabetes.",-1
Future Applications of Real-World Neuroimaging to Clinical Psychology,"Clinical neuroimaging has largely been limited to examining the neurophysiological outcomes of treatments for psychiatric conditions rather than the neurocognitive mechanisms by which these outcomes are brought about as a function of clinical strategies, and the cognitive neuroscientific research aiming to investigate these mechanisms in nonclinical and clinical populations has been ecologically challenged by the extent to which tasks represent and generalize to intervention strategies. However, recent technological and methodological advancements to neuroimaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy and functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based hyperscanning provide novel opportunities to investigate the mechanisms of change in more naturalistic and interactive settings, representing a unique prospect for improving our understanding of the intra- and interbrain systems supporting the recogitation of dysfunctional cognitive operations.",-1
A Fluorescence-Polarization-Based Lipopolysaccharide-Caspase-4 Interaction Assay for the Development of Inhibitors,"Recognition of intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by Caspase-4 (Casp-4) is critical for host defense against Gram-negative pathogens. LPS binds to the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of procaspase-4, leading to auto-proteolytic activation followed by pro-inflammatory cytokine release and pyroptotic cell death. Aberrant hyper-activation of Casp-4 leads to amplification of the inflammatory response linked to sepsis. While the active site of a caspase has been targeted with peptide inhibitors, inhibition of LPS-Casp-4 interaction is an emerging strategy for the development of selective inhibitors with a new mode of action for treating infectious diseases and sepsis induced by LPS. In this study, a high-throughput screening (HTS) system based on fluorescence polarization (FP) was devised to identify inhibitors of the LPS and Casp-4 interaction. Using HTS and IC50 determination and subsequently showing inhibited Casp-4 activity, we demonstrated that the LPS-Casp-4 interaction is a druggable target for Casp-4 inhibition and possibly a non-canonical inflammatory pathway.",-1
Detection of Flaviviral-Like DNA Sequences in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) Collected From Argentina,"Diseases caused by flaviviruses are a major public health burden across the world. In the past decades, South America has suffered dengue epidemics, the re-emergence of yellow fever and St. Louis encephalitis viruses, and the introduction of West Nile and Zika viruses. Many insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) that cannot replicate in vertebrate cells have recently been described. In this study, we analyzed field-collected mosquito samples from six different ecoregions of Argentina to detect flaviviruses. We did not find any RNA belonging to pathogenic flaviviruses or ISFs in adults or immature stages. However, flaviviral-like DNA similar to flavivirus NS5 region was detected in 83-100% of Aedes aegypti (L.). Despite being previously described as an ancient element in the Ae. aegypti genome, the flaviviral-like DNA sequence was not detected in all Ae. aegypti samples and sequences obtained did not form a monophyletic group, possibly reflecting the genetic diversity of mosquito populations in Argentina.",-1
Recent Advanced Deep Learning Architectures for Retinal Fluid Segmentation on Optical Coherence Tomography Images,"With non-invasive and high-resolution properties, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been widely used as a retinal imaging modality for the effective diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. The retinal fluid is often segmented by medical experts as a pivotal biomarker to assist in the clinical diagnosis of age-related macular diseases, diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion. In recent years, the advanced machine learning methods, such as deep learning paradigms, have attracted more and more attention from academia in the retinal fluid segmentation applications. The automatic retinal fluid segmentation based on deep learning can improve the semantic segmentation accuracy and efficiency of macular change analysis, which has potential clinical implications for ophthalmic pathology detection. This article summarizes several different deep learning paradigms reported in the up-to-date literature for the retinal fluid segmentation in OCT images. The deep learning architectures include the backbone of convolutional neural network (CNN), fully convolutional network (FCN), U-shape network (U-Net), and the other hybrid computational methods. The article also provides a survey on the prevailing OCT image datasets used in recent retinal segmentation investigations. The future perspectives and some potential retinal segmentation directions are discussed in the concluding context.",-1
"Abundance and Seasonality of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Two Suburban Localities of South Mexico, With Implications for Wolbachia (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae)-Carrying Male Releases for Population Suppression","We conducted a baseline characterization of the abundance and seasonality of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762)-a vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika-in two suburban localities of Yucatan, Mexico, as the first step in the implementation of an integrated vector management (IVM) plan combining 'traditional Aedes control' (source reduction/truck-mounted ultra-low volume [ULV] spraying) and incompatible insect technique/sterile insect technique for population suppression in Yucatan, Mexico. Weekly entomological collections with ovitraps and BG-sentinel traps were performed in 1-ha quadrants of both localities for 1 yr. Three distinct periods/phases were identified, closely associated with precipitation: 1) a phase of low population abundance during the dry season (weekly average of Aedes eggs per ovitrap and adults per BG trap = 15.51 Â± 0.71 and 10.07 Â± 0.88, respectively); 2) a phase of population growth and greatest abundance of Aedes (49.03 Â± 1.48 eggs and 25.69 Â± 1.31 adults) during the rainy season; and finally 3) a phase of decline among populations (20.91 Â± 0.97 eggs and 3.24 Â± 0.21 adults) after the peak of the rainy season. Seasonal abundance and dynamics of Ae. aegypti populations suggest that it is feasible to develop and implement time-specific actions as part of an IVM approach incorporating integrating novel technologies (such as rear-and-release of Wolbachia-infected males) with classic (insecticide-based) approaches implemented routinely for vector control. In agreement with the local vector control program, we propose a pilot IVM strategy structured in a preparation phase, an attack phase with traditional vector control, and a suppression phase with inundative releases, which are described in this paper.",-1
MiR-466b-3p/HDAC7 meditates transgenerational inheritance of testicular testosterone synthesis inhibition induced by prenatal dexamethasone exposure,"The adverse environment during pregnancy could change epigenetic modifications in germ cells, leading to transgenerational effects. This study aims to explore transgenerational-inheritance of inhibited testicular testosterone synthesis induced by prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) and its mechanism. Wistar pregnant rats were subcutaneously injected with 0.2 mg/kg.d dexamethasone at gestational-day (GD) 9-20. Blood and testes of F1/F3 were obtained by maternal inheritance before and after birth. Meanwhile, Leydig cells were treated with dexamethasone and related interventions to confirm its direct effect and mechanism. The results showed that, in PDE F1 fetus, the serum testosterone level decreased, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) decreased, and imprinted miR-466b-3p reduced, histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) upregulated, histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) level of StAR promoter decreased in testis. Meanwhile, consistent changes were observed in F1/F3 testes. In addition, miR-466b-3p expression in PDE F1/F2 oocytes also decreased. Further, series cell interventions confirmed that dexamethasone could reduce imprinted miR-466b-3p expression, increase HDAC7 expression, and reduce StAR acetylation level and expression by glucocorticoid receptor, finally causing testosterone synthesis inhibition. This study provided an experimental basis for confirming the developmental toxicity in offspring testis induced by PDE and its maternal transgenerational inheritance, offering a potential target for early warning and intervention therapy.",-1
Renal Cell Cancer and Obesity,"Cancers are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. There are many risk factors for tumours, including advanced age, personal or family history of cancer, some types of viral infections, exposure to radiation and some chemicals, smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as obesity. Increasing evidence suggest the role of obesity in the initiation and progression of various cancers, including renal cell carcinoma. Since tumours require energy for their uncontrollable growth, it appears plausible that their initiation and development is associated with the dysregulation of cells metabolism. Thus, any state characterised by an intake of excessive energy and nutrients may favour the development of various cancers. There are many factors that promote the development of renal cell carcinoma, including hypoxia, inflammation, insulin resistance, excessive adipose tissue and adipokines and others. There are also many obesity-related alterations in genes expression, including DNA methylation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, histone modification and miRNAs that can promote renal carcinogenesis. This review focuses on the impact of obesity on the risk of renal cancers development, their aggressiveness and patients' survival.",-1
Effect of omalizumab use on glucose homeostasis in non-diabetic patients with chronic urticaria,"Purpose:                    In some diabetic patients receiving omalizumab therapy, blood glucose regulation is impaired. However, the effect of omalizumab on glucose homeostasis in non-diabetic patients remains unknown.              Methods:                    The patients were given subcutaneous omalizumab at a dose of 300 mg every four weeks for the treatment of chronic urticaria in this study. Fasting blood glucose, fasting plasma insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were studied before and at the 12th week of treatment. The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to determine insulin resistance.              Results:                    Forty of the 45 patients included in the study completed 12 weeks of treatment. While fasting blood glucoses (p = 0.011) and HOMA-IR values (p = 0.027) were significantly increased in the 12th week, the increase in fasting insulin level was not significant (p = 0.07). After treatment, 10 patients developed impaired fasting glucose and 13 developed insulin resistance.              Conclusion:                    The increase in blood glucose levels may be associated with the paradoxically increase of histamine levels in the blood by omalizumab. If this increase cannot be balanced with insulin, patients may develop impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Therefore, we suggest that patients using omalizumab should be followed up for glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance.",-1
Deep Learning-Based Multimodal 3 T MRI for the Diagnosis of Knee Osteoarthritis,"The objective of this study was to investigate the application effect of deep learning model combined with different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences in the evaluation of cartilage injury of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Specifically, an image superresolution algorithm based on an improved multiscale wide residual network model was proposed and compared with the single-shot multibox detector (SSD) algorithm, superresolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) algorithm, and enhanced deep superresolution (EDSR) algorithm. Meanwhile, 104 patients with KOA diagnosed with cartilage injury were selected as the research subjects and underwent MRI scans, and the diagnostic performance of different MRI sequences was analyzed using arthroscopic results as the gold standard. It was found that the image reconstructed by the model in this study was clear enough, with minimum noise and artifacts, and the overall quality was better than that processed by other algorithms. Arthroscopic analysis found that grade I and grade II lesions concentrated on patella (26) and femoral trochlear (15). In addition to involving the patella and femoral trochlea, grade III and grade IV lesions gradually developed into the medial and lateral articular cartilage. The 3D-DS-WE sequence was found to be the best sequence for diagnosing KOA injury, with high diagnostic accuracy of over 95% in grade IV lesions. The consistency test showed that the 3D-DESS-WE sequence and T2â?mapping sequence had a strong consistency with the results of arthroscopy, and the Kappa consistency test values were 0.748 and 0.682, respectively. In conclusion, MRI based on deep learning could clearly show the cartilage lesions of KOA. Of different MRI sequences, 3D-DS-WE sequence and T2â?mapping sequence showed the best diagnosis results for different degrees of KOA injury.",-1
The Different Molecular Code in Generation of Dopaminergic Neurons from Astrocytes and Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Transplantation of exogenous dopaminergic (DA) neurons is an alternative strategy to replenish DA neurons that have lost along the course of Parkinson's disease (PD). From the perspective of ethical acceptation, the source limitations, and the intrinsic features of PD pathology, astrocytes (AS) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the two promising candidates of DA induction. In the present study, we induced AS or MSCs primary culture by the combination of the classical transcription-factor cocktails Mash1, Lmx1a, and Nurr1 (MLN), the chemical cocktails (S/C/D), and the morphogens SHH, FGF8, and FGF2 (S/F8/F2); the efficiency of induction into DA neurons was further analyzed by using immunostaining against the DA neuronal markers. AS could be efficiently converted into the DA neurons in vitro by the transcriptional regulation of MLN, and the combination with S/C/D or S/F8/F2 further increased the conversion efficiency. In contrast, MSCs from umbilical cord (UC-MSCs) or adipose tissue (AD-MSCs) showed moderate TH immunoreactivity after the induction with S/F8/F2 instead of with MLN or S/C/D. Our data demonstrated that AS and MSCs held lineage-specific molecular codes on the induction into DA neurons and highlighted the unique superiority of AS in the potential of cell replacement therapy for PD.",-1
Mosquito Attractants,"Vector control and personal protection against anthropophilic mosquitoes mainly rely on the use of insecticides and repellents. The search for mosquito-attractive semiochemicals has been the subject of intense studies for decades, and new compounds or odor blends are regularly proposed as lures for odor-baited traps. We present a comprehensive and up-to-date review of all the studies that have evaluated the attractiveness of volatiles to mosquitoes, including individual chemical compounds, synthetic blends of compounds, or natural host or plant odors. A total of 388 studies were analysed, and our survey highlights the existence of 105 attractants (77 volatile compounds, 17 organism odors, and 11 synthetic blends) that have been proved effective in attracting one or several mosquito species. The exhaustive list of these attractants is presented in various tables, while the most common mosquito attractants - for which effective attractiveness has been demonstrated in numerous studies - are discussed throughout the text. The increasing knowledge on compounds attractive to mosquitoes may now serve as the basis for complementary vector control strategies, such as those involving lure-and-kill traps, or the development of mass trapping. This review also points out the necessity of further improving the search for new volatile attractants, such as new compound blends in specific ratios, considering that mosquito attraction to odors may vary over the life of the mosquito or among species. Finally, the use of mosquito attractants will undoubtedly have an increasingly important role to play in future integrated vector management programs.",-1
miR-542-3p-Targeted PDE4D Regulates cAMP/PKA Signaling Pathway and Improves Cardiomyocyte Injury,"Objective:                    To investigate the protective effect of miR-542-3p on cardiomyocyte injury and related mechanisms.              Methods:                    A cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation model was established. The expression levels of miR-542-3p and PDE4D were detected using qRT-PCR; the luciferase reporter assay system was used to detect the targeting relationship between miR-542-3p and PDE4D; overexpressing miR-542-3p was transfected into cardiomyocytes, and ROS release was detected by immunofluorescence while cellular apoptosis was detected by TUNEL; and the western blot assay was applied to detect the expression of PDE4D, phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA), and phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (p-CREB).              Results:                    Compared with the control group, the miR-542-3p expression level was decreased and the PDE4D expression level was increased in the cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation model group. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system confirmed that miR-542-3p could target and regulate PDE4D; the transfection with cardiomyocytes using the overexpressing miR-542-3p could downregulate PDE4D expression, attenuate ROS release during cardiomyocyte injury, and reduce cellular apoptosis rate, while upregulating the expression of p-PKA and p-CREB.              Conclusion:                    The miR-542-3p can negatively regulate PDE4D protein expression and attenuate cardiomyocyte injury through a mechanism related to the activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.",-1
"Emergence of the invasive Asian bush mosquito, Aedes (Finlaya) japonicus japonicus, in an urban area, Romania","Background:                    A study conducted at the International Airport of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, with the aim of investigating the presence/absence of invasive Aedes mosquito species resulted in finding Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald 1901) eggs in one of the ovitraps placed on site.              Methods:                    The study was carried out between 30 June and 29 September 2020. On 24 August, 26 eggs were collected and later hatched at the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Cluj-Napoca's insectary. On 15 October another adult female Ae. japonicus was caught entering a building in the center of the city, about 7 km from the first sampling spot.              Results:                    The mosquitoes were identified morphologically and confirmed by molecular analysis, based on the genetic analysis of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI).              Conclusion:                    This is the first report of the species in Romania, highlighting the need for surveillance and implemented control methods. However, in Romania to our knowledge only Aedes albopictus has been established; further studies are required to learn about this new invasive species' status in Romania.",-1
Circular RNA Profiles in Viremia and ART Suppression Predict Competing circRNA-miRNA-mRNA Networks Exclusive to HIV-1 Viremic Patients,"Since the onset of the HIV-1/AIDS epidemic in 1981, 75 million people have been infected with the virus, and the disease remains a public health crisis worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are derived from excised exons and introns during backsplicing, a form of alternative splicing. The relevance of unconventional, non-capped, and non-poly(A) transcripts to transcriptomics studies remains to be routinely investigated. Knowledge gaps to be filled are the interface between host-encoded circRNAs and viral replication in chronically progressed patients and upon treatment with antiviral drugs. We implemented a bioinformatic pipeline and repurpose publicly archived RNA sequence reads from the blood of 19 HIV-1-positive patients that previously compared transcriptomes during viremia and viremia suppression by antiretroviral therapy (ART). The in silico analysis identified viremic patients' circRNA that became undetectable after ART. The circRNAs originated from a subset of host genes enriched in the HDAC biological pathway. These circRNAs and parental mRNAs held in common a small collection of miRNA response elements (MREs), some of which were present in HIV-1 mRNAs. The function of the MRE-containing target mRNA enriched the RNA polymerase II GO pathway. To visualize the interplay between individual circRNA-miRNA-target mRNA, important for HIV-1 and potentially other diseases, an Interactive Circos tool was developed to efficiently parse the intricately competing endogenous network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions originating from seven circRNA singled out in viremic versus non-viremic patients. The combined downregulation of the identified circRNAs warrants investigation as a novel antiviral targeting strategy.",-1
Increased size and energy reserves in diapausing eggs of temperate Aedes aegypti populations,"Many insects overwinter in diapause, a pre-programmed anticipated response to unfavorable environmental conditions, often induced by a short-day photoperiod. Diapause involves morphological changes and increased energy stores required for metabolic demands during winter. In diapausing mosquito eggs, the accumulation of lipids plays an important role, because these molecules are the primary fuel consumed during embryogenesis and pharate larvae metabolism, and have a key role in egg desiccation resistance. The supposed inability of the mosquito Aedes aegypti to lay diapausing eggs has been recently challenged by a study on a temperate population, which showed that the inhibition of egg hatching in response to short days is possible in this species. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of parental photoperiod on embryonic diapause-related traits, such as the triglyceride content and size of eggs laid, of two populations whose localities of origin differ in their winter length. Two colonies were maintained for each population: one under a Short-Day Photoperiod (SD: 10 h:14 h - Light:Dark) and the other under a Long-Day Photoperiod (LD: 14 h:10 h - Light:Dark). The eggs obtained from each combination of population and light treatment were used for size measurement (length, width and volume) and for the quantification of triglyceride content. Egg size showed differences between photoperiod treatments, with larger width and volume in eggs from the SD treatment. Remarkably, eggs from the SD treatment accumulated twice as many triglycerides as those from the LD treatment. Also, the eggs derived from the population having the longer winter accumulated larger amounts of triglycerides. The higher lipid content is probably contributing to a better survival during the cold season in both populations. The photoperiod-induced response in egg size and amount of triglycerides observed in this study support the hypothesis that the Ae. aegypti populations studied are able to lay diapausing eggs, a fact that provides physiological bases for the further expansion of this species to colder regions.",-1
Fully automated deep learning-based localization and segmentation of the locus coeruleus in aging and Parkinson's disease using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI,Purpose:                    Development and performance measurement of a fully automated pipeline that localizes and segments the locus coeruleus in so-called neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging data for the derivation of quantitative biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.              Methods:                    We propose a pipeline composed of several 3D-Unet-based convolutional neural networks for iterative multi-scale localization and multi-rater segmentation and non-deep learning-based components for automated biomarker extraction. We trained on the healthy aging cohort and did not carry out any adaption or fine-tuning prior to the application to Parkinson's disease subjects.              Results:                    The localization and segmentation pipeline demonstrated sufficient performance as measured by Euclidean distance (on average around 1.3mm on healthy aging subjects and 2.2mm in Parkinson's disease subjects) and Dice similarity coefficient (overall around [Formula: see text] on healthy aging subjects and [Formula: see text] for subjects with Parkinson's disease) as well as promising agreement with respect to contrast ratios in terms of intraclass correlation coefficient of [Formula: see text] for healthy aging subjects compared to a manual segmentation procedure. Lower values ([Formula: see text]) for Parkinson's disease subjects indicate the need for further investigation and tests before the application to clinical samples.              Conclusion:                    These promising results suggest the usability of the proposed algorithm for data of healthy aging subjects and pave the way for further investigations using this approach on different clinical datasets to validate its practical usability more conclusively.,-1
Reconfigurable Artificial Synapses with Excitatory and Inhibitory Response Enabled by an Ambipolar Oxide Thin-Film Transistor,"A gate-tunable synaptic device controlling dynamically reconfigurable excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses, which can emulate the fundamental synaptic responses for developing diverse functionalities of the biological nervous system, was developed using ambipolar oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs). Since the balanced ambipolarity is significant, a boron-incorporated SnO (SnO:B) oxide semiconductor channel was newly developed to improve the ambipolar charge transports by reducing the subgap defect density, which was reduced to less than 1017 cm-3. The ambipolar SnO:B-TFT could be fabricated with a good reproductivity at the maximum process temperature of 250 Â°C and exhibited good TFT performances, such as a nearly zero switching voltage, the saturation mobility of â?.3 cm2 V-1 s-1, s-value of â?.1 V decade-1, and an on/off-current ratio of â? Ã 103 for the p-channel mode, while â?.14 cm2 V-1 s-1, â?.2 V decade-1and â? Ã 103 for n-channel modes, respectively. The ambipolar device imitated potentiation/depression behaviors in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic responses by using the p- and n-channel transports by tuning a gate bias. The low-power consumptions of <20 and <2 nJ per pulse for the excitatory and inhibitory operations, respectively, were also achieved. The presented device operated under an ambient atmosphere and confirmed a good operation reliability over 5000 pulses and a long-term air environmental stability. The study presents the high potential of an ambipolar oxide-TFT-based synaptic device with a good manufacturability to develop emerging neuromorphic perception and computing hardware for next-generation artificial intelligence systems.",-1
A Magnetic-Bead-Based Mosquito DNA Extraction Protocol for Next-Generation Sequencing,"A recently published DNA extraction protocol using magnetic beads and an automated DNA extraction instrument suggested that it is possible to extract high quality and quantity DNA from a well-preserved individual mosquito sufficient for downstream whole genome sequencing. However, reliance on an expensive automated DNA extraction instrument can be prohibitive for many laboratories. Here, the study provides a budget-friendly magnetic-bead-based DNA extraction protocol, which is suitable for low to medium throughput. The protocol described here was successfully tested using individual Aedes aegypti mosquito samples. The reduced costs associated with high quality DNA extraction will increase the application of high throughput sequencing to resource limited labs and studies.",-1
Impact of migraine on workplace productivity and monetary loss: a study of employees in banking sector in Malaysia,"Background/objective:                    Productivity and monetary loss due to migraine in the workplace may be substantial. This study aimed to determine the impact of migraine on productivity and monetary lost among employees in the banking sectors, in a multiethnic middle income country.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among employees in two multinational banks in Malaysia between April and July 2019. Screening for migraine was conducted using the self-administered ID-Migraineâ?questionnaire. Migraine-related disability (MIDAS) and headache frequency were recorded. Impact of migraine on work productivity and activities were evaluated using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire.              Results:                    Of the 1268 employees who submitted complete responses, 47.2% (n = 598) were screened positive for migraine. Strikingly, the mean percent productivity loss at work (presenteeism) was almost 20-fold higher than the mean percent work time missed due to migraine (absenteeism) (39.1% versus 1.9%). The mean percent productivity loss in regular activity (activity impairment) and overall work productivity loss (work impairment) was 38.4% and 39.9%, respectively. It was also found that the costs related to presenteeism (MYR 5392.6) (US$1296) was 3.5-fold higher than absenteeism (MYR1,548.3) (US$370). Highest monetary loss related to presenteeism was reported in migraineurs with frequency of headache of above 3 days (MYR 25,691.2) (US$6176), whereas highest monetary loss related to absenteeism was reported in migraineurs with MIDAS grade IV (MYR 12,369.1) (US$2973). Only 30% of migraineurs of MIDAS grade IV reported taking prescribed medication. Notably, a vast majority (96%) of migraineurs who had three or lower episodes of migraine per month did not seek treatment.              Conclusion:                    The significant impact of migraine on work productivity and regular activity, appears to lead to substantial monetary loss attributed to not only absenteeism, but more importantly to presenteeism. This study also highlights the unmet needs in migraine management among employees in the banking sector.",-1
Artificial intelligence for forecasting and diagnosing COVID-19 pandemic: A focused review,"The outbreak of novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) has been treated as a public health crisis of global concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 pandemic hugely affected countries worldwide raising the need to exploit novel, alternative and emerging technologies to respond to the emergency created by the weak health-care systems. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can give a valid support to public health authorities, complementing traditional approaches with advanced tools. This study provides a comprehensive review of methods, algorithms, applications, and emerging AI technologies that can be utilized for forecasting and diagnosing COVID-19. The main objectives of this review are summarized as follows.

Superior acetone sensor based on hetero-interface of SnSe 2/SnO 2 quasi core shell nanoparticles for previewing diabetes,"To improve gas sensing performance of SnO2 sensor, a heterostructure constructed by SnO2 and SnSe2 is designed and synthesized via hydrothermal method and post thermal oxidation treatment. The obtained SnSe2/SnO2 composite nanoparticles demonstrate a special core-shell structure with SnO2 nanograins distributed in the shell and mixed SnSe2 and SnO2 nanograins in the core. Owning to the promoted charge transfer effect invited by SnSe2, the sensor based on SnSe2/SnO2 composite nanoparticles exhibit expressively enhanced acetone sensing performance compared to the pristine SnO2 sensor. At the working temperature of 300 Â°C, the SnSe2/SnO2 composite sensor with optimized composition exhibits superior sensing property towards acetone, including high response (10.77-100 ppm), low theoretical limit of detection (0.354 ppm), high selectivity and good reproducibility. Moreover, the sensor shows a satisfactory sensing performance in trace acetone gas detection under high humidity condition (relative humidity: 70-90%), making it a promising candidate to constructing exhaled breath sensors for acetone detection.",-1
Fine-Tuning Plant Gene Expression with Synthetic Trans-Acting Small Interfering RNAs,"RNAi-based tools are widely used in gene function studies and for crop improvement. However, no effective methods for precisely controlling the degree of induced silencing have been reported until recently. Here we report a detailed protocol for designing and generating synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNA (syn-tasiRNA) constructs for fine-tuning gene expression in plants. Recently developed high-throughput AtTAS1c-D2-B/c-based vectors are used to clone and express syn-tasiRNAs that possess different efficacies depending on their precursor location and on their degree of base-pairing with the 5' end of target RNAs.",-1
Task allocation in multi-robot system using resource sharing with dynamic threshold approach,"Task allocation is a fundamental requirement for multi-robot systems working in dynamic environments. An efficient task allocation algorithm allows the robots to adjust their behavior in response to environmental changes such as fault occurrences, or other robots' actions to increase overall system performance. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Task Allocation technique based on a threshold level which is an accumulative value aggregated by a centralized unit using the Task-Robot ratio and the number of the available resource in the system. The threshold level serves as a reference for task acceptance and the task acceptance occurs despite resource shortage. The deficient resources for the accepted task are acquired through an auction process using objective minimization. Despite resource shortage, task acceptance occurs. The threshold approach and the objective minimization in the auction process reduce the overall completion time and increase the system's resource utilization up to 96%, which is demonstrated theoretically and validated through simulations and real experimentation.",-1
A deep learning approach for orphan gene identification in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) based on the CNN + Transformer model,"Background:                    Orphan gene play an important role in the environmental stresses of many species and their identification is a critical step to understand biological functions. Moso bamboo has high ecological, economic and cultural value. Studies have shown that the growth of moso bamboo is influenced by various stresses. Several traditional methods are time-consuming and inefficient. Hence, the development of efficient and high-accuracy computational methods for predicting orphan genes is of great significance.              Results:                    In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model (CNN + Transformer) for identifying orphan genes in moso bamboo. It uses a convolutional neural network in combination with a transformer neural network to capture k-mer amino acids and features between k-mer amino acids in protein sequences. The experimental results show that the average balance accuracy value of CNN + Transformer on moso bamboo dataset can reach 0.875, and the average Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) value can reach 0.471. For the same testing set, the Balance Accuracy (BA), Geometric Mean (GM), Bookmaker Informedness (BM), and MCC values of the recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, and transformer models are all lower than those of CNN + Transformer, which indicated that the model has the extensive ability for OG identification in moso bamboo.              Conclusions:                    CNN + Transformer model is feasible and obtains the credible predictive results. It may also provide valuable references for other related research. As our knowledge, this is the first model to adopt the deep learning techniques for identifying orphan genes in plants.",-1
Beta HPV Deregulates Double-Strand Break Repair,"Beta human papillomavirus (beta HPV) infections are common in adults. Certain types of beta HPVs are associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in immunocompromised individuals. However, whether beta HPV infections promote NMSC in the immunocompetent population is unclear. They have been hypothesized to increase genomic instability stemming from ultraviolet light exposure by disrupting DNA damage responses. Implicit in this hypothesis is that the virus encodes one or more proteins that impair DNA repair signaling. Fluorescence-based reporters, next-generation sequencing, and animal models have been used to test this primarily in cells expressing beta HPV E6/E7. Of the two, beta HPV E6 appears to have the greatest ability to increase UV mutagenesis, by attenuating two major double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, homologous recombination, and non-homologous end-joining. Here, we review this dysregulation of DSB repair and emerging approaches that can be used to further these efforts.",-1
miR-731 modulates the zebrafish heart morphogenesis via targeting Calcineurin/Nfatc3a pathway,"Background:                    Zebrafish miR-731 is orthologous of human miR-425, which has been demonstrated to have cardio-protective roles by a variety of mechanisms. The miR-731 morphants show pericardium enlargement, and many DEGs (differentially expressed genes) are enriched in 'Cardiac muscle contraction' and 'Calcium signaling pathway', implying that miR-731 plays a potential role in heart function and development. Howeverï¼the in vivo physiological role of miR-731 in the heart needs to be fully defined.              Methods:                    Zebrafish miR-731 morphants were generated by morpholino knockdown, and miR-731 knockout zebrafish was generated by CRISRP/Cas9. We observed cardiac morphogenesis based on whole-mount in situ hybridization. Furthermore, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were used to elucidate the molecular mechanism and analyze the gene expression. Double luciferase verification and Western blot were used to verify the target gene.              Results:                    The depletion of miR-731 in zebrafish embryos caused the deficiency of cardiac development and function, which was associated with reduced heart rate, ventricular enlargement and heart looping disorder. In addition, mechanistic study demonstrated that Calcineurin/Nfatc3a signaling involved in miR-731 depletion induced abnormal cardiac function and developmental defects.              Conclusion:                    MiR-731 regulates cardiac function and morphogenesis through Calcineurin/Nfatc3a signaling.              General significance:                    Our studies highlight the potential importance of miR-731 in cardiac development.",-1
Novel Genetic Locus of Visceral Fat and Systemic Inflammation,"Context:                    Visceral fat (VF), more than fat elsewhere in the body [mostly subcutaneous fat (SF)], promotes systemic inflammation and related disease. The mechanisms of preferentially visceral accumulation of body fat are largely unknown.              Objective:                    To identify genetic loci and mechanistic pathways of preferential accumulation of VF and associated low-grade systemic inflammation.              Design:                    Genome-wide association study (GWAS).              Setting and participants:                    Population-based cohort of 1586 adolescents (aged 12 to 19 years) and adults (aged 36 to 65 years).              Main outcome measures:                    Abdominal VF and SF were measured with MRI, total body fat (TBF) was assessed with bioimpedance, and low-grade systemic inflammation was examined by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement.              Results:                    This GWAS of preferential accumulation of VF identified a significant locus on chromosome 6 at rs803522 (P = 1.1 Ã 10-9 or 4.3 Ã 10-10 for VF adjusted for SF or TBF, respectively). The major allele was associated with more VF; the association was similar in adolescents and adults. The allele was also associated with higher CRP level, but this association was stronger in adults than adolescents (P for interaction = 4.5 Ã 10-3). In adults, VF was a significant mediator (P = 1.9Ã 10-4) in the association between the locus and CRP, explaining 30% of the mediation. The locus was near ATG5, encoding an autophagy molecule reported to modulate adipocyte size and macrophage polarization.              Conclusion:                    A genetic locus near ATG5 regulates preferential accumulation of VF (vs SF) in youth and adulthood and contributes to the development of systemic inflammation in adulthood.",-1
Human endogenous retrovirus K in the respiratory tract is associated with COVID-19 physiopathology,"Background:                    Critically ill 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are 10 to 40 times more likely to die than the general population. Although progression from mild to severe COVID-19 has been associated with hypoxia, uncontrolled inflammation, and coagulopathy, the mechanisms involved in the progression to severity are poorly understood.              Methods:                    The virome of tracheal aspirates (TA) from 25 COVID-19 patients under IMV was assessed through unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and correlation analyses were conducted using available clinical data. Unbiased sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) from mild cases and TA from non-COVID patients were included in our study for further comparisons.              Results:                    We found higher levels and differential expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) genes in TA from critically ill and deceased patients when comparing nasopharyngeal swabs from mild cases to TA from non-COVID patients. In critically ill patients, higher HERV-K levels were associated with early mortality (within 14 days of diagnosis) in the intensive care unit. Increased HERV-K expression in deceased patients was associated with IL-17-related inflammation, monocyte activation, and an increased consumption of clotting/fibrinolysis factors. Moreover, increased HERV-K expression was detected in human primary monocytes from healthy donors after experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.              Conclusion:                    Our data implicate the levels of HERV-K transcripts in the physiopathology of COVID-19 in the respiratory tract of patients under invasive mechanical ventilation.

"Preparation, characterisation and comparative toxicity of nanopermethrin against Anopheles stephensi and Culex pipiens","Objectives:                    To assess the effectiveness of nanopermethrin as a potential new formulation for pest and vector control.              Methods:                    Permethrin nanoparticles were prepared by the ionic gelation method and its structure and the formulations were designed using Box-Behnken statistical technique. The effect of independent variables (Chitosan/Permethrin ratio, tripolyphosphate quantity, sonication time) on the properties of nanoparticles was investigated to determine the optimal formulation.              Results:                    The size of the nanoparticles ranged from 135.27 Â± 5.88 to 539.5 Â± 24.01 nm and the insecticide entrapment efficiency per cent (EE%) ranged from 7.72 Â± 1.36 to 63.59 Â± 3.17%. Anopheles stephensi larvae were then bioassayed with the nanopermethrin and compared with the results of the bioassay with the mother molecule of permethrin using a standard WHO-recommended mosquito larval bioassay kit. LC50 with permethrin and nanopermethrin on larvae of An. stephensi were 0.125 and 0.026 ppm showing a 4.8 times difference. The LC50 for permethrin and nanopermethrin on Culex pipiens were 0.003 and 0.00032 ppm, respectively, showing a 9.4-fold difference.              Conclusion:                    Nanopermethrin is much more potent than its mother molecule against larvae of An. stephensi and Cx. pipiens.",-1
Graph Theory on Brain Cortical Sources in Parkinson's Disease: The Analysis of 'Small World' Organization from EEG,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly population. Similarly to other neurodegenerative diseases, the early diagnosis of PD is quite difficult. The current pilot study aimed to explore the differences in brain connectivity between PD and NOrmal eLDerly (Nold) subjects to evaluate whether connectivity analysis may speed up and support early diagnosis. A total of 26 resting state EEGs were analyzed from 13 PD patients and 13 age-matched Nold subjects, applying to cortical reconstructions the graph theory analyses, a mathematical representation of brain architecture. Results showed that PD patients presented a more ordered structure at slow-frequency EEG rhythms (lower value of SW) than Nold subjects, particularly in the theta band, whereas in the high-frequency alpha, PD patients presented more random organization (higher SW) than Nold subjects. The current results suggest that PD could globally modulate the cortical connectivity of the brain, modifying the functional network organization and resulting in motor and non-motor signs. Future studies could validate whether such an approach, based on a low-cost and non-invasive technique, could be useful for early diagnosis, for the follow-up of PD progression, as well as for evaluating pharmacological and neurorehabilitation treatments.",-1
Intermittent Fasting Enhanced the Cognitive Function in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment by Inducing Biochemical and Metabolic changes: A 3-Year Progressive Study,"Intermittent fasting (IF) refers to various dietary regimens that cycle between a period of non-fasting and a period of total fasting. This study aimed to determine the effects of IF on cognitive function among elderly individuals who practice IF who have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 99 elderly subjects with MCI of Malay ethnicity without any terminal illness were recruited from a larger cohort study, LRGS TUA. The subjects were divided into three groups, comprising those who were regularly practicing IF (r-IF), irregularly practicing IF (i-IF), and non-fasters (n-IF). Upon 36 months of follow-up, more MCI subjects in the r-IF group reverted to successful aging with no cognitive impairment and diseases (24.3%) compared to those in i-IF (14.2%) and n-IF groups (3.7%). The r-IF group's subjects exhibited significant increment in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduction in body weight, levels of insulin, fasting blood glucose, malondialdehyde (MDA), C-reactive protein (CRP), and DNA damage. Moreover, metabolomics analysis showed that IF may modulate cognitive function via various metabolite pathways, including the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, butanoate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways. Overall, the MCI-afflicted older adults who practiced IF regularly had better cognitive scores and reverted to better cognitive function at 36 months follow-up.",-1
Analyzing historical and future acute neurosurgical demand using an AI-enabled predictive dashboard,"Characterizing acute service demand is critical for neurosurgery and other emergency-dominant specialties in order to dynamically distribute resources and ensure timely access to treatment. This is especially important in the post-Covid 19 pandemic period, when healthcare centers are grappling with a record backlog of pending surgical procedures and rising acute referral numbers. Healthcare dashboards are well-placed to analyze this data, making key information about service and clinical outcomes available to staff in an easy-to-understand format. However, they typically provide insights based on inference rather than prediction, limiting their operational utility. We retrospectively analyzed and prospectively forecasted acute neurosurgical referrals, based on 10,033 referrals made to a large volume tertiary neurosciences center in London, U.K., from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown period until October 2021 through the use of a novel AI-enabled predictive dashboard. As anticipated, weekly referral volumes significantly increased during this period, largely owing to an increase in spinal referrals (p < 0.05). Applying validated time-series forecasting methods, we found that referrals were projected to increase beyond this time-point, with Prophet demonstrating the best test and computational performance. Using a mixed-methods approach, we determined that a dashboard approach was usable, feasible, and acceptable among key stakeholders.",-1
Association Between Regional Adipose Tissue Distribution and Risk of Heart Failure Among Blacks,"Background:                    Obesity is highly prevalent among blacks and is associated with a greater risk of heart failure (HF). However, the contribution of regional adiposity depots such as visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue toward risk of HF in blacks is unknown.              Methods and results:                    We included 2602 participants (mean age: 59 years, 35% men) from the Jackson Heart Study without prevalent HF who underwent computed tomography quantification of VAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue during the second visit (2005-2009). The associations between different adiposity measures and HF were evaluated using adjusted Cox models. There were 122 incident HF events over a median follow-up of 7.1 years. Higher amounts of VAT were associated with greater risk of HF in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio [95% CI] per 1-SD higher VAT: 1.29 [1.09-1.52]). This association was attenuated and not significant after additional adjustment for traditional HF risk factors and body mass index. Overall obesity, represented by body mass index, was associated with higher risk of HF independent of risk factors and VAT (hazard ratio [95% CI] per 1-kg/m2 higher body mass index: 1.06 [1.02-1.11]). Subcutaneous adipose tissue was not associated with risk of HF in adjusted analyses.              Conclusions:                    In a community-dwelling black population, higher amounts of overall and visceral adiposity are associated with higher risk of HF. The association between VAT and HF risk in blacks may reflect differences in traditional HF risk factor burden. Future studies are needed to confirm this observation and clarify the independent role of different measures of adiposity on HF outcomes.",-1
The central melanocortin system mediates the benefits of time-restricted feeding on energy balance,"Objective:                    Recent decades have seen a marked increase in the prevalence of obesity and its associated comorbidities. This increase correlates with greater access to calorie-dense food that is often consumed later in the active phase of the day. Studies in high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice indicate that restricting food access to their active (dark) phase is sufficient to reduce obesity. However, the specific mechanisms mediating these beneficial metabolic effects of dark restricted feeding (DRF) remain unknown.              Methods:                    We examined the impact of DRF on the response to peripheral signals regulating the central melanocortin system of DIO mice and on Mc4r-/- mice.              Results:                    The body weight loss following DRF has an acute onset that is sustained over time. This effect is contributed by a reduction on food intake that requires a functional central melanocortin system. Specifically, DRF impacts the circadian expression of melanocortin system genes in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). Consistent with this, DRF significantly increases the effectiveness of the fasting-feeding signals ghrelin and leptin that interact with the melanocortin system to regulate energy balance. Importantly, DRF did not reduce or prevent obesity in Mc4r-/- mice.              Conclusions:                    Taken together, our data reveal a critical role of brain melanocortin signaling in mediating the beneficial effects of timed feeding on metabolic control, supporting potential meaningful benefits in combining timed feeding with pharmacological targeting of the melanocortin signaling for the treatment of obesity.",-1
"Sgt1 Regulates Î±-Synuclein Subcellular Localization and Expression of Parkinson's Disease Related Genes, PINK1 and PARK9","The SGT1 protein is highly expressed in the mammalian brain, particularly in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex, and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. There are literature data indicating that the protein may be involved in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present work we have found that SGT1 protected cells from the toxicity of rotenone, an agent that evokes behavioral and histopathological symptoms of PD. To gain more insight into the possible mechanism underlying the protective action of SGT1 we looked at Î±-synuclein subcellular distribution in HEK293 cells with an altered SGT1 level. By immunofluorescent staining we have found that in HEK293 cells overexpressing SGT1 Î±-synuclein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm while in control cells it was present in the nucleus. Accordingly, when SGT1 expression was silenced, Î±-synuclein was predominantly present in the nucleus. These results were then confirmed by subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis. Moreover, we have found that altered level of SGT1 in HEK293 cells influenced the expression of PD related genes, PINK1 and PARK9. Altogether, our results point to SGT1 as an important factor that might be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).",-1
Alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolome profiles of septic rats treated with aminophylline,"The treatment of sepsis remains a major challenge worldwide. Aminophylline has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects; however, the role of aminophylline in sepsis, a disease characterized by immune dysregulation, is unknown. In this study, we combined microbiome sequencing and metabolomic assays to investigate the effect of aminophylline administration on the intestinal flora and metabolites in septic rats. Sixty SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: a sham-operated (SC) group, a sepsis model (CLP) group and a CLP + aminophylline treatment (Amino) group. The intestinal flora and metabolic profile of rats in the CLP group were significantly different than those of the SC group, while aminophylline administration resulted in a return to a state similar to healthy rats. Differential abundance analysis showed that aminophylline significantly back-regulated the abundance of Firmicutes, unidentified_Bacteria, Proteobacteria, Lactobacillus, Escherichia-Shigella and other dominant bacteria (P < 0.05) and altered chenodeoxycholic acid, isolithocholic acid and a total of 26 metabolites (variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 1, P < 0.05). In addition, we found that there were significant correlations between differential metabolites and bacterial genera of the Amino and CLP groups. For example, Escherichia-Shigella was associated with 12 metabolites, and Lactobacillus was associated with two metabolites (P < 0.05), suggesting that differences in the metabolic profiles caused by aminophylline were partly dependent on its influence on the gutmicrobiome. In conclusion, this study identified a novel protective mechanism whereby aminophylline could regulate disordered intestinal flora and metabolites in septic rats.",-1
Sesquiterpene glycoside isolated from loquat leaf targets gut microbiota to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus in db/db mice,"According to ancient records, loquat leaf has been used as both a food and medicine in China for thousands of years. Sesquiterpene glycosides from loquat leaf have achieved remarkable effects on hyperglycemia. However, their specific activities and underlying mechanisms on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not fully understood. In the present study, we found that SG1, a unique sesquiterpene glycoside isolated from loquat leaf, had the capability to prevent insulin resistance and inflammation. In db/db mice, SG1 administration (25 and 50 mg kg-1 day-1) inhibited hyperglycemia and the release of inflammatory cytokines. To further explore the possible role of gut microbiota in SG1 for treating T2DM, we applied 16S rRNA pyrosequencing based on the V3-V4 region to analyze the fecal samples of different groups. Alpha diversity analysis showed that SG1 administration could obviously increase diversity and richness in db/db mice. At the phylum level, due to SG1 treatment, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria was lowered while that of Bacteroidetes was raised. Additionally, 7 key genera in the db/db mice with SG1 supplementation were enriched: Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, and Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, Alistipes, and Roseburia. These findings proved that SG1 could prevent T2DM by relieving insulin resistance and inflammation and by remodeling the gut microbiota in db/db mice.",-1
The effects of exercise on kidney injury: the role of SIRT1,"In patients with kidney injury, muscle mass and strength decrease with altered muscle protein synthesis and degradation along with complications such as inflammation and low physical activity. A treatment strategy to maintain muscle metabolism in kidney injury is important. One of the proposed strategies in this regard is exercise, which in addition to inducing muscle hypertrophy, reducing plasma creatinine and urea and decreasing the severity of tubal injuries, can boost immune function and has anti-inflammatory effects. One of the molecules that have been considered as a target in the treatment of many diseases is silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1). Exercise increases the expression of SIRT1 and improves its activity. Therefore, studies that examined the effect of exercise on kidney injury considering the role of SIRT1 in this effect were reviewed to determine the direction of kidney injury research in future regarding to its prevalence, especially following diabetes, and lack of definitive treatment. In this review, we found that SIRT1 can be one of renoprotective target pathways of exercise. However, further studies are needed to determine the role of SIRT1 in different kidney injuries following exercise according to the type and severity of exercise, and the type of kidney injury.",-1
"It's the data, stupid: Inflection point for Artificial Intelligence in Indian healthcare","Indian healthcare is fast growing and with significant chunk of it being in small, fragmented, informal sector; Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pegged as a magical tool for a better healthcare system. There is an inclination to merely mimic the US approach in the on-going policy making and legislative exercises, which can have serious fallouts for Indian healthcare. India needs a different approach to suite her unique requirements. In this regard, each of the five stages in AI development lifecycle has been analyzed in the light of current on-ground realities. These boil down to three fold challenges of how to increase adoption of digital health, prevent data silos and create maximum value from data. Availability of quality data for value addition without barriers and restrictions is the common denominator for leveraging the full potential of AI. This requires liberal policies enabling secondary use of data in developing countries with rapidly growing healthcare sector akin to India. This has to be carefully balanced with data privacy and security. Restrictive healthcare data policies and laws can slow down adoption of digitization, perpetuate status-quo, be biased towards the incumbent players, cause Industry stagnation and thus will do more harm than good. It is therefore the data policies that will make or break AI in Indian healthcare.",-1
Detection of Systemic Diseases From Ocular Images Using Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Review,"Purpose:                    Despite the huge investment in health care, there is still a lack of precise and easily accessible screening systems. With proven associations to many systemic diseases, the eye could potentially provide a credible perspective as a novel screening tool. This systematic review aims to summarize the current applications of ocular image-based artificial intelligence on the detection of systemic diseases and suggest future trends for systemic disease screening.              Methods:                    A systematic search was conducted on September 1, 2021, using 3 databases-PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science library. Date restrictions were not imposed and search terms covering ocular images, systemic diseases, and artificial intelligence aspects were used.              Results:                    Thirty-three papers were included in this systematic review. A spectrum of target diseases was observed, and this included but was not limited to cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, central nervous system diseases, renal dysfunctions, and hepatological diseases. Additionally, one- third of the papers included risk factor predictions for the respective systemic diseases.              Conclusions:                    Ocular image - based artificial intelligence possesses potential diagnostic power to screen various systemic diseases and has also demonstrated the ability to detect Alzheimer and chronic kidney diseases at early stages. Further research is needed to validate these models for real-world implementation.",-1
Data-driven identification of diagnostically useful extrastriatal signal in dopamine transporter SPECT using explainable AI,"This study used explainable artificial intelligence for data-driven identification of extrastriatal brain regions that can contribute to the interpretation of dopamine transporter SPECT with 123I-FP-CIT in parkinsonian syndromes. A total of 1306 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT were included retrospectively. Binary classification as 'reduced' or 'normal' striatal 123I-FP-CIT uptake by an experienced reader served as standard-of-truth. A custom-made 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained for classification of the SPECT images with 1006 randomly selected images in three different settings: ""full image"", ""striatum only"" (3-dimensional region covering the striata cropped from the full image), ""without striatum"" (full image with striatal region removed). The remaining 300 SPECT images were used to test the CNN classification performance. Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) was used for voxelwise quantification of the relevance for the CNN-based classification in this test set. Overall accuracy of CNN-based classification was 97.0%, 95.7%, and 69.3% in the ""full image"", ""striatum only"", and ""without striatum"" setting. Prominent contributions in the LRP-based relevance maps beyond the striatal signal were detected in insula, amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, thalamus, anterior temporal cortex, superior frontal lobe, and pons, suggesting that 123I-FP-CIT uptake in these brain regions provides clinically useful information for the differentiation of neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes.",-1
Glucose-lowering agents for treating pre-existing and new-onset diabetes in kidney transplant recipients,"Background:                    Kidney transplantation is the preferred management for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, it is often complicated by worsening or new-onset diabetes. The safety and efficacy of glucose-lowering agents after kidney transplantation is largely unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2017.              Objectives:                    To evaluate the efficacy and safety of glucose-lowering agents for treating pre-existing and new onset diabetes in people who have undergone kidney transplantation.              Search methods:                    We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 16 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.              Selection criteria:                    All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies examining head-to-head comparisons of active regimens of glucose-lowering therapy or active regimen compared with placebo/standard care in patients who have received a kidney transplant and have diabetes were eligible for inclusion.              Data collection and analysis:                    Four authors independently assessed study eligibility and quality and performed data extraction. Continuous outcomes were expressed as post-treatment mean differences (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD). Adverse events were expressed as post-treatment absolute risk differences (RD). Dichotomous clinical outcomes were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).              Main results:                    Ten studies (21 records, 603 randomised participants) were included - three additional studies (five records) since our last review. Four studies compared more intensive versus less intensive insulin therapy; two studies compared dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors to placebo; one study compared DPP-4 inhibitors to insulin glargine; one study compared sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors to placebo; and two studies compared glitazones and insulin to insulin therapy alone. The majority of studies had an unclear to a high risk of bias. There were no studies examining the effects of biguanides, glinides, GLP-1 agonists, or sulphonylureas. Compared to less intensive insulin therapy, it is unclear if more intensive insulin therapy has an effect on transplant or graft survival (4 studies, 301 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.94; I2 = 49%; very low certainty evidence), delayed graft function (2 studies, 153 participants: RR 0.63, 0.42 to 0.93; I2 = 0%; very low certainty evidence), HbA1c (1 study, 16 participants; very low certainty evidence), fasting blood glucose (1 study, 24 participants; very low certainty evidence), kidney function markers (1 study, 26 participants; very low certainty evidence), death (any cause) (3 studies, 208 participants"" RR 0.68, 0.29 to 1.58; I2 = 0%; very low certainty evidence), hypoglycaemia (4 studies, 301 participants; very low certainty evidence) and medication discontinuation due to adverse effects (1 study, 60 participants; very low certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, it is unclear whether DPP-4 inhibitors have an effect on hypoglycaemia and medication discontinuation (2 studies, 51 participants; very low certainty evidence). However, DPP-4 inhibitors may reduce HbA1c and fasting blood glucose but not kidney function markers (1 study, 32 participants; low certainty evidence). Compared to insulin glargine, it is unclear if DPP-4 inhibitors have an effect on HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, hypoglycaemia or discontinuation due to adverse events (1 study, 45 participants; very low certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors probably do not affect kidney graft survival (1 study, 44 participants; moderate certainty evidence), but may reduce HbA1c without affecting fasting blood glucose and eGFR long-term (1 study, 44 participants, low certainty evidence). SGLT2 inhibitors probably do not increase hypoglycaemia, and probably have little or no effect on medication discontinuation due to adverse events. However, all participants discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors had urinary tract infections (1 study, 44 participants, moderate certainty evidence). Compared to insulin therapy alone, it is unclear if glitazones added to insulin have an effect on HbA1c or kidney function markers (1 study, 62 participants; very low certainty evidence). However, glitazones may make little or no difference to fasting blood glucose (2 studies, 120 participants; low certainty evidence), and medication discontinuation due to adverse events (1 study, 62 participants; low certainty evidence). No studies of DPP-4 inhibitors, or glitazones reported effects on transplant or graft survival, delayed graft function or death (any cause).              Authors' conclusions:                    The efficacy and safety of glucose-lowering agents in the treatment of pre-existing and new-onset diabetes in kidney transplant recipients is questionable. Evidence from existing studies examining the effect of intensive insulin therapy, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT inhibitors and glitazones is mostly of low to very low certainty. Appropriately blinded, larger, and higher quality RCTs are needed to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of contemporary glucose-lowering agents in the kidney transplant population.",-1
Neutrophil Functional Heterogeneity and Implications for Viral Infections and Treatments,"Evidence suggests that neutrophils exert specialized effector functions during infection and inflammation, and that these cells can affect the duration, severity, and outcome of the infection. These functions are related to variations in phenotypes that have implications in immunoregulation during viral infections. Although the complexity of the heterogeneity of neutrophils is still in the process of being uncovered, evidence indicates that they display phenotypes and functions that can assist in viral clearance or augment and amplify the immunopathology of viruses. Therefore, deciphering and understanding neutrophil subsets and their polarization in viral infections is of importance. In this review, the different phenotypes of neutrophils and the roles they play in viral infections are discussed. We also examine the possible ways to target neutrophil subsets during viral infections as potential anti-viral treatments.",-1
Design and Implementation of Tourism Teaching System Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology,"The tourism teaching system provides all kinds of teaching resources for students and shares good teachers, which greatly improves the quality of teaching and learning, and it enables students to teach and learn randomly in the system. The mode of educational information dissemination has also changed, resulting in great changes in educational models, ideas, and methods. The tourism teaching system overcomes the shortcomings of traditional education. In the 21st century, the means of education and teaching will be ITS-based, and technology will be used to optimize teaching. With the rapid development of network technology, it has been widely used in the field of education, and the way of educational information dissemination has also changed, which has led to great changes in educational models, concepts, and methods. Therefore, the combination of artificial intelligence technology and tourism teaching system is the focus of current educational research. In this paper, the tourism teaching system is designed based on artificial intelligence technology. Combined with the application status of the tourism teaching system in education, a personalized cognitive student model is designed by combining artificial intelligence technology with student behavior analysis, and an intelligent and personalized educational environment is developed. Design and implement a simple web-based tourism teaching system, use a personalized cognitive student model to model students, and use an expert question bank and self-built question bank to test students' learning to provide a basis for students' next learning.",-1
Computer-Aided Detection of Quantitative Signatures for Breast Fibroepithelial Tumors Using Label-Free Multi-Photon Imaging,"Fibroadenomas (FAs) and phyllodes tumors (PTs) are major benign breast tumors, pathologically classified as fibroepithelial tumors. Although the clinical management of PTs differs from FAs, distinction by core needle biopsy diagnoses is still challenging. Here, a combined technique of label-free imaging with multi-photon microscopy and artificial intelligence was applied to detect quantitative signatures that differentiate fibroepithelial lesions. Multi-photon excited autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG) signals were detected in tissue sections. A pixel-wise semantic segmentation method using a deep learning framework was used to separate epithelial and stromal regions automatically. The epithelial to stromal area ratio and the collagen SHG signal strength were investigated for their ability to distinguish fibroepithelial lesions. An image segmentation analysis with a pixel-wise semantic segmentation framework using a deep convolutional neural network showed the accurate separation of epithelial and stromal regions. A further investigation, to determine if scoring the epithelial to stromal area ratio and the SHG signal strength within the stromal area could be a marker for differentiating fibroepithelial tumors, showed accurate classification. Therefore, molecular and morphological changes, detected through the assistance of computational and label-free multi-photon imaging techniques, enable us to propose quantitative signatures for epithelial and stromal alterations in breast tissues.",-1
Morphology and fracture behavior of lithium disilicate dental crowns designed by human and knowledge-based AI,"This study aimed to compare the occlusal morphology and fracture behavior of lithium disilicate ceramic dental crowns on 12 human participants' premolar #45 designed by a knowledge-based AI (CEREC, biogeneric individual function, BI) and different human personnel (experienced technician, TD, and trained dental students, AD) using CAD software. Digital datasets of crown design were best-fit aligned with the original teeth to evaluate profile and volume discrepancies of the occlusal morphology, and difference in the functional cuspal angle. Milled and sintered lithium disilicate crowns were resin-luted to 3D-printed dental casts and were subjected to axial load-to-fracture test. The fracture loads and failure modes were recorded and examined. Repeated measures ANOVA with LSD post-hoc test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, paired t-test, and chi-square exact test were used for statistical analyses (Î± = 0.05). BI-generated crowns showed the highest occlusal profile discrepancy (0.3677 Â± 0.0388 mm), whereas human-CAD designed crowns showed higher conformity to the original teeth (0.3254 Â± 0.0515 mm for TD, 0.3571 Â± 0.0820 for AD; z-difference method; p < 0.001). Cusp angle values were significantly different in all groups except BI and TD (54.76 Â± 3.81Â° for the original teeth, 70.84 Â± 4.31Â° for BI, 67.45 Â± 5.30Â° for TD, and 62.30 Â± 7.92Â° for AD; p < 0.001). Although all three groups of crown designs could achieve clinically acceptable fracture resistance (1556.09 Â± 525.68 N for BI, 1486.00 Â± 520.08 N for TD, 1425.77 Â± 433.34 for AD; p = 0.505) such that no significant difference in fracture strength was found, most crowns presented catastrophic bulk fracture that was not clinically restorable because of the substrate fracture. Group BI had a significantly higher percentage of restorable substrate damage than TD (p = 0.014) and AD (p < 0.001). In conclusion, in designing lithium disilicate dental crown, CAD design with human may be better than knowledge-based AI.",-1
"A Markerless 2D Video, Facial Feature Recognition-Based, Artificial Intelligence Model to Assist With Screening for Parkinson Disease: Development and Usability Study","Background:                    Masked face is a characteristic clinical manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD), but subjective evaluations from different clinicians often show low consistency owing to a lack of accurate detection technology. Hence, it is of great significance to develop methods to make monitoring easier and more accessible.              Objective:                    The study aimed to develop a markerless 2D video, facial feature recognition-based, artificial intelligence (AI) model to assess facial features of PD patients and investigate how AI could help neurologists improve the performance of early PD diagnosis.              Methods:                    We collected 140 videos of facial expressions from 70 PD patients and 70 matched controls from 3 hospitals using a single 2D video camera. We developed and tested an AI model that performs masked face recognition of PD patients based on the acquisition and evaluation of facial features including geometric and texture features. Random forest, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbor were used to train the model. The diagnostic performance of the AI model was compared with that of 5 neurologists.              Results:                    The experimental results showed that our AI models can achieve feasible and effective facial feature recognition ability to assist with PD diagnosis. The accuracy of PD diagnosis can reach 83% using geometric features. And with the model trained by random forest, the accuracy of texture features is up to 86%. When these 2 features are combined, an F1 value of 88% can be reached, where the random forest algorithm is used. Further, the facial features of patients with PD were not associated with the motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD.              Conclusions:                    PD patients commonly exhibit masked facial features. Videos of a facial feature recognition-based AI model can provide a valuable tool to assist with PD diagnosis and the potential of realizing remote monitoring of the patient's condition, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",-1
Analysis of Logistics Linkage by Digital Twins Technology and Lightweight Deep Learning,"The present work expects to meet the personalized needs of the continuous development of various products and improve the joint operation of the intraenterprise Production and Distribution (P-D) process. Specifically, this paper studies the enterprise's P-D optimization. Firstly, the P-D linkage operation is analyzed under dynamic interference. Secondly, following a literature review on the difficulties and problems existing in the current P-D logistics linkage, the P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making information architecture is established based on Digital Twins. Digital Twins technology is mainly used to accurately map the P-D logistics linkage process's real-time data and dynamic virtual simulation. In addition, the information support foundation is constructed for P-D logistics linkage decision-making and collaborative operation. Thirdly, a Digital Twins-enabled P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making mechanism is designed and verified under the dynamic interference in the linkage process. Meanwhile, the lightweight deep learning algorithm is used to optimize the proposed P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making model, namely, the Collaborative Optimization (CO) method. Finally, the proposed P-D logistics linkage-oriented decision-making model is applied to a domestic Enterprise H. It is simulated by the Matlab platform using sensitivity analysis. The results show that the production, storage, distribution, punishment, and total costs of linkage operation are 24,943 RMB, 3,393 RMB, 2,167 RMB, 0 RMB, and 30,503 RMB, respectively. The results are 3.7% lower than the nonlinkage operation. The results of sensitivity analysis provide a high reference value for the scientific management of enterprises.",-1
Advances and opportunities in malaria population genomics,"Almost 20 years have passed since the first reference genome assemblies were published for Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite, and Anopheles gambiae, the most important mosquito vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Reference genomes now exist for all human malaria parasites and nearly half of the ~40 important vectors around the world. As a foundation for genetic diversity studies, these reference genomes have helped advance our understanding of basic disease biology and drug and insecticide resistance, and have informed vaccine development efforts. Population genomic data are increasingly being used to guide our understanding of malaria epidemiology, for example by assessing connectivity between populations and the efficacy of parasite and vector interventions. The potential value of these applications to malaria control strategies, together with the increasing diversity of genomic data types and contexts in which data are being generated, raise both opportunities and challenges in the field. This Review discusses advances in malaria genomics and explores how population genomic data could be harnessed to further support global disease control efforts.",-1
Mitochondria-Endoplasmic Reticulum Contacts: The Promising Regulators in Diabetic Cardiomyopathy,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), as a serious complication of diabetes, causes structural and functional abnormalities of the heart and eventually progresses to heart failure. Currently, there is no specific treatment for DCM. Studies have proved that mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are key factors for the development and progression of DCM. The mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are a unique domain formed by physical contacts between mitochondria and ER and mediate organelle communication. Under high glucose conditions, changes in the distance and composition of MAMs lead to abnormal intracellular signal transduction, which will affect the physiological function of MAMs, such as alter the Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes, and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal apoptosis. Therefore, the dysfunction of MAMs is closely related to the pathogenesis of DCM. In this review, we summarized the evidence for the role of MAMs in DCM and described that MAMs participated directly or indirectly in the regulation of the pathophysiological process of DCM via the regulation of Ca2+ signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, ER stress, autophagy, and inflammation. Finally, we discussed the clinical transformation prospects and technical limitations of MAMs-associated proteins (such as MFN2, FUNDC1, and GSK3Î²) as potential therapeutic targets for DCM.",-1
Involvement of GABAergic interneuron dysfunction and neuronal network hyperexcitability in Alzheimer's disease: Amelioration by metabolic switching,"Evidence accumulated over the past three decades suggests that the neurons that degenerate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suffer metabolic compromise, hyperexcitability and consequent calcium ion (Ca2+) overload-mediated dysfunction and death. Contributing to the neuronal network hyperexcitability in AD is the degeneration of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, apparently as a result of their unusually high firing frequency and metabolic demand. Aging, genetic factors, and unhealthy lifestyles including lack of exercise and overconsumption of calorie-rich foods may compromise the ability of neurons to sustain mitochondrial function and to remove damaged molecules. Here I briefly review evidence supporting a role for early GABAergic neuron degeneration and consequent neuronal network hyperexcitability in AD. I then highlight data suggesting pivotal roles for ketones, NAD+ and the mitochondrial protein deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) in protecting against hyperexcitability in AD.",-1
Adipose Tissue Distribution and Survival Among Women with Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer,"Objective:                    Previous studies of breast cancer survival have not considered specific depots of adipose tissue such as subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT).              Methods:                    This study assessed these relationships among 3,235 women with stage II and III breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2013 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and between 2000 and 2012 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. SAT and VAT areas (in centimeters squared) were calculated from routine computed tomography scans within 6 (median: 1.2) months of diagnosis, covariates were collected from electronic health records, and vital status was assessed by death records. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox regression.              Results:                    SAT and VAT ranged from 19.0 to 891 cm2 and from 0.484 to 454 cm2 , respectively. SAT was related to increased risk of death (127-cm2 increase; HR [95% CI]: 1.13 [1.02-1.26]), but no relationship was found with VAT (78.18-cm2 increase; HR [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.91-1.14]). An association with VAT was noted among women with stage II cancer (stage II: HR: 1.17 [95% CI: 0.99-1.39]; stage III: HR: 0.90 [95% CI: 0.76-1.07]; P interaction < 0.01). Joint increases in SAT and VAT were associated with mortality above either alone (simultaneous 1-SD increase: HR 1.19 [95% CI: 1.05-1.34]).              Conclusions:                    SAT may be an underappreciated risk factor for breast cancer-related death.",-1
"Climatic and socio-economic factors supporting the co-circulation of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in three different ecosystems in Colombia","Dengue, Zika and chikungunya are diseases of global health significance caused by arboviruses and transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is of worldwide circulation. The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, CÃºcuta and MoniquirÃ¡). These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature, minimum temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in CÃºcuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to CÃºcuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable local knowledge base. This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control efforts.",-1
The Molecular Neuroimaging of Tremor,"Purpose of review:                    Tremor is a hyperkinetic movement disorder most commonly encountered in essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of this review is to summarize molecular neuroimaging studies with major implications on pathophysiological and clinical features of tremor.              Recent findings:                    Oscillatory brain activity responsible for tremor manifestation is thought to originate in a cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. Molecular neuroimaging has helped clarify metabolic aspects and neurotransmitter influences on the main tremor network. In ET, recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies are built on previous knowledge and highlighted the possibility of investigating metabolic brain changes after treatments, in the attempt to establish therapeutic biomarkers. In PD, molecular neuroimaging has advanced the knowledge of non-dopaminergic determinants of tremor, providing insights into serotonergic and noradrenergic contributions. Recent advances have greatly extended the knowledge of tremor pathophysiology and it is now necessary to translate such knowledge in more efficacious treatments for this symptom.",-1
Increased Diet Quality is Associated with Long-Term Reduction of Abdominal and Pericardial Fat,"Objective:                    This study examined the longitudinal associations between genetic risk, change in diet quality, and change in visceral adipose tissue (ÎVAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ÎSAT), and pericardial adipose tissue (ÎPAT).              Methods:                    A total of 1,677 Framingham Heart Study participants who had ectopic fat depots measured using computed tomography were analyzed. Diet quality was quantified using a Mediterranean-style diet score (MDS) and genetic risk by depot-specific genetic risk scores (GRSs).              Results:                    Per SD improvement in MDS, there was 50 cm3 (95% CI: 14-86; P = 0.007) less fat accumulation in VAT, 52 cm3 (95% CI: 12-92; P = 0.01) less fat accumulation in SAT, and 1.3 cm3 (95% CI: 0.1-2.4; P = 0.04) less fat accumulation in PAT. No association was observed between GRSs and ÎVAT or ÎSAT. Each 1-SD increase in the PAT GRS was associated with a 1.2-cm3 (95% CI: 0.1-2.3; P = 0.03) increase in ÎPAT. In participants with higher PAT GRS, those with ÎMDS â?0 had a favorable change in PAT compared with the counterparts with ÎMDS < 0 (P = 0.008).              Conclusions:                    Longitudinal improvements in diet quality are associated with less ectopic fat accumulation. This study suggests that diet quality may play a critical role in improving ectopic adiposity profiles.",-1
Long-Term Glycemic Variability and Vascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes: Post Hoc Analysis of the FIELD Study,"Aims:                    To investigate whether long-term glycemic variability (GV) is associated with vascular complication development in type 2 diabetes.              Methods:                    In a post hoc FIELD trial analysis, GV was calculated as the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose. Baseline variables were compared across quartiles of on-study variability by chi square and ANOVA. Prospective associations between baseline to 2-year GV and subsequent vascular and mortality outcomes were analyzed using landmark logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression.              Results:                    Baseline factors associated with higher on-study GV included younger age, male gender, longer diabetes duration, and higher pharmacological therapies usage. Both HbA1c and fasting glucose CV were associated with increased risk of microvascular complications (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.03] P < 0.01; and HR 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.01] P < 0.001, respectively). HbA1c and fasting glucose CV were associated with increased cardiovascular disease (HR 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00-1.04]; and HR 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.02], both P < 0.05). HbA1c CV associated with increased stroke (HR 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.06) P < 0.01). Glucose CV associated with increased coronary events (HR 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.02] P < 0.05). Both HbA1c and glucose CV associated with increased total mortality (HR 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.06]; and HR 1.01 [95% CI, 1.01-1.02], both P < 0.001) and noncardiovascular mortality (HR 1.05 [95% CI, (1.03-1.07]; and HR 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.03], both P < 0.001). HbA1c CV associated with coronary mortality (HR 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07] P < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Long-term GV was associated with increased risk of vascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes.",-1
Bicyclol Alleviates Atherosclerosis by Manipulating Gut Microbiota,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, thus imposing a growing burden on modern society. Herb-derived bicyclol (BIC) is a versatile bioactive compound that can be used to treat AS. However, its efficacy in AS is not yet described. Here, it is shown that BIC normalizes gut microflora dysbiosis induced by a high fat diet in Apoe(-/-) mice. Metagenome-wide association study analysis verifies that the modulation on carbohydrate-active enzymes and short-chain fatty acid generating genes in gut flora is among the mechanisms. The gut healthiness, especially the gut immunity and integrity, is restored by BIC intervention, leading to improved systemic immune cell dynamic and liver functions. Accordingly, the endothelial activation, macrophage infiltration, and cholesterol ester accumulation in the aortic arch are alleviated by BIC to lessen the plaque onset. Moreover, it is proved that the therapeutic effect of BIC on AS is transmissible by fecal microbiota transplantation. The current study, for the first time, demonstrates the antiatherosclerotic effects of BIC and shows that its therapeutic value can at least partially be attributed to its manipulation of gut microbiota.",-1
Incorporating plasmonic featurization with machine learning to achieve accurate and bidirectional prediction of nanoparticle size and size distribution,"Determination of nanoparticle size and size distribution is important because these key parameters dictate nanomaterials' properties and applications. Yet, it is only accomplishable using low-throughput electron microscopy. Herein, we incorporate plasmonic-domain-driven feature engineering with machine learning (ML) for accurate and bidirectional prediction of both parameters for complete characterization of nanoparticle ensembles. Using gold nanospheres as our model system, our ML approach achieves the lowest prediction errors of 2.3% and Â±1.0 nm for ensemble size and size distribution respectively, which is 3-6 times lower than previously reported ML or Mie approaches. Knowledge elicitation from the plasmonic domain and concomitant translation into featurization allow us to mitigate noise and boost data interpretability. This enables us to overcome challenges arising from size anisotropy and small sample size limitations to achieve highly generalizable ML models. We further showcase inverse prediction capabilities, using size and size distribution as inputs to generate spectra with LSPRs that closely match experimental data. This work illustrates a ML-empowered total nanocharacterization strategy that is rapid (<30 s), versatile, and applicable over a wide size range of 200 nm.",-1
Fungal commensalism modulated by a dual-action phosphate transceptor,"Successful host colonization by fungi in fluctuating niches requires response and adaptation to multiple environmental stresses. However, our understanding about how fungal species thrive in the gastrointestinal (GI) ecosystem by combing multifaceted nutritional stress with respect to homeostatic host-commensal interactions is still in its infancy. Here, we discover that depletion of the phosphate transceptor Pho84 across multiple fungal species encountered a substantial cost in gastrointestinal colonization. Mechanistically, Pho84 enhances the gastrointestinal commensalism via a dual-action activity, coordinating both phosphate uptake and TOR activation by induction of the transcriptional regulator Try4 and downstream commensalism-related transcription. As such, Pho84 promotes Candida albicans commensalism, but this does not translate into enhanced pathogenicity. Thus, our study uncovers a specific nutrient-dependent dual-action regulatory pathway for Pho84 on fungal commensalism.",-1
"Detection of Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) in ovitraps of MÃ©rida city, MÃ©xico","Introduction: The vector-borne diseases program in MÃ©xico has an established network of ovitraps for entomological surveillance of Aedes spp. In response to reports of Aedes albopictus in the periphery of MÃ©rida, the state capital of YucatÃ¡n, the Ministry of Health increased the specificity of this surveillance. Objective: To describe the presence and distribution of Ae. albopictus in MÃ©rida and its relative abundance compared to Aedes aegypti in ovitraps of the vector control program. Materials and methods: During October, 2019, 91 ovitraps were randomly selected from 31 neighborhoods of MÃ©rida. Mosquitoes were reared at the insectary of the Collaborative Unit for Entomological Bioassays of the Autonomous University of YucatÃ¡n from eggs collected in the field. Relative abundance was determined for adult individuals of each identified species and neighborhood. Results: 32 % of the neighborhoods were positive for Ae. albopictus and 100 % for Ae. aegypti. A total of 28 adults of Ae. albopictus (10 females and 18 males) were obtained from ovitraps. No correlation was observed between the abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for both adults and females (p>0.05) at the neighborhood level. Conclusions: The results confirm that Ae. albopictus coexisted with Ae. aegypti in MÃ©rida at the time of the study. The low relative abundance suggests that Ae. albopictus was in the initial phase of invasion.",-1
"Neutrophil/lymphocyte, platelet/lymphocyte and monocyte/lymphocyte ratios in patients with affective disorders","Objective:                    There is substantial evidence to support that the alterations in the immune-inflammation system play a crucial role in the pathogenic mechanism of affective disorders. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) have been recently investigated as simple, rapid, and inexpensive inflammation markers. The purpose of the research is to use large-scale clinical data to study the difference of the inflammation ratios in first-episode MDD, recurrent MDD, BD depressive episodes and manic episode.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional design was applied to retrospectively analyse the data that were extracted from electronic health records. A total of 16,174 Chinese affective disorder patients were enrolled in this study, and 6681 healthy subjects served as controls. The differences in the NLR, MLR, PLR and whole blood count data among different groups were compared, and the contributing factors for the occurrence of MDD and BD were analysed.              Results:                    First-episode and recurrent MDD patients exhibited significantly elevated NLRs and MLRs compared to healthy controls. Compared with the MDD patients, the BD patients showed higher NLRs and MLRs and lower PLRs. Further analysis showed that the BD manic episode patients had significantly elevated NLRs and MLRs compared to patients with BD depressive episodes or MDD. MLR was a risk factor for the occurrence of MDD and that the NLR and MLR were risk factors for the occurrence of BD.              Conclusions:                    Our study highlights the role of systemic inflammation in the pathophysiology of MDD and BD, particularly during manic BD episodes.",-1
The Role of Muscle Decline in Type 2 Diabetes Development: A 5-Year Prospective Observational Cohort Study,"The major risk factors of T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus) development are still under investigation. We evaluate the possible risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in adult subjects during a five-year prospective cohort study. We recruited 1160 subjects who underwent oral glucose tolerance test, anthropometric measurements, and body composition and body fat distribution analysis at a baseline visit and again at follow-up after approximately five years. The conclusions of this study are based on observation of 219 subjects who attended both the first and follow-up visits. The fasting serum insulin was measured, and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) was calculated. During the follow-up period, T2DM was diagnosed in 7.4% of participants, impaired fasting glucose in 37.7%, and impaired glucose tolerance in 9.3%. Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, were constructed. The changes in glucose concentration, visceral fat tissue content, insulin resistance, and %loss of muscle mass were chosen as the potential predictors for T2DM development. A set of independent variables was extracted. The constructed feature set comprised change in HOMA-IR (OR (odds ratio) = 1.01, p < 0.01) and change in %loss of muscle mass (OR = 0.84, p < 0.03). With an aim to validate the prediction capability using the selected attributes, a support vector machine classifier and leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was applied, yielding 92.78% classification accuracy. Our results show the correlation between the %loss of muscle mass and T2DM development in adults, independent of changes in insulin resistance.",-1
Accurate Machine Learning Model to Diagnose Chronic Autoimmune Diseases Utilizing Information From B Cells and Monocytes,"Heterogeneity and limited comprehension of chronic autoimmune disease pathophysiology cause accurate diagnosis a challenging process. With the increasing resources of single-cell sequencing data, a reasonable way could be found to address this issue. In our study, with the use of large-scale public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, analysis of dataset integration (3.1 Ã 105 PBMCs from fifteen SLE patients and eight healthy donors) and cellular cross talking (3.8 Ã 105 PBMCs from twenty-eight SLE patients and eight healthy donors) were performed to identify the most crucial information characterizing SLE. Our findings revealed that the interactions among the PBMC subpopulations of SLE patients may be weakened under the inflammatory microenvironment, which could result in abnormal emergences or variations in signaling patterns within PBMCs. In particular, the alterations of B cells and monocytes may be the most significant findings. Utilizing this powerful information, an efficient mathematical model of unbiased random forest machine learning was established to distinguish SLE patients from healthy donors via not only scRNA-seq data but also bulk RNA-seq data. Surprisingly, our mathematical model could also accurately identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, not just SLE, via bulk RNA-seq data (derived from 688 samples). Since the variations in PBMCs should predate the clinical manifestations of these diseases, our machine learning model may be feasible to develop into an efficient tool for accurate diagnosis of chronic autoimmune diseases.",-1
Identification of hand-foot syndrome from cancer patients' blog posts: BERT-based deep-learning approach to detect potential adverse drug reaction symptoms,"Early detection and management of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is crucial for improving patients' quality of life. Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is one of the most problematic ADRs for cancer patients. Recently, an increasing number of patients post their daily experiences to internet community, for example in blogs, where potential ADR signals not captured through routine clinic visits can be described. Therefore, this study aimed to identify patients with potential ADRs, focusing on HFS, from internet blogs by using natural language processing (NLP) deep-learning methods. From 10,646 blog posts, written in Japanese by cancer patients, 149 HFS-positive sentences were extracted after pre-processing, annotation and scrutiny by a certified oncology pharmacist. The HFS-positive sentences described not only HFS typical expressions like ""pain"" or ""spoon nail"", but also patient-derived unique expressions like onomatopoeic ones. The dataset was divided at a 4 to 1 ratio and used to train and evaluate three NLP deep-learning models: long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). The BERT model gave the best performance with precision 0.63, recall 0.82 and f1 score 0.71 in the HFS user identification task. Our results demonstrate that this NLP deep-learning model can successfully identify patients with potential HFS from blog posts, where patients' real wordings on symptoms or impacts on their daily lives are described. Thus, it should be feasible to utilize patient-generated text data to improve ADR management for individual patients.",-1
"Congenital microtia patients: the genetically engineered exosomes released from porous gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel for downstream small RNA profiling, functional modulation of microtia chondrocytes and tissue-engineered ear cartilage regeneration","Background:                    Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exosomes were previously shown to be effective in articular cartilage repairing. However, whether MSCs exosomes promote mature cartilage formation of microtia chondrocytes and the underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. Additionally, some hurdles, such as the low yield and unsatisfactory therapeutic effects of natural exosomes have emerged when considering the translation of exosomes-therapeutics to clinical practices or industrial production. Herein, we investigated the roles of human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) exosomes in modulating microtia chondrocytes and the underlying mechanism of action. Special attention was also paid to the mass production and functional modification of ADSCs exosomes.              Results:                    We firstly used porous gelatin methacryloyl (Porous Gelma) hydrogel with pores size of 100 to 200 Î¼m for 3D culture of passage 2, 4 and 6 ADSCs (P2, P4 and P6 ADSCs, respectively), and obtained their corresponding exosomes (Exo 2, Exo 4 and Exo 6, respectively). In vitro results showed Exo 2 outperformed both Exo 4 and Exo 6 in enhancing cell proliferation and attenuating apoptosis. However, both Exo 4 and Exo 6 promoted chondrogenesis more than Exo 2 did. Small RNA sequencing results indicated Exo 4 was similar to Exo 6 in small RNA profiles and consistently upregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Notably, we found hsa-miR-23a-3p was highly expressed in Exo 4 and Exo 6 compared to Exo 2, and they modulated microtia chondrocytes by transferring hsa-miR-23a-3p to suppress PTEN expression, and consequently to activate PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Then, we designed genetically engineered exosomes by directly transfecting agomir-23a-3p into parent P4 ADSCs and isolated hsa-miR-23a-3p-rich exosomes for optimizing favorable effects on cell viability and new cartilage formation. Subsequently, we applied the engineered exosomes to in vitro and in vivo tissue-engineered cartilage culture and consistently found that the engineered exosomes could enhance cell proliferation, attenuate apoptosis and promote cartilage regeneration.              Conclusions:                    Taken together, the porous Gelma hydrogel could be applied to exosomes mass production, and functional modification could be achieved by selecting P4 ADSCs as parent cells and genetically modifying ADSCs. Our engineered exosomes are a promising candidate for tissue-engineered ear cartilage regeneration.",-1
Phases of Metabolic and Soft Tissue Changes in Months Preceding a Diagnosis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma,"Background & aims:                    Identifying metabolic abnormalities that occur before pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosis could increase chances for early detection. We collected data on changes in metabolic parameters (glucose, serum lipids, triglycerides; total, low-density, and high-density cholesterol; and total body weight) and soft tissues (abdominal subcutaneous fat [SAT], adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue [VAT], and muscle) from patients 5 years before the received a diagnosis of PDAC.              Methods:                    We collected data from 219 patients with a diagnosis of PDAC (patients) and 657 healthy individuals (controls) from the Rochester Epidemiology Project, from 2000 through 2015. We compared metabolic profiles of patients with those of age- and sex-matched controls, constructing temporal profiles of fasting blood glucose, serum lipids including triglycerides, cholesterol profiles, and body weight and temperature for 60 months before the diagnosis of PDAC (index date). To construct the temporal profile of soft tissue changes, we collected computed tomography scans from 68 patients, comparing baseline (>18 months before diagnosis) areas of SAT, VAT, and muscle at L2/L3 vertebra with those of later scans until time of diagnosis. SAT and VAT, isolated from healthy individuals, were exposed to exosomes isolated from PDAC cell lines and analyzed by RNA sequencing. SAT was collected from KRAS+/LSLG12D P53flox/flox mice with PDACs, C57/BL6 (control) mice, and 5 patients and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry.              Results:                    There were no significant differences in metabolic or soft tissue features of patients vs controls until 30 months before PDAC diagnosis. In the 30 to 18 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 1, hyperglycemia), a significant proportion of patients developed hyperglycemia, compared with controls, without soft tissue changes. In the 18 to 6 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 2, pre-cachexia), patients had significant increases in hyperglycemia and decreases in serum lipids, body weight, and SAT, with preserved VAT and muscle. In the 6 to 0 months before PDAC diagnosis (phase 3, cachexia), a significant proportion of patients had hyperglycemia compared with controls, and patients had significant reductions in all serum lipids, SAT, VAT, and muscle. We believe the patients had browning of SAT, based on increases in body temperature, starting 18 months before PDAC diagnosis. We observed expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in SAT exposed to PDAC exosomes, SAT from mice with PDACs, and SAT from all 5 patients but only 1 of 4 controls.              Conclusions:                    We identified 3 phases of metabolic and soft tissue changes that precede a diagnosis of PDAC. Loss of SAT starts 18 months before PDAC identification, and is likely due to browning. Overexpression of UCP1 in SAT might be a biomarker of early-stage PDAC, but further studies are needed.",-1
Personal protection with PBO-pyrethroid synergist-treated nets after 2 years of household use against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles in Tanzania,"Background:                    The spread of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors threatens the effectiveness of standard long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN). Synergist nets combine pyrethroid (Py) and piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) to enhance potency against resistance mediated by mono-oxygenase mechanisms. Our project assessed personal protection of the World Health Organization first-in-class PBO-Py LLIN (Olyset Plus) versus the standard LLIN (Olyset net) against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and An. funestus in North-West Tanzania after 20 months of household use.              Methods:                    From a household survey, 39 standard Olyset net and 39 Olyset Plus houses were selected. The physical integrity and hole index (HI) of the nets were assessed, and resting mosquitoes were collected from inside nets and from room walls. The indoor abundance was estimated using CDC light traps and species identified using PCR. The bioefficacy of PBO and standard LLINs against wild Anopheles was assessed using 30-minute cylinder bioassays.              Results:                    Of 2397 Anopheles collected, 8.9% (n = 213) were resting inside standard Olyset nets, while none were found inside Olyset Plus nets (PBO-Py LLINs) of any HI category. Resting density of blood-fed mosquitoes was higher on walls of sleeping rooms with Olyset nets compared to Olyset Plus (0.62 vs 0.10, density ratio [DR]: 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.13, p < 0.001). Mosquitoes were found inside Olyset nets of all WHO HI categories, but more were collected inside the more damaged nets (HI â?643) than in less damaged (HI 0-64) nets (DR: 6.4, 95% CI 1.1-36.0, p = 0.037). In bioassay, mortality of An. gambiae s.l. was higher with Olyset Plus than with Olyset nets for new nets (76.8% vs 27.5%) and nets used for 20 months (56.8% vs 12.8%); similar trends were observed with An. funestus.              Conclusion:                    The PBO-Py LLINs provided improved protection after 20 months of household use, as demonstrated by the higher bioassay mortality and absence of pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and An. funestus collected from inside Olyset Plus nets, irrespective of HI category, as compared to Olyset nets.",-1
A game changer for bipolar disorder diagnosis using RNA editing-based biomarkers,"In clinical practice, differentiating Bipolar Disorder (BD) from unipolar depression is a challenge due to the depressive symptoms, which are the core presentations of both disorders. This misdiagnosis during depressive episodes results in a delay in proper treatment and a poor management of their condition. In a first step, using A-to-I RNA editome analysis, we discovered 646 variants (366 genes) differentially edited between depressed patients and healthy volunteers in a discovery cohort of 57 participants. After using stringent criteria and biological pathway analysis, candidate biomarkers from 8 genes were singled out and tested in a validation cohort of 410 participants. Combining the selected biomarkers with a machine learning approach achieved to discriminate depressed patients (n = 267) versus controls (n = 143) with an AUC of 0.930 (CI 95% [0.879-0.982]), a sensitivity of 84.0% and a specificity of 87.1%. In a second step by selecting among the depressed patients those with unipolar depression (n = 160) or BD (n = 95), we identified a combination of 6 biomarkers which allowed a differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder with an AUC of 0.935 and high specificity (Sp = 84.6%) and sensitivity (Se = 90.9%). The association of RNA editing variants modifications with depression subtypes and the use of artificial intelligence allowed developing a new tool to identify, among depressed patients, those suffering from BD. This test will help to reduce the misdiagnosis delay of bipolar patients, leading to an earlier implementation of a proper treatment.",-1
Explainable AI in Diagnosing and Anticipating Leukemia Using Transfer Learning Method,"White blood cells (WBCs) are blood cells that fight infections and diseases as a part of the immune system. They are also known as ""defender cells."" But the imbalance in the number of WBCs in the blood can be hazardous. Leukemia is the most common blood cancer caused by an overabundance of WBCs in the immune system. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) usually occurs when the bone marrow creates many immature WBCs that destroy healthy cells. People of all ages, including children and adolescents, can be affected by ALL. The rapid proliferation of atypical lymphocyte cells can cause a reduction in new blood cells and increase the chances of death in patients. Therefore, early and precise cancer detection can help with better therapy and a higher survival probability in the case of leukemia. However, diagnosing ALL is time-consuming and complicated, and manual analysis is expensive, with subjective and error-prone outcomes. Thus, detecting normal and malignant cells reliably and accurately is crucial. For this reason, automatic detection using computer-aided diagnostic models can help doctors effectively detect early leukemia. The entire approach may be automated using image processing techniques, reducing physicians' workload and increasing diagnosis accuracy. The impact of deep learning (DL) on medical research has recently proven quite beneficial, offering new avenues and possibilities in the healthcare domain for diagnostic techniques. However, to make that happen soon in DL, the entire community must overcome the explainability limit. Because of the black box operation's shortcomings in artificial intelligence (AI) models' decisions, there is a lack of liability and trust in the outcomes. But explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can solve this problem by interpreting the predictions of AI systems. This study emphasizes leukemia, specifically ALL. The proposed strategy recognizes acute lymphoblastic leukemia as an automated procedure that applies different transfer learning models to classify ALL. Hence, using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) to assure validity and reliability, this method also explains the cause of a specific classification. The proposed method achieved 98.38% accuracy with the InceptionV3 model. Experimental results were found between different transfer learning methods, including ResNet101V2, VGG19, and InceptionResNetV2, later verified with the LIME algorithm for XAI, where the proposed method performed the best. The obtained results and their reliability demonstrate that it can be preferred in identifying ALL, which will assist medical examiners.",-1
Effects of in vitro digestion and fermentation of Nostoc commune Vauch. polysaccharides on properties and gut microbiota,"Nostoc commune Vauch. polysaccharides (NCVP) was extracted from Nostoc commune Vauch. with strong biological properties. The molecular weight of NCVPs (NCVP, NCVP-S, NCVP-G, and NCVP-I) exhibited a downward trend, and the molar ratio of constituent monosaccharides of NCVPs significantly changed, implying that NCVP could be degraded under in vitro simulated digestion. The antioxidant activities of NCVPs were significantly improved during in vitro digestion. In addition, NCVPs had a prebiotic effect on Lactobacillus strain. During in vitro fermentation, NCVP was degraded and utilized by the gut microbiota, and a variety of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were formed. Functional gene prediction of 16S rDNA sequencing data inferred that NCVP could promote gut metabolism and improve the body's defense mechanism. Overall, these findings emphasized that NCVP is beneficial by maintaining the gut health and can be used as potential prebiotics in the functional foods and medicine industries.",-1
Breast cancer histopathological images classification based on deep semantic features and gray level co-occurrence matrix,"Breast cancer is regarded as the leading killer of women today. The early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is the key to improving the survival rate of patients. A method of breast cancer histopathological images recognition based on deep semantic features and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features is proposed in this paper. Taking the pre-trained DenseNet201 as the basic model, part of the convolutional layer features of the last dense block are extracted as the deep semantic features, which are then fused with the three-channel GLCM features, and the support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. For the BreaKHis dataset, we explore the classification problems of magnification specific binary (MSB) classification and magnification independent binary (MIB) classification, and compared the performance with the seven baseline models of AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, GoogLeNet, DenseNet201, SqueezeNet and Inception-ResNet-V2. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper performs better than the pre-trained baseline models in MSB and MIB classification problems. The highest image-level recognition accuracy of 40Ã, 100Ã, 200Ã, 400Ã is 96.75%, 95.21%, 96.57%, and 93.15%, respectively. And the highest patient-level recognition accuracy of the four magnifications is 96.33%, 95.26%, 96.09%, and 92.99%, respectively. The image-level and patient-level recognition accuracy for MIB classification is 95.56% and 95.54%, respectively. In addition, the recognition accuracy of the method in this paper is comparable to some state-of-the-art methods.",-1
"Black African men with early type 2 diabetes have similar muscle, liver and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity to white European men despite lower visceral fat","Aims/hypothesis:                    Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in black African than white European populations although, paradoxically, black African individuals present with lower levels of visceral fat, which has a known association with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance occurs at a tissue-specific level; however, no study has simultaneously compared whole body, skeletal muscle, hepatic and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity between black and white men. We hypothesised that, in those with early type 2 diabetes, black (West) African men (BAM) have greater hepatic and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, compared with white European men (WEM), because of their reduced visceral fat.              Methods:                    Eighteen BAM and 15 WEM with type 2 diabetes underwent a two-stage hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp with stable glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess tissue-specific insulin sensitivity and a magnetic resonance imaging scan to assess body composition.              Results:                    We found no ethnic differences in whole body, skeletal muscle, hepatic or adipose tissue insulin sensitivity between BAM and WEM. This finding occurred in the presence of lower visceral fat in BAM (3.72 vs 5.68 kg [mean difference -1.96, 95% CI -3.30, 0.62]; p = 0.01). There was an association between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in WEM that was not present in BAM (r = 0.78, p < 0.01 vs r = 0.25 p = 0.37).              Conclusions/interpretation:                    Our data suggest that in type 2 diabetes there are no ethnic differences in whole body, skeletal muscle, hepatic and adipose tissue insulin sensitivity between black and white men, despite differences in visceral adipose tissue, and that impaired lipolysis may not be contributing to skeletal muscle insulin resistance in men of black African ethnicity.",-1
"Diabetes Rescue, Engagement and Management (D-REM): rationale and design of a pragmatic clinical trial of a community paramedicine programme to improve diabetes care","Introduction:                    Diabetes is one of the most common serious chronic health conditions in the USA. People living with diabetes face multiple barriers to optimal diabetes care, including gaps in access to medical care and self-management education, diabetes distress, and high burden of treatment. Community paramedics (CPs) are uniquely positioned to support multidisciplinary care for patients with diabetes by delivering focused diabetes self-management education and support and bridging the gaps between patients and the clinical and community resources they need to live well with their disease.              Methods and analysis:                    We will conduct a pragmatic single-arm prospective trial of a CP-led Diabetes Rescue, Engagement and Management (D-REM) programme that seeks to reduce diabetes distress. We will enrol 70 adults (â?8 years) with diabetes who have haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)â?.0%, experienced an emergency department (ED) visit or hospitalisation for any cause within the prior 6 months, and reside in areas with available CP support in Southeast Minnesota (Olmsted, Freeborn and Mower counties) and Northwest Wisconsin (Barron, Rusk and Dunn counties). Participants will be identified using Mayo Clinic electronic health records, contacted for consent and enrolled into the D-REM programme. Visit frequency will be individualised for each patient, but will be an average of four CP visits over the course of approximately 1 month. Outcomes will be change in diabetes distress (primary outcome), confidence in diabetes self-management, health-related quality of life, self-reported hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, HbA1c, ED visits and hospitalisations. Outcomes will be assessed on enrolment, programme completion and 3 months after programme completion.              Ethics and dissemination:                    The study was approved by Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations. If demonstrated to be successful, this model of care can be implemented across diverse settings and populations to support patients living with diabetes.              Trial registration number:        NCT04385758.",-1
Short Chain Fatty Acids Taken at Time of Thrombectomy in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Are Independent of Stroke Severity But Associated With Inflammatory Markers and Worse Symptoms at Discharge,"Introduction:                    Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are gut microbiota-derived metabolites that contribute to the gut-brain axis and may impact stroke outcomes following gut dysbiosis. We evaluated plasma SCFA concentrations against stroke severity parameters and identified SCFA-associated protein networks.              Methods:                    The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC), a continuously enrolling tissue bank, was used to obtain stroke samples. Arterial blood distal and proximal to the thrombus was obtained from Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) Patients (n=53) during thrombectomy. Patient demographics, stroke presentation and outcome parameters were reported. The SCFAs were isolated from proximal plasma via chemical derivatization UHPLC coupled tandem mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring. Proteomic levels for 184 cardioembolic and inflammatory proteins was quantified from systemic and intracranial plasma by Olink. Arterial blood from cerebrovascular patients undergoing elective neurointerventional procedures was used as controls.              Results:                    Acetate positively correlated with time from last known normal (LKN) and was significantly lower in stroke patients compared to control. Isobutyrate, Butyrate and 2-Methylbutyrate negatively correlated with %ÎNIHSS. Isobutyrate and 2-Methylbutyrate positively correlated with NIHSS discharge. SCFA concentrations were not associated with NIHSS admission, infarct volume, or edema volume. Multiple SCFAs positively associated with systemic and pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IL-6, TNF-Î±, VCAM1, IL-17, and MCP-1.              Conclusions:                    Plasma SCFA concentrations taken at time of stroke are not associated with stroke severity at presentation. However, higher levels of SCFAs at the time of stroke are associated with increased markers of inflammation, less recovery from admission to discharge, and worse symptom burden at discharge.",-1
Continuous glucose monitoring demonstrates low risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia associated with sulphonylurea treatment in an African type 2 diabetes population: results from the OPTIMAL observational multicenter study,"Introduction:                    People living with diabetes in low-resource settings may be at increased hypoglycemia risk due to food insecurity and limited access to glucose monitoring. We aimed to assess hypoglycemia risk associated with sulphonylurea (SU) and insulin therapy in people living with type 2 diabetes in a low-resource sub-Saharan African setting.              Research design and methods:                    This study was conducted in the outpatients' diabetes clinics of two hospitals (one rural and one urban) in Uganda. We used blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-report to compare hypoglycemia rates and duration in 179 type 2 diabetes patients treated with sulphonylureas (n=100) and insulin (n=51) in comparison with those treated with metformin only (n=28). CGM-assessed hypoglycemia was defined as minutes per week below 3mmol/L (54mg/dL) and number of hypoglycemic events below 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) for at least 15 minutes.              Results:                    CGM recorded hypoglycemia was infrequent in SU-treated participants and did not differ from metformin: median minutes/week of glucose <3 mmol/L were 39.2, 17.0 and 127.5 for metformin, sulphonylurea and insulin, respectively (metformin vs sulphonylurea, p=0.6). Hypoglycemia risk was strongly related to glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose, with most episodes occurring in those with tight glycemic control. After adjusting for HbA1c, time <3 mmol/L was 2.1 (95% CI 0.9 to 4.7) and 5.5 (95% CI 2.4 to 12.6) times greater with sulphonylurea and insulin, respectively, than metformin alone.              Conclusions:                    In a low-resource sub-Saharan African setting, hypoglycemia is infrequent among people with type 2 diabetes receiving sulphonylurea treatment, and the modest excess occurs predominantly in those with tight glycemic control.",-1
Assessment of Developmental and Reproductive Fitness of Dengue-Resistant Transgenic Aedes aegypti and Improvement of Fitness Using Antibiotics,"Background:                    Genetic modification offers opportunities to introduce artificially created molecular defence mechanisms to vector mosquitoes to counter diseases causing pathogens such as the dengue virus, malaria parasite, and Zika virus. RNA interference is such a molecular defence mechanism that could be used for this purpose to block the transmission of pathogens among human and animal populations. In our previous study, we engineered a dengue-resistant transgenic Ae. aegypti using RNAi to turn off the expression of dengue virus serotype genomes to reduce virus transmission, requiring assessment of the fitness of this mosquito with respect to its wild counterpart in the laboratory and semifield conditions.              Method:                    Developmental and reproductive fitness parameters of TM and WM have assessed under the Arthropod Containment Level 2 conditions, and the antibiotic treatment assays were conducted using co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, and doxycycline to assess the developmental and reproductive fitness parameters.              Results:                    A significant reduction of developmental and reproductive fitness parameters was observed in transgenic mosquito compared to wild mosquitoes. However, it was seen in laboratory-scale studies that the fitness of this mosquito has improved significantly in the presence of antibiotics such as co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, and doxycycline in their feed.              Conclusion:                    Our data indicate that the transgenic mosquito produced had a reduction of the fitness parameters and it may lead to a subsequent reduction of transgenic vector density over the generations in field applications. However, antibiotics of co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin, and doxycycline have shown the improvement of fitness parameters indicating the usefulness in field release of transgenic mosquitoes.",-1
"A Prospective Clinical Trial of Prolonged Fasting in Healthy Young Males and Females-Effect on Fatigue, Sleepiness, Mood and Body Composition","Fasting during a long period (17-18 h/day) may affect daily performance. Fatigue is one of important parameters to observe for this effect. This study aimed to determine the effect of Ramadan fasting (RF)-particularly on fatigue in both young males and females. Sleepiness, mood-related symptoms (MRSs) and body composition (BC) were determined, too. Thirty-four young males and females were recruited and performed RF. They were assessed for fatigue, sleepiness, MRS and BC at T1 (one week before RF), T2 (mid of RF), T3 (last days of RF), T4 (one week after RF) and T5 (one month after RF). The assessments were done in the morning, except for fatigue and sleepiness, which were also assessed in the afternoon and evening of T1 to T5. This study observed numerous positive effects to RF. After they began fasting and compared to T1, participants experienced (1) significantly less fatigue; (2) small to large improvement of MRSs; and (3) positive changes relating to BC. RF did not appear to have a significant effect on participants' sleepiness scores. Ultimately, this study illustrates how prolonged fasting, like RF, benefits the youth, particularly by decreasing fatigue, improving MRSs and positively impacting BC.",-1
Effect of diet with or without exercise on abdominal fat in postmenopausal women - a randomised trial,"Background:                    We assessed the effect of equivalent weight loss with or without exercise on (intra-) abdominal fat in postmenopausal women in the SHAPE-2 study.              Methods:                    The SHAPE-2 study is a three-armed randomised controlled trial conducted in 2012-2013 in the Netherlands. Postmenopausal overweight women were randomized to a diet (n = 97), exercise plus diet (n = 98) or control group (n = 48). Both intervention groups aimed for equivalent weight loss (6-7%) following a calorie-restricted diet (diet group) or a partly supervised intensive exercise programme (4 h per week) combined with a small caloric restriction (exercise plus diet group). Outcomes after 16 weeks are amount and distribution of abdominal fat, measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of the three-point IDEAL Dixon method.              Results:                    The diet and exercise plus diet group lost 6.1 and 6.9% body weight, respectively. Compared to controls, subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat reduced significantly with both diet (- 12.5% and - 12.0%) and exercise plus diet (- 16.0% and - 14.6%). Direct comparison between both interventions revealed that the reduction in subcutaneous fat was statistically significantly larger in the group that combined exercise with diet: an additional 10.6 cm2 (95%CI -18.7; - 2.4) was lost compared to the diet-only group. Intra-abdominal fat loss was not significantly larger in the exercise plus diet group (- 3.8 cm2, 95%CI -9.0; 1.3).              Conclusions:                    We conclude that weight loss of 6-7% with diet or with exercise plus diet reduced both subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat. Only subcutaneous fat statistically significantly reduced to a larger extent when exercise is combined with a small caloric restriction.

Organophosphate esters exposure in relation to glucose homeostasis and type 2 diabetes in adults: A national cross-sectional study from the national health and nutrition survey,"Background:                    Exposure to organophosphate esters (OPEs) may be associated with impaired glucose homeostasis and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adolescent. However, the evidence in general population is scarce, especially for glucose homeostasis. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2008 and 2011-2012 to investigate the relationship of urinary OPEs with glucose homeostasis and T2D in adults.              Methods:                    A total of 5347 participants aged â?0 years were included. The exposures were the concentrations of urinary OPEs metabolites [dimethyl phosphate (DMP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), dimethyl dithiophosphate (DMDTP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP)]. The health outcomes were prevalence of T2D and glucose homeostasis [i.e., fasting glucose, 2-h plasma glucose during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (2 h-OGTT), serum insulin, HemoglobinA1c (HbA1c), HOMA-IR, and HOMA-Î²]. The multivariable linear regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between OPEs and glucose homeostasis. The multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between OPEs and prevalence of T2D.              Results:                    The OPEs compound DMTP was significantly associated with higher levels of serum insulin [Î² (95%confidence interval, CI) = 0.21 (0.06,0.36), for one unit increase in log2-transformed exposure] and HOMA IR [Î² (95%CI) = 0.08 (0.02,0.14)], and increased odds of T2D [odds ratio (95% CI) = 1.05 (1.01-1.08)]. Other OPEs were not statistically associated with the serum markers for glucose homeostasis or T2D prevalence.              Conclusion:                    Our study found that the OPEs compound DMTP might be associated with impaired glucose homeostasis and may increase the prevalence of T2D in U.S. adults. Further longitudinal or experimental studies are warranted to verify our findings in different populations and different OPEs concentrations.",-1
Mapping the Diverse and Inclusive Future of Parkinson's Disease Genetics and Its Widespread Impact,"Over the last decades, genetics has been the engine that has pushed us along on our voyage to understand the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although a large number of risk loci and causative mutations for PD have been identified, it is clear that much more needs to be done to solve the missing heritability mystery. Despite remarkable efforts, as a field, we have failed in terms of diversity and inclusivity. The vast majority of genetic studies in PD have focused on individuals of European ancestry, leading to a gap of knowledge on the existing genetic differences across populations and PD as a whole. As we move forward, shedding light on the genetic architecture contributing to PD in non-European populations is essential, and will provide novel insight into the generalized genetic map of the disease. In this review, we discuss how better representation of understudied ancestral groups in PD genetics research requires addressing and resolving all the challenges that hinder the inclusion of these populations. We further provide an overview of PD genetics in the clinics, covering the current challenges and limitations of genetic testing and counseling. Finally, we describe the impact of worldwide collaborative initiatives in the field, shaping the future of the new era of PD genetics as we advance in our understanding of the genetic architecture of PD.",-1
Plasma Metabolites Related to Peripheral and Hepatic Insulin Sensitivity Are Not Directly Linked to Gut Microbiota Composition,"Plasma metabolites affect a range of metabolic functions in humans, including insulin sensitivity (IS). A subset of these plasma metabolites is modified by the gut microbiota. To identify potential microbial-metabolite pathways involved in IS, we investigated the link between plasma metabolites, gut microbiota composition, and IS, using the gold-standard for peripheral and hepatic IS measurement in a group of participants with metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). In a cross-sectional study with 115 MetSyn participants, fasting plasma samples were collected for untargeted metabolomics analysis and fecal samples for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. A two-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was performed to assess peripheral and hepatic IS. Collected data were integrated and potential interdependence between metabolites, gut microbiota, and IS was analyzed using machine learning prediction models. Plasma metabolites explained 13.2% and 16.7% of variance in peripheral and hepatic IS, respectively. Fecal microbiota composition explained 4.2% of variance in peripheral IS and was not related to hepatic IS. Although metabolites could partially explain the variances in IS, the top metabolites related to peripheral and hepatic IS did not significantly correlate with gut microbiota composition (both on taxonomical level and alpha-diversity). However, all plasma metabolites could explain 18.5% of the variance in microbial alpha-diversity (Shannon); the top 20 metabolites could even explain 44.5% of gut microbial alpha-diversity. In conclusion, plasma metabolites could partially explain the variance in peripheral and hepatic IS; however, these metabolites were not directly linked to the gut microbiota composition, underscoring the intricate relation between plasma metabolites, the gut microbiota, and IS in MetSyn.",-1
Dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation caused by Salmonella Typhimurium in mice can be alleviated by preadministration of a lytic phage,"Many studies have shown the efficacy of phage therapy in reducing intestinal pathogens. However, phage-based probiotic treatment is poorly studied in view of effects on the gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation. In this study, a lytic or a temperate phage (each at 4 Ã108 PFU per day) or a streptomycin solution (40 mg per day) were administered to mice via drinking water for 31 days. Subsequently, mice were challenged with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). S. Typhimurium does not serve as the host bacterium and is not lysed by both phages. For intestinal inflammation evaluation, mice were given one dose of streptomycin for 24 h before the S. Typhimurium challenge. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the phylum Firmicutes became the most abundant in mice pretreated with phages. The alpha diversity of gut bacteria was higher in phage treated than in streptomycin treated mice. Moreover, pretreatment with the lytic and the temperate phage before the S. Typhimurium challenge increased two beneficial genera, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. According to the pathological analysis of ileum, cecum, and serum, temperate or lytic gut phage pretreatment of mice markedly reduced intestinal inflammation, concomitant with lower serum concentration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and diamine oxidase (DAO). The oral pretreatments of mice (ST, Lyt, Lys, SM) generally caused an increased expression of IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-4, and IL-10 compared to the matching control. However, in mice pretreated with the lytic phage, the mRNA expression for the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± was not significantly higher than that of the control group. No significant differences were detected for peripheral blood B lymphocytes, CD3 +T cells, and the CD4 + /CD8 + ratio in mice pretreated with the lytic and lysogenic phage. This study demonstrated that even lytic phages not targeting the pathogenic serovar Salmonella Typhimurium alleviated intestinal dysbiosis and inflammation in challenged mice.",-1
Macrophages of the subcutaneous and omental fatty tissue in obese patients: Immunohistochemical phenotyping of M2 subtypes in relation to type 2 diabetes,"Background and aims:                    Macrophages are linked to the initiation of the chronic inflammation believed to underlie the changes taking place in the white fatty tissue of obese people. Both the number of macrophages, but their functional status, play an important role in the development of inflammation. Classically, macrophages are divided into two types: pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) types, and based on current immunological studies, further views on the functional distribution of macrophages are suggested. In this study, we evaluated the M1 and M2 macrophages ratio in obese subjects with, or without diabetes. To identify all macrophages, we used CD68 expression, while CD204 expression is typically used for the M2 macrophage.              Materials and methods:                    During bariatric surgery, carried out in obese people with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D), we obtained subcutaneous adipose tissue from the navel and omental adipose tissue. We also obtained the same tissue from people with a physiological range of BMI from a judicial autopsy. Applying immunohistochemical staining anti-CD68 and anti-CD204, we carried out a quantitative evaluation of the number of macrophages.              Results:                    We found CD68+ and CD204+ positive macrophages in perivascular spaces and between fat cells, both isolated and in larger infiltrates. They were also present in so-called ""crown-like structures"" (CLS) around dying adipocytes. Quantitative analysis showed an increased number of macrophages in all obese patients compared to the control group of non-obese, individuals without T2D. The most striking observation was the macrophage increase in the visceral fatty tissue of diabetics. The number of CD68 and CD204 positive macrophages was statistically significantly smaller in patients without T2D.              Conclusion:                    We demonstrated a significantly greater number of macrophages in visceral adipose tissue, especially in patients with T2D. Our results also show a positive correlation between the presence of T2D and the total number of macrophages; a significantly greater number of macrophages were found in visceral adipose tissue, especially in patients with T2D.",-1
A Machine Learning Approach for the Detection of QRS Complexes in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) Algorithm,"This study describes a modified approach for the detection of cardiac abnormalities and QRS complexes using machine learning and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The suggested technique overtakes prevailing approaches in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, with 0.45 percent detection error rate for cardiac irregularities. Moreover, the vector machine classifiers validated the proposed method's superiority by accurately categorising four ECG beat types: normal, LBBBs, RBBBs, and Paced beat. The technique had 96.67 percent accuracy in MLP-BP and 98.39 percent accuracy in support of vector machine classifiers. The results imply that the SVM classifier can play an important role in the analysis of cardiac abnormalities. Furthermore, the SVM classifier also categorises ECG beats using DWT characteristics collected from ECG signals.",-1
"Over-expression of long non-coding RNA NORAD promotes trophoblastic cell viability, migration, and invasion in preeclampsia via the miR-202-5p/FXR1 axis","Objective:                    Abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is critical in preeclampsia (PE) pathogenesis. The current study explored the function of non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD) in the progression of PE.              Materials and methods:                    Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to determine the expression of NORAD, microRNA (miR)-202-5p, and fragile X-related gene 1 (FXR1) in PE and normal placenta tissues. Cell viability was determined using 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-h-tetrazolium bromide assay, and cell migration and invasion were assessed using the Transwell assay. Target relationships were confirmed with the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Western blotting was performed to determine the protein level of FXR1.              Results:                    NORAD expression was markedly reduced in PE placenta. NORAD over-expression enhanced the viability, migration, and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. miR-202-5p was a target and was negatively regulated by NORAD. Down-regulation of miR-202-5p promoted the viability, migration, and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. miR-202-5p inversely regulated FXR1 expression by targeting the 3'UTR of FXR1. Both miR-202-5p up-regulation and FXR1 knockdown reversed the NORAD over-expression-induced enhancement in the viability, migration, and invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells.              Conclusion:                    Collectively, the results revealed that NORAD over-expression promoted trophoblast viability, invasion, and migration by regulating the miR-202-5p/FXR1 axis. These findings clarify PE pathogenesis and will inform the discovery of new targets for PE treatment.",-1
Anti-inflammatory microRNA-146a protects mice from diet-induced metabolic disease,"Identifying regulatory mechanisms that influence inflammation in metabolic tissues is critical for developing novel metabolic disease treatments. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) during diet-induced obesity in mice. miR-146a is reduced in obese and type 2 diabetic patients and our results reveal that miR-146a-/- mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) have exaggerated weight gain, increased adiposity, hepatosteatosis, and dysregulated blood glucose levels compared to wild-type controls. Pro-inflammatory genes and NF-ÎºB activation increase in miR-146a-/- mice, indicating a role for this miRNA in regulating inflammatory pathways. RNA-sequencing of adipose tissue macrophages demonstrated a role for miR-146a in regulating both inflammation and cellular metabolism, including the mTOR pathway, during obesity. Further, we demonstrate that miR-146a regulates inflammation, cellular respiration and glycolysis in macrophages through a mechanism involving its direct target Traf6. Finally, we found that administration of rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, was able to rescue the obesity phenotype in miR-146a-/- mice. Altogether, our study provides evidence that miR-146a represses inflammation and diet-induced obesity and regulates metabolic processes at the cellular and organismal levels, demonstrating how the combination of diet and miRNA genetics influences obesity and diabetic phenotypes.",-1
Malaria risk stratification in Colombia 2010 to 2019,"Background:                    Heterogeneity and focalization are the most common epidemiological characteristics of endemic countries in the Americas, where malaria transmission is moderate and low. During malaria elimination, the first step is to perform a risk stratification exercise to prioritize interventions. This study aimed to identify malaria risk strata in the ecoepidemiological regions of Colombia.              Methods:                    This was a descriptive and retrospective study using cumulative malaria cases in 1,122 municipalities of Colombia from 2010 to 2019. To identify the strata, the criteria proposed by PAHO were adapted. To classify the receptive areas (strata 2, 3, and 4) and nonreceptive areas (stratum 1), 1,600 m above sea level, ecotypes, main malaria vector presence, Plasmodium species prevalence and occurrence of malaria cases were used. The area occupied by the receptive municipalities, the cumulative burden, and the at-risk population in the regions were calculated.              Results:                    Ninety-one percent of the Colombian territory is receptive to the transmission of malaria and includes 749 municipalities with 9,734,271 (9,514,243-9,954,299) million at-risk inhabitants. Stratum 4 accounted for 96.7% of the malaria burden, and cases were concentrated primarily in the Pacific and Uraba-Bajo Cauca-Sinu-San Jorge regions. Plasmodium vivax predominates in most of the receptive municipalities, except in the municipalities of the Pacific region, where P. falciparum predominates. Anopheles albimanus, An. nuneztovari s.l., and An. darlingi were the main vectors in receptive areas.              Conclusions:                    In Colombia, 91.2% of the territory is receptive to the transmission of malaria and is characterized by being both heterogeneous and focused. Stratum 4 contains the greatest burden of disease, with a relatively greater proportion of municipalities with a predominance of P. vivax. However, there is a low proportion of municipalities with P. falciparum mainly in the Pacific region. These findings suggest that the latter be prioritized within the malaria elimination plan in Colombia.",-1
Metabolomics of human fasting: new insights about old questions,"Since ancient days, human fasting has been performed for religious or political reasons. More recently, fasting has been employed as an effective therapy for weight reduction by obese people, and numerous studies have investigated the physiology of fasting by obese subjects. Well-established fasting markers (butyrates, BCAAs and carnitines) were considered essential energy substitutes after glycogen storage depletion. However, a recently developed metabolomic approach has unravelled previously unappreciated aspects of fasting. Surprisingly, one-third (44) of 120 metabolites investigated increase during 58 h of fasting, including antioxidative metabolites (carnosine, ophthalmic acid, ergothioneine and urates) and metabolites of entire pathways, such as the pentose phosphate pathway. Signalling metabolites (3-hydroxybutyrate and 2-oxoglutarate) and purines/pyrimidines may also serve as transcriptional modulators. Thus, prolonged fasting activates both global catabolism and anabolism, reprogramming metabolic homeostasis.",-1
MicroRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network Mediates Activation of mTOR and VEGF Signaling in African American Prostate Cancer,"African American (AA) men exhibit 1.6-fold higher prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and 2.4-fold higher mortality rates compared to European American (EA) men. In addition to socioeconomic factors, emerging evidence suggests that intrinsic biological differences may explain part of PCa disparities. In this study, we applied microRNA (miRNA)-driven bioinformatics to evaluate whether differential miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks play a role in promoting the AA PCa disparities. 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were imported to mirPath V.3 algorithm, leading to identification of 58 signaling pathways differentially regulated in AA PCa versus EA PCa. Among these pathways, we particularly focused on mTOR and VEGF signaling, where we identified 5 reciprocal miRNA-mRNA pairings: miR-34a-5p/HIF1A, miR-34a-5p/PIK3CB, miR-34a-5p/IGFBP2, miR-99b-5p/MTOR and miR-96-5p/MAPKAPK2 in AA PCa versus EA PCa. RT-qPCR validation confirmed that miR-34a-5p, miR-99b-5p and MAPKAPK2 were downregulated, while miR-96-5p, IGFBP2, HIF1A, PIK3CB and MTOR were upregulated in AA PCa versus EA PCa cells. Transfection of miRNA mimics/antagomir followed by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis further verified that IGFBP2, HIF1A and PIK3CB are negatively regulated by miR-34a-5p, whereas MTOR and MAPKAPK2 are negatively regulated by miR-99b-5p and miR-96-5p, respectively, at mRNA and protein levels. Targeting reciprocal pairings by miR-34a-5p mimic, miR-99b-5p mimic or miR-96-5p antagomir downregulates HIF1Î±, PI3KÎ², mTOR, IGFBP2 but upregulates MAPKAPK2, subsequently reducing cell proliferation and sensitizing docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in PCa cells. These results suggest that miRNA-mRNA regulatory network plays a critical role in AA PCa disparities, and targeting these core miRNA-mRNA pairings may reduce PCa aggressiveness and overcome the chemoresistance in AA patients.",-1
"Machine learning-based in-hospital mortality prediction of HIV/AIDS patients with Talaromyces marneffei infection in Guangxi, China","Objective:                    Talaromycosis is a serious regional disease endemic in Southeast Asia. In China, Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) infections is mainly concentrated in the southern region, especially in Guangxi, and cause considerable in-hospital mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Currently, the factors that influence in-hospital death of HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei infection are not completely clear. Existing machine learning techniques can be used to develop a predictive model to identify relevant prognostic factors to predict death and appears to be essential to reducing in-hospital mortality.              Methods:                    We prospectively enrolled HIV/AIDS patients with talaromycosis in the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning, Guangxi, from January 2012 to June 2019. Clinical features were selected and used to train four different machine learning models (logistic regression, XGBoost, KNN, and SVM) to predict the treatment outcome of hospitalized patients, and 30% internal validation was used to evaluate the performance of models. Machine learning model performance was assessed according to a range of learning metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool was used to explain the model.              Results:                    A total of 1927 HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei infection were included. The average in-hospital mortality rate was 13.3% (256/1927) from 2012 to 2019. The most common complications/coinfections were pneumonia (68.9%), followed by oral candida (47.5%), and tuberculosis (40.6%). Deceased patients showed higher CD4/CD8 ratios, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, creatinine levels, urea levels, uric acid (UA) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, total bilirubin levels, creatine kinase levels, white blood-cell counts (WBC) counts, neutrophil counts, procaicltonin levels and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower CD3+ T-cell count, CD8+ T-cell count, and lymphocyte counts, platelet (PLT), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), hemoglobin (Hb) levels than those of surviving patients. The predictive XGBoost model exhibited 0.71 sensitivity, 0.99 specificity, and 0.97 AUC in the training dataset, and our outcome prediction model provided robust discrimination in the testing dataset, showing an AUC of 0.90 with 0.69 sensitivity and 0.96 specificity. The other three models were ruled out due to poor performance. Septic shock and respiratory failure were the most important predictive features, followed by uric acid, urea, platelets, and the AST/ALT ratios.              Conclusion:                    The XGBoost machine learning model is a good predictor in the hospitalization outcome of HIV/AIDS patients with T. marneffei infection. The model may have potential application in mortality prediction and high-risk factor identification in the talaromycosis population.",-1
MicroRNA as a Potential Therapeutic Molecule in Cancer,"Small noncoding RNAs, as post-translational regulators of many target genes, are not only markers of neoplastic disease initiation and progression, but also markers of response to anticancer therapy. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified as biomarkers of drug resistance, and many have demonstrated the potential to sensitize cancer cells to therapy. Their properties of modulating the response of cells to therapy have made them a promising target for overcoming drug resistance. Several methods have been developed for the delivery of miRNAs to cancer cells, including introducing synthetic miRNA mimics, DNA plasmids containing miRNAs, and small molecules that epigenetically alter endogenous miRNA expression. The results of studies in animal models and preclinical studies for solid cancers and hematological malignancies have confirmed the effectiveness of treatment protocols using microRNA. Nevertheless, the use of miRNAs in anticancer therapy is not without limitations, including the development of a stable nanoconstruct, delivery method choices, and biodistribution. The aim of this review was to summarize the role of miRNAs in cancer treatment and to present new therapeutic concepts for these molecules. Supporting anticancer therapy with microRNA molecules has been verified in numerous clinical trials, which shows great potential in the treatment of cancer.",-1
Spatiotemporal neural network with attention mechanism for El NiÃ±o forecasts,"To learn spatiotemporal representations and anomaly predictions from geophysical data, we propose STANet, a spatiotemporal neural network with a trainable attention mechanism, and apply it to El NiÃ±o predictions for long-lead forecasts. The STANet makes two critical architectural improvements: it learns spatial features globally by expanding the network's receptive field and encodes long-term sequential features with visual attention using a stateful long-short term memory network. The STANet conducts multitask learning of Nino3.4 index prediction and calendar month classification for predicted indices. In a comparison of the proposed STANet performance with the state-of-the-art model, the accuracy of the 12-month forecast lead correlation coefficient was improved by 5.8% and 13% for Nino3.4 index prediction and corresponding temporal classification, respectively. Furthermore, the spatially attentive regions for the strong El NiÃ±o events displayed spatial relationships consistent with the revealed precursor for El NiÃ±o occurrence, indicating that the proposed STANet provides good understanding of the spatiotemporal behavior of global sea surface temperature and oceanic heat content for El NiÃ±o evolution.",-1
Deep learning and cognitive science,"In recent years, the family of algorithms collected under the term ""deep learning"" has revolutionized artificial intelligence, enabling machines to reach human-like performances in many complex cognitive tasks. Although deep learning models are grounded in the connectionist paradigm, their recent advances were basically developed with engineering goals in mind. Despite of their applied focus, deep learning models eventually seem fruitful for cognitive purposes. This can be thought as a kind of biological exaptation, where a physiological structure becomes applicable for a function different from that for which it was selected. In this paper, it will be argued that it is time for cognitive science to seriously come to terms with deep learning, and we try to spell out the reasons why this is the case. First, the path of the evolution of deep learning from the connectionist project is traced, demonstrating the remarkable continuity, and the differences as well. Then, it will be considered how deep learning models can be useful for many cognitive topics, especially those where it has achieved performance comparable to humans, from perception to language. It will be maintained that deep learning poses questions that cognitive sciences should try to answer. One of such questions is the reasons why deep convolutional models that are disembodied, inactive, unaware of context, and static, are by far the closest to the patterns of activation in the brain visual system.",-1
Degree of Blood Pressure Control and Incident Diabetes Mellitus in Chinese Adults With Hypertension,"Background The association between blood pressure (BP) control and incident diabetes mellitus remains unknown. We aim to investigate the association between degree of time-averaged on-treatment systolic blood pressure (SBP) control and incident diabetes mellitus in hypertensive adults. Methods and Results A total of 14 978 adults with hypertension without diabetes mellitus at baseline were included from the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial). Participants were randomized double-masked to daily enalapril 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. BP measurements were taken every 3 months after randomization. The primary outcome was incident diabetes mellitus, defined as physician-diagnosed diabetes mellitus, or use of glucose-lowering drugs during follow-up, or fasting glucose â?26 mg/dL at the exit visit. Over a median of 4.5 years, a significantly higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus was found in participants with time-averaged on-treatment SBP 130 to <140 mm Hg (10.3% versus 7.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15â?.64), compared with those with SBP 120 to <130 mm Hg. Moreover, the risk of incident diabetes mellitus increased by 24% (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00â?.53) and the incidence of regression to normal fasting glucose (<100 mg/dL) decreased by 29% (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57â?.89) in participants with intermediate BP control (SBP/diastolic blood pressure, 130 to <140 and/or 80 to <90 mm Hg), compared with those with a tight BP control of <130/<80 mm Hg. Similar results were found when the time-averaged BP were calculated using the BP measurements during the first 6- or 24-month treatment period, or in the analysis using propensity scores. Conclusions In this non-diabetic, hypertensive population, SBP control in the range of 120 to <130 mm Hg, compared with the 130 to <140 mm Hg, was associated with a lower risk of incident diabetes mellitus.",-1
CircCCDC91 regulates chicken skeletal muscle development by sponging miR-15 family via activating IGF1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) has been reported in various tissues of animals and associated with multiple biological processes. From our previous sequencing data, we found a novel circRNA, circCCDC91 which was generated from exon 2 to 8 of the CCDC91 gene. We observed that circCCDC91 was differentially expressed in the chicken breast muscle among 4 different embryonic developmental time points (embryonic day 10 [E10], E13, E16, and E19). Therefore, we assumed that circCCDC91 have a potential function in chicken skeletal muscle development. In this study, we firstly verify the annular structure and expression pattern of circCCDC91, and further investigate on whether circCCDC91 could promote chicken skeletal development. Mechanistically, circCCDC91 could absorb miR-15a, miR-15b-5p, and miR-15c-5p to modulate the expression of Insulin receptor substrate1 (IRS1), as well as activate insulin-1ike growth factor 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (IGF1-PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. In addition, circCCDC91 could rescue skeletal muscle atrophy by activating IGF1-PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, the findings in this study revealed that the newly identified circCCDC91 promotes myoblasts proliferation and differentiation, and alleviates skeletal muscle atrophy by directly binding to miR-15 family via activating IGF1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in chicken.",-1
Computational prediction of protein functional sites-Applications in biotechnology and biomedicine,"There are many computational approaches for predicting protein functional sites based on different sequence and structural features. These methods are essential to cope with the sequence deluge that is filling databases with uncharacterized protein sequences. They complement the more expensive and time-consuming experimental approaches by pointing them to possible candidate positions. In many cases they are jointly used to characterize the functional sites in proteins of biotechnological and biomedical interest and eventually modify them for different purposes. There is a clear trend towards approaches based on machine learning and those using structural information, due to the recent developments in these areas. Nevertheless, ""classic"" methods based on sequence and evolutionary features are still playing an important role as these features are strongly related to functionality. In this review, the main approaches for predicting general functional sites in a protein are discussed, with a focus on sequence-based approaches.",-1
Circ_0088036 facilitates the proliferation and inflammation and inhibits the apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes through targeting miR-326/FZD4 axis in rheumatoid arthritis,"Background:                    The function and pathological significance of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are barely known. Here, we explored the role of circ_0088036 in RA progression and its associated mechanism.              Methods:                    The synovial lining layer tissues of RA patients and non-RA control patients were collected for clinical study in vivo, and tumour necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±)-induced RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs) were used for the experiments in vitro. Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to analyze the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were performed to verify the target interaction between microRNA-326 (miR-326) and circ_0088036 or frizzled class receptor 4 (FZD4).              Results:                    Circ_0088036 expression was elevated in the synovial lining layer tissues of RA patients and TNF-Î±-treated RA-FLSs. Circ_0088036 interference largely reversed TNF-Î±-induced proliferation and inflammation in RA-FLSs. The interaction between circ_0088036 and miR-326 was verified, and miR-326 silencing largely reversed circ_0088036 knockdown-mediated effects in TNF-Î±-treated RA-FLSs. MiR-326 bound to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of FZD4 in RA-FLSs. FZD4 overexpression largely diminished miR-326 accumulation-mediated influences in TNF-Î±-treated RA-FLSs. Circ_0088036 could up-regulate FZD4 by sponging miR-326 in RA-FLSs.              Conclusion:                    Circ_0088036 contributed to TNF-Î±-induced RA progression partly by targeting miR-326/FZD4 signalling.",-1
Current concepts in treating mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease,"Impairment in various aspects of cognition is recognized as an important non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) is common in non-demented PD patients and is often associated with severity of motor symptoms, disease duration and increasing age. Further, PD-MCI can have a significant negative effect on performance of daily life activities and may be a harbinger of development of PD dementia. Thus, there is significant interest in developing therapeutic strategies to ameliorate cognitive deficits in PD and improve cognitive functioning of PD patients. However, due to significant questions that remain regarding the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD, remediation of cognitive dysfunction in PD has proven difficult. In this paper, we will focus on PD-MCI and will review some of the current therapeutic approaches being taken to try to improve cognitive functioning in patients with PD-MCI.",-1
Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the testis: a rare presentation,"A man in his mid-70s presented with a lump in his left testicle. He had previously been treated for prostate cancer with radical radiotherapy. He was on treatment for hypertension and type 2 diabetes. An ultrasound of the testes demonstrated a solid intratesticular mass for which he underwent left orchidectomy. Histology from the orchidectomy was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), positive for cytokeratin (CK) 5/6 and p63. A positron emission tomogram (PET) scan was clear of any metastatic disease. His surveillance CT, done at 12 months, revealed mediastinal, abdominal and hilar adenopathy. Biopsy of hilar lymph nodes showed SCC and this was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient died after 18 months. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of metastatic SCC of testes with extensive spread and with platinum-refractory disease.",-1
E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks for data-efficient and accurate interatomic potentials,"This work presents Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), an E(3)-equivariant neural network approach for learning interatomic potentials from ab-initio calculations for molecular dynamics simulations. While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.",-1
The effectiveness of behavioral economics-informed interventions on physician behavioral change: A systematic literature review,"Objective:                    Interventions informed by behavioral economics have the potential to change behaviors governed by underlying cognitive biases. This has been explored extensively for various use in healthcare including changing patient behavior and, more recently, physician behavior. We aimed to systematically review the literature on the use and effectiveness of behavioral economics-informed interventions in changing physician behavior.              Method:                    We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, EBM Reviews, PsychINFO, EconLit, Business Source Complete and Web of Science for peer-reviewed studies published in English that examined the effectiveness of behavioral economics-informed interventions on physician behavioral change. We included studies of physicians in all care settings and specialties and all types of objectively measured behavioral outcomes. The reporting quality of included studies was appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool.              Results:                    We screened 6,439 studies and included 17 studies that met our criteria, involving at least 9,834 physicians. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States, published between 2014 and 2018, and were in the patient safety and quality domain. Reporting quality of included studies included strong (n = 7), moderate (n = 6) and weak (n = 4). Changing default settings and providing social reference points were the most widely studied interventions, with these studies consistently demonstrating their effectiveness in changing physician behavior despite differences in implementation methods among studies. Prescribing behavior was most frequently targeted in included studies, with consistent effectiveness of studied interventions.              Conclusion:                    Changing default settings and providing social reference points were the most frequently studied and consistently effective interventions in changing physician behavior towards guideline-concordant practices. Additional theory-informed research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of these interventions to guide implementation.",-1
Plasmodium falciparum LipB mutants display altered redox and carbon metabolism in asexual stages and cannot complete sporogony in Anopheles mosquitoes,"Malaria is still one of the most important global infectious diseases. Emergence of drug resistance and a shortage of new efficient antimalarials continue to hamper a malaria eradication agenda. Malaria parasites are highly sensitive to changes in the redox environment. Understanding the mechanisms regulating parasite redox could contribute to the design of new drugs. Malaria parasites have a complex network of redox regulatory systems housed in their cytosol, in their mitochondrion and in their plastid (apicoplast). While the roles of enzymes of the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways in parasite survival have been explored, the antioxidant role of Î±-lipoic acid (LA) produced in the apicoplast has not been tested. To take a first step in teasing a putative role of LA in redox regulation, we analysed a mutant Plasmodium falciparum (3D7 strain) lacking the apicoplast lipoic acid protein ligase B (lipB) known to be depleted of LA. Our results showed a change in expression of redox regulators in the apicoplast and the cytosol. We further detected a change in parasite central carbon metabolism, with lipB deletion resulting in changes to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. Further, in another Plasmodium cell line (NF54), deletion of lipB impacted development in the mosquito, preventing the detection of infectious sporozoite stages. While it is not clear at this point if the observed phenotypes are linked, these findings flag LA biosynthesis as an important subject for further study in the context of redox regulation in asexual stages, and point to LipB as a potential target for the development of new transmission drugs.",-1
West Nile Virus Neuroinfection in Humans: Peripheral Biomarkers of Neuroinflammation and Neuronal Damage,"Among emerging arthropod-borne viruses (arbovirus), West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that can be associated with severe neuroinvasive infections in humans. In 2018, the European WNV epidemic resulted in over 2000 cases, representing the most important arboviral epidemic in the European continent. Characterization of inflammation and neuronal biomarkers released during WNV infection, especially in the context of neuronal impairments, could provide insight into the development of predictive tools that could be beneficial for patient outcomes. We first analyzed the inflammatory signature in the serum of WNV-infected mice and found increased concentrations of several inflammatory cytokines. We next analyzed serum and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) samples from a cohort of patients infected by WNV between 2018 and 2019 in Hungary to quantify a large panel of inflammatory cytokines and neurological factors. We found higher levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL4, IL6, and IL10) and neuronal factors (e.g., BDNF, GFAP, MIF, TDP-43) in the sera of WNV-infected patients with neuroinvasive disease. Furthermore, the serum inflammatory profile of these patients persisted for several weeks after initial infection, potentially leading to long-term sequelae and having a deleterious effect on brain neurovasculature. This work suggests that early signs of increased serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and neuronal factors could be a signature underlying the development of severe neurological impairments. Biomarkers could play an important role in patient monitoring to improve care and prevent undesirable outcomes.",-1
Turning Failures into Applications: The Problem of Protein ÎÎG Prediction,"After nearly two decades of research in the field of computational methods based on machine learning and knowledge-based potentials for ÎG and ÎÎG prediction upon variations, we now realize that all the approaches are poorly performing when tested on specific cases and that there is large space for improvement. Why this is so? Is it wrong the underlying assumption that experimental protein thermodynamics in solution reflects the thermodynamics of a single protein? Both machine learning and knowledge-based computational methods are rigorous and we know the solid theory behind. We are now in a critical situation, which suggests that predictions of protein instability upon variation should be considered with care. In the following, we will show how to cope with the problem of understanding which protein positions may be of interest for biotechnological and biomedical purposes. By applying a consensus procedure, we indicate possible strategies for the result interpretation.",-1
TLR2 and TLR4 in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis: the environment takes a toll on the gut,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable, devastating disorder that is characterized by pathological protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. In recent years, growing evidence has implicated the gut environment and the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis and progression of PD, especially in a subset of people who exhibit prodromal gastrointestinal dysfunction. Specifically, perturbations of gut homeostasis are hypothesized to contribute to Î±-synuclein aggregation in enteric neurons, which may spread to the brain over decades and eventually result in the characteristic central nervous system manifestations of PD, including neurodegeneration and motor impairments. However, the mechanisms linking gut disturbances and Î±-synuclein aggregation are still unclear. A plethora of research indicates that toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4, are critical mediators of gut homeostasis. Alongside their established role in innate immunity throughout the body, studies are increasingly demonstrating that TLR2 and TLR4 signalling shapes the development and function of the gut and the enteric nervous system. Notably, TLR2 and TLR4 are dysregulated in patients with PD, and may thus be central to early gut dysfunction in PD. To better understand the putative contribution of intestinal TLR2 and TLR4 dysfunction to early Î±-synuclein aggregation and PD, we critically discuss the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in normal gut function as well as evidence for altered TLR2 and TLR4 signalling in PD, by reviewing clinical, animal model and in vitro research. Growing evidence on the immunological aetiology of Î±-synuclein aggregation is also discussed, with a focus on the interactions of Î±-synuclein with TLR2 and TLR4. We propose a conceptual model of PD pathogenesis in which microbial dysbiosis alters the permeability of the intestinal barrier as well as TLR2 and TLR4 signalling, ultimately leading to a positive feedback loop of chronic gut dysfunction promoting Î±-synuclein aggregation in enteric and vagal neurons. In turn, Î±-synuclein aggregates may then migrate to the brain via peripheral nerves, such as the vagal nerve, to contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration typically associated with PD.",-1
Type 1 diabetes related to immune checkpoint inhibitors,"Type 1 diabetes, in part, has been recently reported as a side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The frequency of type 1 diabetes related to ICIs is estimated to be â?.5%. However, type 1 diabetes related to ICIs often presents with diabetic ketoacidosis or ketosis within approximately 2 weeks after hyperglycemic symptoms, such as dry mouth, polydipsia, and polyuria, necessitating urgent diagnosis and insulin treatment. Endogenous insulin secretion is depleted within 3 weeks of the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the positive rate for islet-related autoantibodies has been shown to vary from 5% to 50%, and exocrine pancreatic enzyme levels are mildly increased. Thus, the clinical course of type 1 diabetes associated with ICIs is similar to that of fulminant type 1 diabetes. In this review, we describe the clinical features of type 1 diabetes associated with ICIs.",-1
CircRbms1 knockdown alleviates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury via regulating the miR-742-3p/FOXO1 axis,"Background:                    Circular RNA (circRNA) has been shown to play an important role in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). However, the role of circRbms1 in MI progression remains unclear.              Methods:                    An MI mouse model was constructed in vivo, and cardiomyocytes were cultured under hypoxia condition to induce a cardiomyocyte injury model in vitro. The expression levels of circRbms1, microRNA (miR)-742-3p, and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry. Meanwhile, western blot analysis was used to examine the protein levels of apoptosis markers and FOXO1. Additionally, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down assay, and RIP assay were employed to verify the interactions between miR-742-3p and circRbms1 or FOXO1.              Results:                    CircRbms1 was upregulated in the heart tissues of MI mice and hypoxia-induced cardiomyocytes. Hypoxia induced cardiomyocyte injury by suppressing cell viability, migration, and invasion, and promoting apoptosis. Function experiments showed that circRbms1 overexpression aggravated hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury, while its silencing relieved cardiomyocyte injury induced by hypoxia. Furthermore, circRbms1 sponged miR-742-3p. MiR-742-3p overexpression alleviated hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury, and its inhibitor reversed the suppressive effect of circRbms1 silencing on hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Further experiments showed that FOXO1 was a target of miR-742-3p, and its expression was positively regulated by circRbms1. The inhibitory effect of miR-742-3p on hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury was reversed by FOXO1 overexpression.              Conclusion:                    CircRbms1 regulated the miR-742-3p/FOXO1 axis to mediate hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury, suggesting that circRbms1 might be an effective target for MI treatment.",-1
Improved housing versus usual practice for additional protection against clinical malaria in The Gambia (RooPfs): a household-randomised controlled trial,"Background:                    In malaria-endemic areas, residents of modern houses have less malaria than those living in traditional houses. We aimed to assess whether children in The Gambia received an incremental benefit from improved housing, where current best practice of insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children younger than 5 years, and prompt treatment against clinical malaria was in place.              Methods:                    In this randomised controlled study, 800 households with traditional thatched-roofed houses were randomly selected from 91 villages in the Upper River Region of The Gambia. Within each village, equal numbers of houses were randomly allocated to the control and intervention groups using a sampling frame. Houses in the intervention group were modified with metal roofs and screened doors and windows, whereas houses in the control group received no modifications. In each group, clinical malaria in children aged 6 months to 13 years was monitored by active case detection over 2 years (2016-17). We did monthly collections from indoor light traps to estimate vector densities. Primary endpoints were the incidence of clinical malaria in study children with more than 50% of observations each year and household vector density. The trial is registered at ISRCTN02622179.              Findings:                    In June, 2016, 785 houses had one child each recruited into the study (398 in unmodified houses and 402 in modified houses). 26 children in unmodified houses and 28 children in modified houses did not have at least 50% of visits in a year and so were excluded from analysis. 38 children in unmodified houses were recruited after study commencement, as were 21 children in modified houses, meaning 410 children in unmodified houses and 395 in modified houses were included in the parasitological analyses. At the end of the study, 659 (94%) of 702 children were reported to have slept under an insecticide-treated net; 662 (88%) of 755 children lived in houses that received indoor residual spraying; and 151 (90%) of 168 children younger than 5 years had seasonal malaria chemoprevention. Incidence of clinical malaria was 0Â·12 episodes per child-year in children in the unmodified houses and 0Â·20 episodes per child-year in the modified houses (unadjusted incidence rate ratio [RR] 1Â·68 [95% CI 1Â·11-2Â·55], p=0Â·014). Household vector density was 3Â·30 Anopheles gambiae per house per night in the unmodified houses compared with 3Â·60 in modified houses (unadjusted RR 1Â·28 [0Â·87-1Â·89], p=0Â·21).              Interpretation:                    Improved housing did not provide protection against clinical malaria in this area of low seasonal transmission with high coverage of insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and seasonal malaria chemoprevention.

ResNet-50 for 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Automated Diagnosis,"Nowadays, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medical diagnosis has attracted major attention within both the academic literature and industrial sector. AI would include deep learning (DL) models, where these models have been achieving a spectacular performance in healthcare applications. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020 there were around 25.6 million people who died from cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Thus, this paper aims to shad the light on cardiology since it is widely considered as one of the most important in medicine field. The paper develops an efficient DL model for automatic diagnosis of 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals with 27 classes, including 26 types of CVD and a normal sinus rhythm. The proposed model consists of Residual Neural Network (ResNet-50). An experimental work has been conducted using combined public databases from the USA, China, and Germany as a proof-of-concept. Simulation results of the proposed model have achieved an accuracy of 97.63% and a precision of 89.67%. The achieved results are validated against the actual values in the recent literature.",-1
"Efficacy of interceptorÂ® G2, a long-lasting insecticide mixture net treated with chlorfenapyr and alpha-cypermethrin against Anopheles funestus: experimental hut trials in north-eastern Tanzania","Background:                    The effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN), the primary method for preventing malaria in Africa, is compromised by evolution and spread of pyrethroid resistance. Further gains require new insecticides with novel modes of action. Chlorfenapyr is a pyrrole insecticide that disrupts mitochrondrial function and confers no cross-resistance to neurotoxic insecticides. InterceptorÂ® G2 LN (IG2) is an insecticide-mixture LLIN, which combines wash-resistant formulations of chlorfenapyr and the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin. The objective was to determine IG2 efficacy under controlled household-like conditions for personal protection and control of wild, pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles funestus mosquitoes.              Methods:                    Experimental hut trials tested IG2 efficacy against two positive controls-a chlorfenapyr-treated net and a standard alpha-cypermethrin LLIN, Interceptor LN (IG1)-consistent with World Health Organization (WHO) evaluation guidelines. Mosquito mortality, blood-feeding inhibition, personal protection, repellency and insecticide-induced exiting were recorded after zero and 20 washing cycles. The trial was repeated and analysed using multivariate and meta-analysis.              Results:                    In the two trials held in NE Tanzania, An. funestus mortality was 2.27 (risk ratio 95% CI 1.13-4.56) times greater with unwashed Interceptor G2 than with unwashed Interceptor LN (p = 0.012). There was no significant loss in mortality with IG2 between 0 and 20 washes (1.04, 95% CI 0.83-1.30, p = 0.73). Comparison with chlorfenapyr treated net indicated that most mortality was induced by the chlorfenapyr component of IG2 (0.96, CI 0.74-1.23), while comparison with Interceptor LN indicated blood-feeding was inhibited by the pyrethroid component of IG2 (IG2: 0.70, CI 0.44-1.11 vs IG1: 0.61, CI 0.39-0.97). Both insecticide components contributed to exiting from the huts but the contributions were heterogeneous between trials (heterogeneity Q = 36, P = 0.02). WHO susceptibility tests with pyrethroid papers recorded 44% survival in An. funestus.              Conclusions:                    The high mortality recorded by IG2 against pyrethroid-resistant An. funestus provides first field evidence of high efficacy against this primary, anthropophilic, malaria vector.",-1
Novel Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors to Target Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,"This paper reports on a novel series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) potentially useful for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The newly designed and synthesized compounds are structurally related to nilotinib (NIL), a second-generation oral TKI, and to a series of imatinib (IM)-based TKIs, previously reported by our research group, these latter characterized by a hybrid structure between TKIs and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitors. The enzyme HO-1 was selected as an additional target since it is overexpressed in many cases of drug resistance, including CML. The new derivatives 1a-j correctly tackle the chimeric protein BCR-ABL. Therefore, the inhibition of TK was comparable to or higher than NIL and IM for many novel compounds, while most of the new analogs showed only moderate potency against HO-1. Molecular docking studies revealed insights into the binding mode with BCR-ABL and HO-1, providing a structural explanation for the differential activity. Cytotoxicity on K562 CML cells, both NIL-sensitive and -resistant, was evaluated. Notably, some new compounds strongly reduced the viability of K562 sensitive cells.",-1
How Pyroptosis Contributes to Inflammation and Fibroblast-Macrophage Cross-Talk in Rheumatoid Arthritis,"About thirty years ago, a new form of pro-inflammatory lytic cell death was observed and termed pyroptosis. Only in 2015, gasdermins were defined as molecules that create pores at the plasma membrane and drive pyroptosis. Today, we know that gasdermin-mediated death is an important antimicrobial defence mechanism in bacteria, yeast and mammals as it destroys the intracellular niche for pathogen replication. However, excessive and uncontrolled cell death also contributes to immunopathology in several chronic inflammatory diseases, including arthritis. In this review, we discuss recent findings where pyroptosis contributes to tissue damage and inflammation with a main focus on injury-induced and autoimmune arthritis. We also review novel functions and regulatory mechanisms of the pyroptotic executors gasdermins. Finally, we discuss possible models of how pyroptosis may contribute to the cross-talk between fibroblast and macrophages, and also how this cross-talk may regulate inflammation by modulating inflammasome activation and pyroptosis induction.",-1
Integrated Deadenylase Genetic Association Network and Transcriptome Analysis in Thoracic Carcinomas,"The poly(A) tail at the 3' end of mRNAs determines their stability, translational efficiency, and fate. The shortening of the poly(A) tail, and its efficient removal, triggers the degradation of mRNAs, thus, regulating gene expression. The process is catalyzed by a family of enzymes, known as deadenylases. As the dysregulation of gene expression is a hallmark of cancer, understanding the role of deadenylases has gained additional interest. Herein, the genetic association network shows that CNOT6 and CNOT7 are the most prevalent and most interconnected nodes in the equilibrated diagram. Subsequent silencing and transcriptomic analysis identifies transcripts possibly regulated by specific deadenylases. Furthermore, several gene ontologies are enriched by common deregulated genes. Given the potential concerted action and overlapping functions of deadenylases, we examined the effect of silencing a deadenylase on the remaining ones. Our results suggest that specific deadenylases target unique subsets of mRNAs, whilst at the same time, multiple deadenylases may affect the same mRNAs with overlapping functions.",-1
Therapeutic Strategies for Ovarian Cancer in Point of HGF/c-MET Targeting,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women and is regarded as one of the most difficult cancers to treat. Currently, studies are being conducted to develop therapeutic agents for effective treatment of ovarian cancer. In this review, we explain the properties of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) and how the signaling pathway of HGF/c-MET is activated in different cancers and involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis of ovarian cancer. We present the findings of clinical studies using small chemicals or antibodies targeting HGF/c-MET signaling in various cancer types, particularly in ovarian cancer. We also discuss that HGF/c-MET-targeted therapy, when combined with chemo drugs, could be an effective strategy for ovarian cancer therapeutics.",-1
Curcumin mitigates Cryptosporidium parvum infection through modulation of gut microbiota and innate immune-related genes in immunosuppressed neonatal mice,"Cryptosporidium parvum is a major cause of diarrheal disease in immature or weakened immune systems, mainly in infants and young children in resource-poor settings. Despite its high prevalence, fully effective and safe drugs for the treatment of C. parvum infections remain scarce, and there is no vaccine. Meanwhile, curcumin has shown protective effects against C. parvum infections. However, the mechanisms of action and relationship to the gut microbiota and innate immune responses are unclear. Immunosuppressed neonatal mice were infected with oocysts of C. parvum and either untreated or treated with a normal diet, curcumin or paromomycin. We found that curcumin stopped C. parvum oocysts shedding in the feces of infected immunosuppressed neonatal mice, prevented epithelial damage, and villi degeneration, as well as prevented recurrence of infection. Curcumin supplementation increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in mice infected with C. parvum as shown by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio, Prevotella, and Helicobacter was significantly associated with C. parvum infection inhibited by curcumin. Curcumin significantly (P < 0.01) suppressed IFN-Î³ and IL -18 gene expression levels in immunosuppressed neonatal C. parvum-infected mice. We demonstrate that the therapeutic effects curcumin are associated with alterations in the gut microbiota and innate immune-related genes, which may be linked to the anti-Cryptosporidium mechanisms of curcumin.",-1
Oxidative stress-related circulating miRNA-27a is a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with sepsis,"Background:                    Oxidative stress plays a critical role on the processes of sepsis, and several microRNAs have been identified that may regulate the occurrence of oxidative stress. However, the relation between oxidative stress-related microRNA 27a (miR-27a) and sepsis is unknown. The present study aimed to determine the value of circulating miR-27a for the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis.              Methods:                    This retrospective study included 23 patients with sepsis and 25 without sepsis treated at the emergency intensive care unit (EICU) or our institution between January 2019 and January 2020. Levels of circulating miR-27a and levels of oxidative stress-related indicators were measured and compared between sepsis and non-sepsis patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine diagnostic efficiency of miR-27a.              Results:                    Circulating miR-27a levels in sepsis patients were higher than those in non-sepsis patients (p < 0.05), and levels were significantly higher in patients that died than those that lived (p < 0.05). In patients with sepsis, circulating miR-27a level was positively correlated with serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level (rs = 0.529, p = 0.007), and negatively correlated with serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) level (rs = - 0.477, p = 0.016). No significant correlation was observed between circulating miR-27a and serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) in sepsis patients (rs = - 0.340, p = 0.096). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of miR-27a level for prediction of sepsis was 0.717 (p = 0.009) and for 28-day mortality was 0.739 (p = 0.003).              Conclusions:                    This study showed that circulating miR-27a level is correlated with oxidative stress and mortality in patients with sepsis, and may serve as a potential non-invasive molecular biomarker.",-1
Silencing of Ago-2 Interacting Protein SERBP1 Relieves KCC2 Repression by miR-92 in Neurons,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in modulating miRNA-mediated mRNA target repression. Argonaute2 (Ago2) is an essential component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that plays a central role in silencing mechanisms via small non-coding RNA molecules known as siRNAs and miRNAs. Small RNAs loaded into Argonaute proteins catalyze endoribonucleolytic cleavage of target RNAs or recruit factors responsible for translational silencing and mRNA target destabilization. In previous studies we have shown that KCC2, a neuronal Cl (-) extruding K (+) Cl (-) co-transporter 2, is regulated by miR-92 in neuronal cells. Searching for Ago2 partners by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis, we isolated among other proteins the Serpine mRNA binding protein 1 (SERBP1) from SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Exploring the role of SERBP1 in miRNA-mediated gene silencing in SH-SY5Y cells and primary hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that SERBP1 silencing regulates KCC2 expression through the 3' untranslated region (UTR). In addition, we found that SERBP1 as well as Ago2/miR-92 complex bind to KCC2 3'UTR. Finally, we demonstrated the attenuation of miR-92-mediated repression of KCC2 3'UTR by SERBP1 silencing. These findings advance our knowledge regarding the miR-92-mediated modulation of KCC2 translation in neuronal cells and highlight SERBP1 as a key component of this gene regulation.",-1
Correlation of serum vascular endothelial growth factor and cardiovascular risk factors on collateral formation in patients with acute coronary artery syndrome,"Coronary collaterals serve as an alternative source of blood flow in obstructive coronary heart disease. Coronary collateral development is induced by various angiogenic growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Cardiovascular risk factors strongly associated with coronary artery disease include age, sex, elevated serum cholesterol, disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, and elevated blood pressure. A better understanding of the effects of these cardiovascular risk factors and serum VEGF-A level on collateral recruitment is necessary for a better prognosis in coronary artery diseases and new insight for further therapeutic promotion of coronary collaterals.220 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography with a mean age of 61 Â± 9.83 were selected for the analysis. Two milliliters of blood were taken from the patients for analysis. The blood serum VEGF concentration was quantified via the ELISA method. Angiograms and other clinical reports were collected. Significant coronary artery disease was diagnosed in those with â?70% of stenosis in at least one of the coronary arteries. The angiographic and clinical data were documented. The collateral grading was done according to the Rentrop Scoring system. The serum vascular endothelial growth factor level was correlated with the collateral score and cardiovascular risk factors like age, sex, type II diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. An increase in the level of the collateral score was noted with an increase in the level of VEGF in blood serum. A significant association was founded between serum VEGF level and cardiovascular risk factors on collateral formation in patients with diabetes and hypertension.",-1
Endothelial cell-specific deletion of a microRNA accelerates atherosclerosis,"Background and aims:                    Chronic vascular endothelial inflammation predisposes to atherosclerosis; however, the cell-autonomous roles for endothelial-expressing microRNAs (miRNAs) are poorly understood in this process. MiR-181b is expressed in several cellular constituents relevant to lesion formation. The aim of this study is to examine the role of genetic deficiency of the miR-181b locus in endothelial cells during atherogenesis.              Methods and results:                    Using a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)-induced atherosclerosis mouse model, we demonstrated that endothelial cell (EC)-specific deletion of miR-181a2b2 significantly promoted atherosclerotic lesion formation, cell adhesion molecule expression, and the influx of lesional macrophages in the vessel wall. Yet, endothelium deletion of miR-181a2b2 did not affect body weight, lipid metabolism, anti-inflammatory Ly6Clow or the pro-inflammatory Ly6Cinterm and Ly6Chigh fractions in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators in both bone marrow (BM) and PBMCs. Mechanistically, bulk RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analysis of ECs enriched from the aortic arch intima, as well as single cell RNA-seq from atherosclerotic lesions, revealed that endothelial miR-181a2b2 serves as a critical regulatory hub in controlling endothelial inflammation, cell adhesion, cell cycle, and immune response during atherosclerosis.              Conclusions:                    Our study establishes that deficiency of a miRNA specifically in the vascular endothelium is sufficient to profoundly impact atherogenesis. Endothelial miR-181a2b2 deficiency regulates multiple key pathways related to endothelial inflammation, cell adhesion, cell cycle, and immune response involved in the development of atherosclerosis.",-1
Exploring BODIPY-Based Sensor for Imaging of Intracellular Microviscosity in Human Breast Cancer Cells,"BODIPY-based molecular rotors are highly attractive imaging tools for imaging intracellular microviscosity in living cells. In our study, we investigated the ability to detect the microviscosity of biological objects by using BDP-NO2 and BDP-H molecular rotors. We describe in detail the optical properties of BDP-NO2 and BDP-H molecular rotors in aqueous media with and without proteins, together with their accumulation dynamics and localization in live and fixed human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of these molecules to monitor microviscosity in the organelles of human breast cancer cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). We demonstrate that the BDP-NO2 molecular rotor aggregates in aqueous media and is incompatible with live cell imaging. The opposite effect is observed with BDP-H which preserves its stability in aqueous media, diffuses through the plasma membrane and accumulates in lipid droplets (LDs) and the cytosol of both live and fixed MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Finally, by utilizing BDP-H we demonstrate that LD microviscosity is significantly elevated in more malignant MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, as compared to MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that BDP-H is a water-compatible probe that can be successfully applied to measure microviscosity in the LDs of living cells.",-1
Gut microbiome alterations in hereditary angioedema,"Background:                    Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease with wide intra- and interindividual clinical variation. There are no reliable indicators available in clinical practice to predict the onset and severity of HAE. Uncovering the changes in the gut microbiota in HAE patients may offer insight into a missing piece of the pathogenesis and help explain the clinical heterogeneity.              Objective:                    Explore whether dysbiosis exists in patients with HAE and whether there are biomarkers to indicate the episodes.              Methods:                    Fecal samples and clinical data were collected from patients with C1-inhibitor-related HAE and their healthy family members. Patients were grouped on the basis of the most recent conditions of HAE episodes and major clinical manifestations. The gut microbiota was evaluated by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and analyzed for diversity.              Results:                    Microbial richness and diversity were significantly reduced among patients who had recent HAE attacks, especially for those presenting with abdominal symptoms (P = .003 and P = .048 compared with healthy controls and patients with no recent episodes, respectively). Decreased Firmicutes and increased Proteobacteria were found among the individuals with a recent episode, along with a marked increase of pathogenic bacteria on the basis of the predictive functional profiling. Dysbiosis was restored after regular use of danazol or tranexamic acid. A combined biomarker composed of Bifidobacterium, Lachnospira, Paraprevotella, Desulfovibrio, and Staphylococcus was proposed to detect the recent edema episodes.              Conclusion:                    We reported alterations of the gut microbiome in patients with HAE and explored the possible role of bacteria in the etiology of edema episodes, which may provide new clues for the prediction of disease course, clinical treatment, and therapeutic evaluation.",-1
[Application of TELSA structured education program in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus],"Objective: To evaluate the effect of TELSA structured education program in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in China. Methods: From January 2019 to January 2020, 64 adult T1DM patients who met the standard of entry and had the intention to participate in TELSA structured education program were selected from the outpatient of type 1 diabetes comprehensive management in the Second Xiangya Hospital as intervention group. A total of 64 patients matched by age and sex were enrolled as the control group. During the program, the intervention group lost 3 cases and the control group lost 4 cases. Finally, there were 61 effective samples in the intervention group and 60 effective samples in the control group. The patients in the control group were given face-to-face education by a T1DM educator for about 2 hours. The patients in the intervention group were intervened according to TELSA structured education program. The level of glycosylated hemoglobin, the frequency of hypoglycemia, self-management ability and quality of life were evaluated before intervention, 6 months after intervention and 12 months after intervention. Results: The ages of the intervention group and the control group were 30.0(22.0,43.5) and 29.5(22.3,42.5) (P>0.05), and the proportions of males were 47.54%(29 cases) and 45.00%(27 cases), respectively (P>0.05). There were interaction effects (P<0.05) on the level of glycosylated hemoglobin, self-management ability and quality of life in the two groups. At 6 and 12 months after intervention of TELSA structured education program, the level of glycosylated hemoglobin in the intervention group decreased from the baseline level (7.87Â±1.45)% to (7.23Â±1.06)% and (7.28Â±0.93)%, respectively, which was significantly lower than that in the control group at 6 months (7.72Â±1.20)% and at 12 months(7.76Â±1.24)% (all P<0.05). After TELSA structured education intervention, the scores of self-management scale for adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (SMOD-CA) in the intervention group showed an upward trend (P<0.001), and the scores of diabetes-specific quality of life scale (A-DQOL) showed a downward trend (P<0.001). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in the trend of scores in the control group (P=0.853 and 0.227). The comparison between groups at different time points showed that at 6 and 12 months after the intervention, the SMOD-CA scores of the patients in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.001), and the A-DQOL scores were lower than those in the control group (P<0.001). Conclusions: The TELSA structured education program can effectively ameliorate glycemic control, with the improvement of self-management ability and quality of life in adult T1DM patients.",-1
Network Blockchain Security Sharing Model Based on Fuzzy Logic,"In light of the continuous development of Internet technology, many problems involving network security based on the blockchain have also been observed gradually. In this paper, the existence forms of network security hazards based on the blockchain are explored to establish a network blockchain security sharing model based on fuzzy logic. In security sharing, network blockchains are often maintained by many parties. This poses new potential threats and challenges to privacy protection in these multiparty network blockchains. This paper proposes a research scheme for a network blockchain security sharing model based on fuzzy logic. The tampering of the protected network blockchain is prevented by blockchain, and the fuzzy logic algorithm is used to ensure its confidentiality. This solution allows the exchange in the protected network blockchain and the security of transaction information based on the fuzzy logic algorithm. According to the results of the experiments, this method can ensure security sharing of the network blockchain with high practicality and achieve the expected design effect.",-1
Increased dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is associated with anxiety in adolescent girls,"The pubertal period is a time of rapid increase in the incidence of anxiety disorders, and thus, pubertal hormones may play a role in the precipitation of anxious psychopathology. DHEA, a steroid hormone that surges in adolescence, has been previously linked to anxiety, although the direction of this effect has been mixed. Using a cross-sectional design in a sample of 286 adolescent girls, the present study examined associations between salivary DHEA concentrations and self-report and interview-based measures of anxiety while controlling for pubertal status, menarche status, assessment time of day, and other hormones including testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone. Increased salivary DHEA concentrations were associated with more self-reported anxiety symptoms, increased anxiety symptom counts based on clinical interview, and increased probability of an anxiety disorder. Out of all anxiety symptom domains examined, generalized anxiety disorder symptoms were the best predictor of salivary DHEA concentrations after controlling for pubertal development. Collectively, our findings suggest relevance for DHEA in the development of anxiety in the pubertal period, as well as a robust relationship between DHEA and emerging symptoms of pathological worry during adolescence. The present study underscores the importance of examining associations between DHEA concentrations and anxiety in longitudinal designs.",-1
Kaemperfol alleviates pyroptosis and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease via inhibiting p38MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway,"The study aims to investigate whether kaemperfol (KAE) inhibits microglia pyroptosis and subsequent neuroinflammatory response to exert neuroprotective effects, along with the underlying mechanisms. The results showed KAE could ameliorate the behavioral deficits of Parkinson's disease (PD) rats, inhibit the activation of microglia and astrocytes, reduce the loss of TH-positive neurons, down-regulate levels of pyroptosis-related NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), GasderminD-N Term (GSDMD-NT), caspase1, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC), interleukin (IL)-1Î², and IL-18, and decrease the levels of inflammatory molecules (inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-kappaB (p38MAPK/NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway molecules (p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK, NF-ÎºB, and p-NF-ÎºB) in the substantia nigra of PD rats. Further in vitro study indicated that KAE reversed the activation of BV2 cells and down-regulated the expressions of pyrolytic proteins, inflammatory mediators and key molecules in p38MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Collectively, KAE inhibits the microglia pyroptosis and subsequent neuroinflammatory response to exert neuroprotective effects on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 inflammatory cells through inhibiting p38MAPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.",-1
"Design, Cytotoxicity and Antiproliferative Activity of 4-Amino-5-methyl-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylates against MFC-7 and MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cell Lines","Novel 4-amino-thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylates substituted at the second position were prepared by cyclocondensation of 2-amino-3-cyano-thiophene and aryl nitriles in an acidic medium. The design of the target compounds was based on structural optimization. The derivatives thus obtained were tested in vitro against human and mouse cell lines. The examination of the compound effects on BLAB 3T3 and MFC-10A cells showed that they are safe, making them suitable for subsequent experiments to establish their antitumor activity. The photoirritancy factor of the compounds was calculated. Using the MTT test, the antiproliferative activity to MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines was estimated. The best antiproliferative effect in respect to the MCF-7 cell line revealed compound 2 with IC50 4.3 Â± 0.11 Âµg/mL (0.013 ÂµM). The highest selective index with respect to MCF-7 cells was shown by compound 3 (SI = 19.3), and to MDA-MB-231 cells by compound 2 (SI = 3.7). Based on energy analysis, the most stable conformers were selected and optimized by means of density functional theory (DFT). Ligand efficiency, ligand lipophilicity efficiency and the physicochemical parameters of the target 4-amino-thienopyrimidines were determined. The data obtained indicated that the lead compound among the tested substances is compound 2.",-1
Forkhead Domain Inhibitor-6 Suppresses Corneal Neovascularization and Subsequent Fibrosis After Alkali Burn in Rats,"Purpose:                    The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Forkhead Domain Inhibitor-6 (FDI-6) on regulating inflammatory corneal angiogenesis and subsequent fibrosis induced by alkali burn.              Methods:                    A corneal alkali burn model was established in Sprague Dawley rats using NaOH and the rat eyes were topically treated with FDI-6 (40 ÂµM) or a control vehicle four times daily for 7 days. Corneal neovascularization, inflammation and epithelial defects were observed on days 1, 4, and 7 under a slit lamp microscope after corneal alkali burn. Analysis of angiogenesis-, inflammation-, and fibrosis-related indicators was conducted on day 7. Murine macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) and mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cells (MRMECs) were used to examine the effects of FDI-6 on inflammatory angiogenesis in vitro.              Results:                    Topical delivery of FDI-6 significantly attenuated alkali burn-induced corneal inflammation, neovascularization, and fibrosis. FDI-6 suppressed the expression of angiogenic factors (vascular epidermal growth factor, CD31, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and endothelial NO synthase), fibrotic factors (Î±-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin), and pro-inflammatory factor interleukin-6 in alkali-injured corneas. FDI-6 downregulated the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3, and vascular endothelial growth factor in RAW264.7 cells and inhibited the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of MRMECs in vitro.              Conclusions:                    FDI-6 can attenuate corneal neovascularization, inflammation, and fibrosis in alkali-injured corneas.",-1
(De)stabilization of Alpha-Synuclein Fibrillary Aggregation by Charged and Uncharged Surfactants,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. An important hallmark of PD involves the pathological aggregation of proteins in structures known as Lewy bodies. The major component of these proteinaceous inclusions is alpha (Î±)-synuclein. In different conditions, Î±-synuclein can assume conformations rich in either Î±-helix or Î²-sheets. The mechanisms of Î±-synuclein misfolding, aggregation, and fibrillation remain unknown, but it is thought that Î²-sheet conformation of Î±-synuclein is responsible for its associated toxic mechanisms. To gain fundamental insights into the process of Î±-synuclein misfolding and aggregation, the secondary structure of this protein in the presence of charged and non-charged surfactant solutions was characterized. The selected surfactants were (anionic) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), (cationic) cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), and (uncharged) octyl Î²-D-glucopyranoside (OG). The effect of surfactants in Î±-synuclein misfolding was assessed by ultra-structural analyses, in vitro aggregation assays, and secondary structure analyses. The Î±-synuclein aggregation in the presence of negatively charged SDS suggests that SDS-monomer complexes stimulate the aggregation process. A reduction in the electrostatic repulsion between N- and C-terminal and in the hydrophobic interactions between the NAC (non-amyloid beta component) region and the C-terminal seems to be important to undergo aggregation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements show that Î²-sheet structures comprise the assembly of the fibrils.",-1
Cuckoo Search-Based Optimization for Cancer Classification: A New Hybrid Approach,"The design of an optimal framework for the prediction of cancer from high-dimensional and imbalanced microarray data is a challenging job in the fields of bioinformatics and machine learning. There are so many techniques for dimensionality reduction, but it is unclear which of these techniques performs best with different classifiers and datasets. This article focused on the independent component analysis (ICA) features (genes) extraction method for NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classification of microarray data, because ICA perfectly takes out an independent component from the datasets that satisfy the classification criteria of the NB classifier. A novel hybrid method based on a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm is proposed in this article for resolving optimization problems of ICA extracted genes. The cuckoo search (CS) algorithm and artificial bee colony (ABC) for finding the best subset of features to increase the performance of ICA for the NB classifier is designed and executed. According to our investigation, the CS-ABC with ICA was implemented for the first time to resolve the dimensionality reduction problem in high-dimensional microarray biomedical datasets. The CS algorithm improved the local search process of the ABC algorithm, and then the hybrid algorithm CS-ABC provided better optimal gene sets that improved the classification accuracy of the NB classifier. The experimental comparison shows that the CS-ABC approach with the ICA algorithm performs a deeper search in the iterative process, which can avoid premature convergence and produce better results compared with the previously published feature selection algorithm for the NB classifier.",-1
Plasma Lipid Profile and Intestinal Microflora in Pregnancy Women With Hypothyroidism and Their Correlation With Pregnancy Outcomes,"Objective:                    To investigate the lipid profiles and intestinal microflora in pregnant patients with hypothyroidism and their correlation with pregnancy outcomes.              Methods:                    In total, 27 pregnant women with hypothyroidism (study case) and 28 normal pregnant women (control group) were enrolled in this study. The lipid profiles and intestinal microflora in the two groups were compared using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, respectively. The association among the differential metabolites, intestinal microflora, serological indicators and pregnancy outcomes was further analyzed.              Results:                    Patients in study case had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (P = 0.025) and lower birth weight (P=0.005) than the control group. A total of 42 differential lipid metabolites and 7 enrichment KEGG pathways were obtained between the two groups (VIP â?1, P < 0.05). Ten lipid metabolites can be used as characteristic metabolites of study case, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and sphingomyelin (SM). The richness and diversity of intestinal microflora in study case were lower than those in the control group (P>0.05). LEfSe analysis revealed that patients in study case had higher abundance of Prevotella and Haemophilus and lower abundance of Blautia than the control group (P < 0.05). Blautia was positively correlated with SM and negatively correlated with PC and PE; the CRP level and Prevotella were positively correlated; the neonatal weight and PC level were negatively correlated (P < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    The lipid profile and intestinal microflora of pregnant women with hypothyroidism significantly differed from those of normal pregnant women and were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The interaction between lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora may be a potential target for further studies investigating the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism during pregnancy.",-1
"""Kankasha"" in Kassala: A prospective observational cohort study of the clinical characteristics, epidemiology, genetic origin, and chronic impact of the 2018 epidemic of Chikungunya virus infection in Kassala, Sudan","Background:                    The public health impact of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is often underestimated. Usually considered a mild condition of short duration, recent outbreaks have reported greater incidence of severe illness, fatality, and longer-term disability. In 2018/19, Eastern Sudan experienced the largest epidemic of CHIKV in Africa to date, affecting an estimated 487,600 people. Known locally as Kankasha, this study examines clinical characteristics, risk factors, and phylogenetics of the epidemic in Kassala City.              Methodology/principal findings:                    A prospective cohort of 102 adults and 40 children presenting with chikungunya-like illness were enrolled at Kassala Teaching Hospital in October 2018. Clinical information, socio-demographic data, and sera samples were analysed to confirm diagnosis, characterise illness, and identify viral strain. CHIKV infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in 84.5% (120/142) of participants. Nine (7.5%) CHIKV-positive participants had concurrent Dengue virus (DENV) infection; 34/118 participants (28.8%) had a positive Rapid Diagnostic Test for Plasmodium falciparum; six (5.0%) had haemorrhagic symptoms including two children with life-threatening bleeding. One CHIKV-positive participant died with acute renal injury. Age was not associated with severity of illness although CHIKV-infected participants were younger (p = 0.003). Two to four months post-illness, 63% of adults available for follow-up (30) were still experiencing arthralgia in one or more joints, and 11% remained moderately disabled on Rapid3 assessment. Phylogenetic analysis showed all CHIKV sequences from this study belonged to a single clade within the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype. History of contact with an infected person was the only factor associated with infection (p = 0.01), and likely related to being in the same vector environment.              Conclusions/significance:                    Vulnerability to CHIKV remains in Kassala and elsewhere in Sudan due to widespread Aedes aegypti presence and mosquito-fostering household water storage methods. This study highlights the importance of increasing awareness of the severity and impact of CHIKV outbreaks, and the need for urgent actions to reduce transmission risk in households.",-1
Inhibition of defensin A and cecropin A responses to dengue virus 1 infection in Aedes aegypti,"Introduction:                    It is essential to determine the interactions between viruses and mosquitoes to diminish dengue viral transmission. These interactions constitute a very complex system of highly regulated pathways known as the innate immune system of the mosquito, which produces antimicrobial peptides that act as effector molecules against bacterial and fungal infections. There is less information about such effects on virus infections.              Objective:                    To determine the expression of two antimicrobial peptide genes, defensin A and cecropin A, in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with DENV-1.              Materials and methods:                    We used the F1 generation of mosquitoes orally infected with DENV-1 and real-time PCR analysis to determine whether the defensin A and cecropin A genes played a role in controlling DENV-1 replication in Ae. aegypti. As a reference, we conducted similar experiments with the bacteria Escherichia coli.              Results:                    Basal levels of defensin A and cecropin A mRNA were expressed in uninfected mosquitoes at different times post-blood feeding. The infected mosquitoes experienced reduced expression of these mRNA by at least eightfold when compared to uninfected control mosquitoes at all times post-infection. In contrast with the behavior of DENV-1, results showed that bacterial infection produced up-regulation of defensin and cecropin genes; however, the induction of transcripts occurred at later times (15 days).              Conclusion:                    DENV-1 virus inhibited the expression of defensin A and cecropin A genes in a wild Ae. aegypti population from Venezuela.",-1
Artificial Intelligence Meets Neuro-Ophthalmology,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have provided ophthalmologists with fast, accurate, and automated means for diagnosing and treating ocular conditions, paving the way to a modern and scalable eye care system. Compared to other ophthalmic disciplines, neuro-ophthalmology has, until recently, not benefitted from significant advances in the area of artificial intelligence. In this narrative review, we summarize and discuss recent advancements utilizing artificial intelligence for the detection of structural and functional optic nerve head abnormalities, and ocular movement disorders in neuro-ophthalmology.",-1
"Metabolic Abnormalities in Normal Weight Children Are Associated with Increased Visceral Fat Accumulation, Elevated Plasma Endotoxin Levels and a Higher Monosaccharide Intake","Being overweight has been identified as the main risk factor for the development of metabolic disorders in adults and children. However, recent studies suggest that normal weight individuals are also frequently affected by metabolic abnormalities with underlying mechanisms not yet fully understood. The aim of the present study was to determine if dietary pattern and markers of intestinal permeability, as well as inflammation, differ between normal weight healthy children and normal weight children suffering from metabolic abnormalities. In total, 45 normal weight children aged 5â? years were included in the study, of whom nine suffered from metabolic abnormalities. Anthropometric data, dietary intake and markers of inflammation, as well as intestinal permeability, were assessed in fasting blood samples. Neither BMI nor BMI-SDS differed between groups; however, children with metabolic abnormalities had a significantly larger waist circumference (+~5 cm) and a higher leptin to adiponectin ratio. While plasma leptin levels are significantly higher in normal weight children with metabolic abnormalities, neither TNF Î± nor sCD14, adiponectin, PAI-1 or IL-6 plasma levels differed between groups. Despite similar total calorie and macronutrient intake between groups, mean total fructose and total glucose intake (resulting mainly from sugar sweetened beverages, fruits and sweets) were higher in children with metabolic abnormalities than in healthy children. Time spent physically active was significantly higher in healthy normal weight children whereas time spent physically inactive was similar between groups. Furthermore, bacterial endotoxin levels were significantly higher in the peripheral plasma of normal weight children with metabolic abnormalities than in healthy normal weight children. Our results suggest that metabolic disorders in normal weight children are associated with a high monosaccharide intake and elevated bacterial endotoxin as well as leptin plasma levels, the latter also discussed as being indicative of visceral adiposity.",-1
Caring for gender diverse children and adolescents in Italy: A mixed-method investigation of clinicians' knowledge and approach to clinical practice,"Introduction:                    In today's Italy, gender diversity has assumed a remarkable resonance and visibility in both scientific and popular literature, which has facilitated the development of studies regarding treatments and support for children and adolescents with gender-related issues.              Aim:                    the aim of this study was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of how Italian clinicians (psychologists and pediatricians) perceive gender variant children and adolescents, evaluating their approach to clinical practice.              Methods:                    An online questionnaire directed to clinicians regarding their experience with, and perceptions of, gender variant children and adolescents was used for the first part of the research. In the second part of this study, Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) methodology was applied to semi-structured interviews aimed at investigating clinicians' approach to clinical practice.              Results:                    Professionals reported 374 cases, including 200 children (aged 2-11 years) and 174 adolescents (aged 12-19 years); a total of 10 interviews were conducted with professionals.              Conclusion:                    This study highlights the increase of gender variant children and adolescents seen by professionals, but also the poor awareness of Italian professionals about gender diversity and their care, as well as an absence of a network model of intervention.",-1
Assessing Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping as a participatory and interdisciplinary approach to explore marine microfiber pollution,"Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) is a participatory modelling tool used to explore complex systems by facilitating interdisciplinary cooperation and integrating a variety of knowledge systems. Here FCM was used to explore marine microfiber pollution. Through individual interviews with representatives from the research, industry, water and environmental sectors, five stakeholder FCMs were developed and used to produce an aggregated community FCM in a stakeholder workshop. Stakeholder FCMs and the revised community FCM were used to compute how the modelled system reacted to changes under two scenarios developed during the stakeholder workshop; (i) Green Shift and (ii) increased textile consumption and production. Significant differences were observed in scenario results from the stakeholder-based models and the community-based model. For societal challenges characterized by unknowns around the problem and potential solutions, inclusion of a variety of knowledge systems through FCM and deliberation processes contribute to a more holistic picture of the system and its uncertainties.",-1
IFI16 induces inflammation in hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis by regulating the Caspase-1/ IL-1 Ã pathway,"Aims and background:                    IFI16 plays an important role in innate immunity against invasive microbial infection by sensing double-stranded DNA viruses due to caspase-1-dependent inflammasome activation and subsequent maturation and secretion of IL-1Î². However, the role of IFI16 in regulating the immune response to viruses in Hepatitis B Virus-Associated Glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN), especially in sensing hepatitis B virus (HBV), has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the inflammatory role of IFI16 in HBV-GN.              Methods:                    A total 75 kidney tissue including 50 HBV-GN and 25 chronic glomerulonephritis (CCN) were collected to determine the expression of IFI16, Caspase-1 and IL-1Î² using immunohistochemistry (IHC), then the correlation between them was analyzed. In vitro, the primary human glomerular mesangial (HGM) cells and HEK-293 T cell lines were used in this study. The cell lines were both co-transfected with HBVDNA and overexpression or silencing IFI16. Quantitative Real-time PCR and western blotting were used to determine the expression of IFI16, Caspase-1 and IL-1Î².              Results:                    IFI16 expression in HBV-GN biopsies (80.0%) was significantly higher than in CGN (24.0%) and positively correlated with HBVDNA,caspase-1 and IL-1Î² expression in HBV-GN. Meanwhile, over expression of IFI16 increased caspase-1 and IL-1Î² expression in HBV-infected HGM and HEK-293 T cell lines, knockdown of IFI16 mRNA by siRNA resulted in downregulation of the caspase-1 and IL-1Î² expression in both cell lines.              Conclusions:                    The elevation of IFI16 during HBV infection or replication may contribute to renal damage due to inflammation, thus providing a putative therapeutic target and a new avenue for researching the pathogenesis of HBV-GN.",-1
[Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease],"With emerging more effective drugs, the therapeutic goal of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has progressed from clinical remission to mucosal healing. Although the inflammation could be controlled more effectively than before, symptoms such as abdominal pain and bowel habit change is still bothersome to some IBD patients. Recently, these ""refractory functional gastrointestinal symptoms"" in quiescent IBD patients has been paid more attention. The pathophysiology could be multifactorial with genetics, change in gut motility associated with post inflammatory condition, increased permeability, impaired colorectal function, visceral hypersensitivity and gut microbiota. Because both IBD and functional gastrointestinal disease (FGID) could share similar symptoms and some pathophysiology, it is sometimes challenging to distinguish them exactly. However, to reduce the risk of overtreatment or insufficient control of inflammation, exact diagnosis of functional disease or symptoms in quiescent IBD patients is important. Because there is limited randomized controlled trials or prospective study currently, most of the therapeutic approach in IBD patients are empirical or referred to those of functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, approaches based on pathophysiological mechanisms could give appropriate therapies for both IBD and FGIDs.",-1
"Dysregulation of miR-411 in cancer: Causative factor for pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis","MiRNA accounts for 1-3% of genes but regulates more than 30% of gene expression in humans. This article analyzes the current deficiencies and challenges of miR-411 research and looks forward to the prospects of miR-411 in cancer. MiR-411 is a non-coding RNA located on chromosome 14. MiR-411 is abnormally expressed in a variety of cancers. The dysregulation of miR-411 can affect cancer cell proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, colony formation, etc. miR-411 can be regulated by different lncRNAs and circRNAs. By targeting multiple genes, miR-411 participates in the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. The expression of miR-411 is related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and sensitivity of drugs in cancer patients. In conclusion, this work outlines the molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of aberrant expression of miR-411 and its target genes in cancer to reveal its potential value in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug sensitivity.",-1
Digestion of Plant Dietary miRNAs Starts in the Mouth under the Protection of Coingested Food Components and Plant-Derived Exosome-like Nanoparticles,"The regulatory functions of plant miRNAs on mammalian bodies are controversial, mainly because stability of the miRNAs in the digestive tract, as the prerequisite for their cross-kingdom effects, has somehow been overlooked. Hence, as the first stage of food ingestion, stability of plant miRNAs in human saliva has been investigated. The results show that plant miRNAs are of considerable resistance against salivary digestion, as surviving miRNAs more than 20 fM are detected. The stability varies dramatically, which can be explained by the difference in tertiary structure, governing their affinities to RNase. Surprisingly, miRNAs of low initial concentrations can end up with high survival rates after digestion. Plant miRNAs can be loaded into exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) and microcapsules formed by food components, both of which protect the miRNAs from being degraded in human saliva. Overall, plant miRNAs can apply certain strategies to maintain constant concentrations, paving the way for their potential cross-kingdom effects.",-1
"Health literacy, mental disorders and fear of progression and their association with a need for psycho-oncological care over the course of a breast cancer treatment","This studyinvestigates the need for psycho-oncological care over the course of a breast cancer treatment and possible associated factors to develop such a need. The PIAT-Study was a longitudinal postal survey study conducted in Germany (2013 to 2014) with breast cancer patients (BCPs). Patients received a questionnaire at three-time points (T1: few days after surgery, T2: after 10 weeks; T3: after 40 weeks). This study considers information about patients' needs for psycho-oncological care, their breast cancer disease, social support, anxiety, health literacy (HL) and sociodemographic information. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and logistic regression modelling to estimate the association between a need for psycho-oncological treatment and patient characteristics. N = 927 breast cancer patients reported their psycho-oncological need. 35.2% of patients report at least at one measuring point to be in need for psycho-oncological care. In a multiple logistic regression, noticeable determinants for developing such a need are an inadequateHL(OR = 1.97), fear of progression (FoP) (OR = 2.08) and psychological comorbidities (OR = 8.15) as well as certain age groups. BCPs with a low HL, suffering from a dysfunctional level of FoP or mental disorders are more likely to develop a need for psycho-oncological care.",-1
Big Data Fusion Method Based on Internet of Things Collection,"With the development of information collection technology, the data that people need to deal with are also increasing, which brings problems such as isomerization of data types, poor data quality, and fast data generation speed. At present, as an important method of data fusion technology, data fusion method based on deep learning has become an effective way of data fusion under the background of big data, which has important research significance. There is a problem with heterogeneous data types between time series data and text data, and it is difficult to fuse them effectively by traditional data fusion methods. In order to make full use of the information contained in text data and improve the accuracy of time series prediction, this paper proposes a data fusion model based on FC-SAE. In this model, GloVe and CNN are used to extract the features of text data, FC neural network is used to extract the potential features of time series data, and then, the SEA model is used to fuse the data, which fully discovers the relationship between data and greatly improves the prediction accuracy.",-1
"Preserved postprandial suppression of bone turnover markers, despite increased fasting levels, in postmenopausal women","Context:                    Menopause leads to an increased bone turnover associated with a high risk of fractures. Bone turnover is inhibited by meal intake, to some extent mediated by gut hormones, and interventions based on these endocrine changes may have potential in future prevention of osteoporosis.              Objective:                    To investigate whether postmenopausal women exhibit postprandial suppression of bone turnover markers to the same extent as premenopausal women, despite higher fasting levels. Furthermore, to assess whether menopausal differences in bone turnover markers are related to postmenopausal changes in plasma gut hormone levels.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional study of 21 premenopausal, 9 perimenopausal, and 24 postmenopausal women between 45 and 60 years of age. Serum/plasma levels of bone turnover markers and gut hormones were investigated during a 120 min oral glucose tolerance test. Bone turnover markers included N-terminal propeptide of type-I procollagen (PINP, bone formation marker) and carboxyterminal collagen I crosslinks (CTX-I, bone resorption marker). Gut hormone secretion was evaluated from responses of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).              Results:                    Fasting levels of s-CTX-I were increased in peri- and postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women (p = 0.001). Despite higher fasting levels, the relative postprandial s-CTX-I suppression was comparable across menopausal status (p = 0.14). Fasting levels of s-PINP were also increased in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women (p < 0.001) with comparable and modest s-PINP suppression over menopause (p = 0.13). Postprandial plasma GLP-1 (p = 0.006) and GLP-2 (p = 0.01) were significantly increased in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women while GIP responses were slightly increased in the perimenopausal group (p = 0.02) but comparable between pre- and postmenopausal women. None of the postprandial gut hormone increases predicted postprandial bone turnover suppression in these women.              Conclusions:                    Glucose-induced suppression of bone turnover markers is preserved in postmenopausal women, despite significantly higher fasting values, indicating that CTX-I lowering treatments based on these postprandial mechanisms might be a feasible strategy to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis.",-1
Engineered Nucleotide Chemicapacitive Microsensor Array Augmented with Physics-Guided Machine Learning for High-Throughput Screening of Cannabidiol,"The recent legalization of cannabidiol (CBD) to treat neurological conditions such as epilepsy has sparked rising interest across global pharmaceuticals and synthetic biology industries to engineer microbes for sustainable synthetic production of medicinal CBD. Since the process involves screening large amounts of samples, the main challenge is often associated with the conventional screening platform that is time consuming, and laborious with high operating costs. Here, a portable, high-throughput Aptamer-based BioSenSing System (ABS3 ) is introduced for label-free, low-cost, fully automated, and highly accurate CBD concentrations' classification in a complex biological environment. The ABS3 comprises an array of interdigitated microelectrode sensors, each functionalized with different engineered aptamers. To further empower the functionality of the ABS3 , unique electrochemical features from each sensor are synergized using physics-guided multidimensional analysis. The capabilities of this ABS3 are demonstrated by achieving excellent CBD concentrations' classification with a high prediction accuracy of 99.98% and a fast testing time of 22 Âµs per testing sample using the optimized random forest (RF) model. It is foreseen that this approach will be the key to the realistic transformation from fundamental research to system miniaturization for diagnostics of disease biomarkers and drug development in the field of chemical/bioanalytics.",-1
Visit-to-visit fasting plasma glucose variability is associated with left ventricular adverse remodeling in diabetic patients with STEMI,"Background:                    Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are predisposed to poor cardiovascular outcomes after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Left ventricular adverse remodeling (LVAR) triggered upon myocardial infarction is recognized as the predominant pathological process in the development of heart failure. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether visit-to-visit fasting plasma glucose (FPG) variability is a potential predictor of LVAR in T2DM patients after STEMI.              Methods:                    From January 2014 to December 2018 in Ruijin Hospital, T2DM patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention were consecutively enrolled and followed up for ~ 12 months. The changes in left ventricular geometric and functional parameters between baseline and 12-month follow-up were assessed by echocardiography. The incidence of LVAR, defined as 20% increase in indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and its relationship with visit-to-visit FPG variability were analyzed. Multivariate regression models were constructed to test the predictive value of FPG variability for post-infarction LVAR.              Results:                    A total of 437 patients with type 2 diabetes and STEMI were included in the final analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.4 Â± 1.1 months, the incidence of LVAR was 20.6% and mean enlargement of indexed LVEDV was 3.31 Â± 14.4 mL/m2, which was significantly increased in patients with higher coefficient variance (CV) of FPG (P = 0.002) irrespective of baseline glycemic levels. In multivariate analysis, FPG variability was independently associated with incidence of post-infarction LVAR after adjustment for traditional risk factors, baseline HbA1c as well as mean FPG during follow-up (OR: 3.021 [95% CI 1.081-8.764] for highest vs. lowest tertile of CV of FPG). Assessing FPG variability by other two measures, including standard deviation (SD) and variability independent of the mean (VIM), yielded similar findings.              Conclusions:                    This study suggests that visit-to-visit FPG variability is an independent predictor of incidence of LVAR in T2DM patients with STEMI.

Dual-modal nanoplatform integrated with smartphone for hierarchical diabetic detection,"On-site screening of diabetes and precise diagnosis of diabetic complications may provide a conduit for early intervention and disease burden reduction. However, stratified metabolic analysis needs designed materials for colorimetric detection of targeted biomarkers and direct metabolic fingerprinting of the native blood. Here, an advanced dual-modal nanoplatform is constructed based on PdPtAu alloys, which serve both as the nanoenzymes in colorimetric sensing for targeted metabolite quantitation and as matrix in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for untargeted metabolic fingerprinting. The platform achieved rapid glucose quantitation toward point-of-care testing of 27 participants and identified diabetic retinopathy from diabetic population with a sensitivity and specificity of 84.6%. We further assessed the generalizability of the nanoplatform for real-case applications, through the captured digital images and computing resources equipped in smartphones. The results advance the design of material-based platforms for stratified metabolic analysis and display promise to fit in the current hierarchical medical system in practice.",-1
"Interactions between miRNAs and Double-Strand Breaks DNA Repair Genes, Pursuing a Fine-Tuning of Repair","The repair of DNA damage is a crucial process for the correct maintenance of genetic information, thus, allowing the proper functioning of cells. Among the different types of lesions occurring in DNA, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered the most harmful type of lesion, which can result in significant loss of genetic information, leading to diseases, such as cancer. DSB repair occurs through two main mechanisms, called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR). There is evidence showing that miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of genes acting in NHEJ and HRR mechanisms, either through direct complementary binding to mRNA targets, thus, repressing translation, or by targeting other genes involved in the transcription and activity of DSB repair genes. Therefore, alteration of miRNA expression has an impact on the ability of cells to repair DSBs, which, in turn, affects cancer therapy sensitivity. This latter gives account of the importance of miRNAs as regulators of NHEJ and HRR and places them as a promising target to improve cancer therapy. Here, we review recent reports demonstrating an association between miRNAs and genes involved in NHEJ and HRR. We employed the Web of Science search query TS (""gene official symbol/gene aliases*"" AND ""miRNA/microRNA/miR-"") and focused on articles published in the last decade, between 2010 and 2021. We also performed a data analysis to represent miRNA-mRNA validated interactions from TarBase v.8, in order to offer an updated overview about the role of miRNAs as regulators of DSB repair.",-1
Identification and Validation of miR-222-3p and miR-409-3p as Plasma Biomarkers in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Sharing Validated Target Genes Involved in Metabolic Homeostasis,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) causes both maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. The deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in GDM suggests their involvement in GDM pathogenesis and complications. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of endosomal origin, released via exocytosis into the extracellular compartment. Through EVs, miRNAs are delivered in distant target cells and are able to affect gene expression. In this study, miRNA expression was analyzed to find new miRNAs that could improve GDM classification and molecular characterization. MiRNA were profiled in total plasma and EVs in GDM patients and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) women. Samples were collected at third trimester of gestation from two diabetes centers. MiRNA expression was profiled in a discovery cohort using the multiplexed NanoString nCounter Human v3 miRNA. Validation analysis was performed in a second independent cohort using RT-qPCR. A set of miRNAs resulted to be differentially expressed (DE) in total plasma and EVs in GDM. Among them, total plasma miR-222-3p and miR-409-3p were validated in the independent cohort. MiR-222-3p levels correlated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (p &lt; 0.001) and birth weight (p = 0.012), whereas miR-409-3p expression correlated with FPG (p &lt; 0.001) and inversely with gestational age (p = 0.001). The major validated target genes of the deregulated miRNAs were consistently linked to type 2 diabetes and GDM pathophysiology. MiR-222-3p and miR-409-3p are two circulating biomarkers that could improve GDM classification power and act in the context of the molecular events leading to the metabolic alterations observed in GDM.",-1
Metachronous metastasis to contralateral retroperitoneal adipose tissue after radical nephrectomy: a case report and review of the literature,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis to the adrenal gland, perirenal adipose tissue, and ureter on the contralateral side is rare. We report a case of solitary metachronous clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) metastasis to the contralateral retroperitoneal adipose tissue, which was identified after radical nephrectomy. A patient had undergone retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy for RCC in the right kidney in December 2012. Postoperative pathological analysis showed Fuhrman grade I ccRCC, T1bN0M0. Three years after surgery, a solitary tumor of 1.0 Ã 1.0 cm was identified by an abdominal computed tomographic scan inside the retroperitoneal fat pad in front of the left posterior abdominal wall, without adhesion to the abdominal wall. The tumor was then completely resected by retroperitoneal laparoscopic resection. Pathological analysis showed that it was a metastasized lesion from a previous tumor. Nine months after surgery, there was no sign of recurrence confirmed by radiographic follow-up. Findings from this case indicate the unpredictability of dissemination of RCC. Our findings support a follow-up regimen that includes regular postoperative computed tomographic scans to identify early metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of contralateral retroperitoneal adipose metastasis after laparoscopic tumorectomy.",-1
Associations of neurotransmitters and the gut microbiome with emotional distress in mixed type of irritable bowel syndrome,"Evidence highlights the comorbidity between emotional distress and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) through the gut-brain axis. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the associations among neurotransmitter levels and the gut microbiome profiles in persons with IBS and emotional distress. In this nested case-controlled study, emotional symptoms, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, were evaluated in 40 persons with IBS and 20 healthy controls (HC). Plasma neurotransmitters levels (serotonin and norepinephrine) and the gut microbiome profile of the collected fecal samples were examined. Emotional distress and microbiome profile were significantly different between IBS and HC groups. Lower but not significant neurotransmitters' levels (serotonin and norepinephrine) were observed in the IBS group compared to the HC. A negative correlation was found between norepinephrine levels and alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices) in the IBS group. Moreover, serotonin levels were positively associated with the abundance of Proteobacteria, and norepinephrine were positively correlated with Bacteroidetes, but negatively associated with Firmicutes phylum. The present study demonstrated alteration in the gut microbiome between persons with IBS and emotional distress compared to HC. The correlations between plasma neurotransmitters and the gut microbiome suggest that the gut microbiome may impact the regulation of neurotransmitters.",-1
Adolescent executive cognitive functioning and trait impulsivity as predictors of young-adult risky drinking and alcohol-related problems,"Executive cognitive functioning (ECF) and trait impulsivity have long been implicated in risky drinking and alcohol-related problems. However, research on these constructs has developed independently. The present study tested whether two subdomains of adolescent ECF (updating and response inhibition) and adolescent trait impulsivity, considered separately and together, predicted young-adult risky drinking and alcohol-related problems. Data came from the Adolescent/Adult Family Development Project-a longitudinal study of the intergenerational transmission of alcohol use. Alcohol-naÃ¯ve youth ages 11-17 (N = 249) completed three tasks tapping ECF subdomains of updating (letter-number sequencing, matrix span task) and inhibition (immediate memory task) and a self-reported measure of trait impulsivity (UPPS-P). Approximately 7 years later (ages 18-25), participants reported on their drinking behavior (maximum drinks in a day, heavy episodic drinking, alcohol-related problems). We tested whether adolescent ECF and trait impulsivity predicted young-adult drinking outcomes, separately and together. Results showed that poorer adolescent ECF (a latent factor) predicted more maximum drinks in a day (Incidence Rate Ratios [IRR] = 1.27, p = .001) but not young-adult heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related problems. In contrast, adolescent trait impulsivity predicted all three outcomes: maximum drinks in a day (IRR = 1.34, p < .001), heavy episodic drinking (Î² = 0.27, p < .001), and alcohol-related problems in young adulthood (IRR = 1.60, p = .001). Results were similar when adolescent ECF and trait impulsivity were considered together in the same model. Findings suggest that adolescent trait impulsivity is a robust predictor of young-adult risky drinking and alcohol-related problems. Adolescent ECF, and specifically response inhibition, may add predictive value over and above trait impulsivity for some alcohol outcomes.

"Ameliorative Effect of Oxytocin on FBN1 and PEPCK Gene Expression, and Behavioral Patterns in Rats' Obesity-Induced Diabetes","Amelioration of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance associated with obesity is a cardinal target for therapeutics. Therefore, we investigated the relation of Fibrilln-1 (FBN1) mRNA expression and hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate caboxykinase (PEPCK) enzyme to the ameliorative impact of oxytocin on obesity-induced diabetes, suggesting glycogenolysis markers in diabetic models. Four groups of forty male Wistar rats were formed (n = 10): a control group fed basal diet and intraperitoneal injections of saline; an oxytocin-injected group; a diet-induced obese group fed a high-fat/high-sugar diet and injected with saline; a diet-induced obese group injected with oxytocin. Depending on blood glucose levels, obese groups were further sub-grouped into prediabetic, and diabetic rats, with 5 rats each, at the ninth and the 16th week of the feeding period, respectively. FBN1 expression and PEPCK activity were determined using the qPCR technique and some biochemical parameters (glycemic, lipid profile, kidney, and liver functions) were determined using kits. Obese groups showed an elevation of brain FBN1 expression, high serum lipid profile, high glucose level, and a deleterious impact on liver and kidney functions. Obese groups showed the stimulator effect of the PEPCK enzyme and time-dependent pathological changes in renal and hepatic tissues. The motor activities were negatively correlated with FBN1 gene expression in prediabetic and diabetic rats. In addition to our previous review of the crucial role of asprosin, here we showed that oxytocin could ameliorate obesity-induced diabetes and decrease FBN1 gene expression centrally to block appetite. Oxytocin caused decreases in PEPCK enzyme activity as well as glycogenolysis in the liver. Therefore, oxytocin has a potential effect on FBN1 expression and PEPCK enzyme activity in the obesity-induced diabetic-rat model.",-1
Falling down the digital divide: A cautionary tale,"The disruptions of the coronavirus pandemic have enabled new opportunities for telehealth expansion within movement disorders. However, inadequate internet infrastructure has, unfortunately, led to fragmented implementation and may worsen disparities in some areas. In this Correspondence, we report on geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in access to our center's comprehensive care clinic for people with Parkinson's disease. While both in-person and virtual versions of the clinic enjoyed high patient satisfaction, we discovered that participation by Black/African-American individuals was cut in half when we shifted to a virtual delivery format in April 2020. We outline potential barriers in access using a socio-ecological model.",-1
Long COVID-19 in Children: From the Pathogenesis to the Biologically Plausible Roots of the Syndrome,"Long Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) refers to the persistence of symptoms related to the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This condition is described as persistent and can manifest in various combinations of signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, dyspnea, depression, cognitive impairment, and altered perception of smells and tastes. Long COVID-19 may be due to long-term damage to different organs-such as lung, brain, kidney, and heart-caused by persisting viral-induced inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, diffuse endothelial damage, and micro thrombosis. In this review, we discuss the potential and biologically plausible role of some vitamins, essential elements, and functional foods based on the hypothesis that an individual's dietary status may play an important adjunctive role in protective immunity against COVID-19 and possibly against its long-term consequences.",-1
[Impacts of glycemic variability on the relationship between time in range and estimated glycated hemoglobin in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus],"Objective: This study is to investigate the relationship between time in range (TIR) and glucose management indicator (GMI), and the impact of glycemic variability (GV) on their relationship in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Methods: The CGM data were collected from a multicenter randomized clinical trial of adults (â?8 years old) with T1DM, including 83 T1DM patients, respectively from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (72 cases), Drum Tower Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University School of Medicine (2 cases), and the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (9 cases). All subjects wore the iProTM2 system for 14 days at baseline (0-2 weeks), 3 months (12-14 weeks), and 6 months (24-26 weeks). Data derived from iProTM2 sensor was used to calculate CGM parameters. Correlation between TIR and GMI was explored according to different stratification of glycemic variability assessed by glucose coefficient of variation (CV). Predicted TIR in the fixed GMI value was calculated via the linear regression equations performed in the respective interquartile group of CV. Results: From November 2017 to June 2021, a total of 233 CGM data were collected with 83 collected from baseline, 80 from the 3-month follow-up, 70 from the 6-month follow-up. Patients including 27 males had a median (Q1, Q3) age of 30.69 (25.22, 38.43) years, with a diabetes duration of 10.05(4.46, 13.92) years. The median (Q1, Q3) and effective wearing time of available CGM data was 13.92 (13.02, 14.00) days and 91.61% (84.96%, 95.94%), and the value of TIR, GMI and CV was 60.34%Â±13.03%, 7.14%Â±0.61% and 41.01%Â±7.64%, respectively. There was a strong negative correlation between TIR and GMI (r=-0.822, P<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the predictive value of TIR calculated from a given GMI was 8.352% higher when CV was up to standard (36%) than that when CV was down to standard. Based on the multiple linear regression equations generated from quartiles of CV, the predicted TIR value was decreased across the ascending quartiles with 69.98 % in the lowest quartile of CV (â?5.91%), 64.57 % in 25th-50th quartile of CV (35.91%<CVâ?0.08%), 60.96% in 50th-75th quartile of CV (40.08%<CVâ?5.86%) and 56.44% in the highest quartile of CV (>75th quartile, CV>45.86%) when GMI was set as 7%. Conclusions: There is a strong correlation between TIR and GMI in adult patients with T1DM in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. CV influenced the relationship between TIR and GMI.",-1
The Complexity of Sesquiterpene Chemistry Dictates Its Pleiotropic Biologic Effects on Inflammation,"Sesquiterpenes (SQs) are volatile compounds made by plants, insects, and marine organisms. SQ have a large range of biological properties and are potent inhibitors and modulators of inflammation, targeting specific components of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway and nitric oxide (NO) generation. Because SQs can be isolated from over 1600 genera and 2500 species grown worldwide, they are an attractive source of phytochemical therapeutics. The chemical structure and biosynthesis of SQs is complex, and the SQ scaffold represents extraordinary structural variety consisting of both acyclic and cyclic (mono, bi, tri, and tetracyclic) compounds. These structures can be decorated with a diverse range of functional groups and substituents, generating many stereospecific configurations. In this review, the effect of SQs on inflammation will be discussed in the context of their complex chemistry. Because inflammation is a multifactorial process, we focus on specific aspects of inflammation: the inhibition of NF-kB signaling, disruption of NO production and modulation of dendritic cells, mast cells, and monocytes.

"Long non-coding RNA long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1232 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in bladder cancer via modulating miR-370-5p/PIM3 axis","Increasing evidences have suggested that long non-coding RNAs are critical regulators in the progression of tumor growth. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1232 (LINC01232) was verified as an oncogene in multiple cancers. Nevertheless, its function in bladder cancer (BC) remains to be uncovered. In the current study, we detected LINC01232 expression utilizing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and discovered that LINC01232 was overexpressed in BC cell lines versus normal cell line. Besides, the effect of LINC01232 on BC cell behaviors was measured by colony formation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling and caspase-3/8 activity assays. Functionally, LINC01232 deficiency suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Next, miR-370-5p was proved to bind with LINC01232 by RNA pull down, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, PIM3 expression was negatively modulated by miR-370-5p and markedly increased in BC cell lines. Moreover, PIM3 silence repressed proliferation, migration and invasion but triggered apoptosis of BC cells. The rescue assays validated that upregulation of PIM3 recovered the effects of LINC01232 silence on the growth of BC cells. To summarize, our study manifested that LINC01232 accelerates BC progression by targeting miR-370-5p/PIM3 axis. Targeting LINC01232 might offer novel insight into BC treatment.",-1
COVID-19 and the paediatric acute abdomen-the emerging dilemma of PIMS-TS,"PIMS-TS is a newly emerging complication of COVID-19 infection in paediatric patients. A common presenting complaint is that of the 'acute abdomen', however only a small proportion of patients are eventually diagnosed with a GI pathology requiring surgical intervention. A high level of suspicion and close working with the MDT is therefore required by surgical teams involved in the care of these patients.",-1
The effect of resource limitation on the temperature dependence of mosquito population fitness,"Laboratory-derived temperature dependencies of life-history traits are increasingly being used to make mechanistic predictions for how climatic warming will affect vector-borne disease dynamics, partially by affecting abundance dynamics of the vector population. These temperature-trait relationships are typically estimated from juvenile populations reared on optimal resource supply, even though natural populations of vectors are expected to experience variation in resource supply, including intermittent resource limitation. Using laboratory experiments on the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a principal arbovirus vector, combined with stage-structured population modelling, we show that low-resource supply in the juvenile life stages significantly depresses the vector's maximal population growth rate across the entire temperature range (22-32Â°C) and causes it to peak at a lower temperature than at high-resource supply. This effect is primarily driven by an increase in juvenile mortality and development time, combined with a decrease in adult size with temperature at low-resource supply. Our study suggests that most projections of temperature-dependent vector abundance and disease transmission are likely to be biased because they are based on traits measured under optimal resource supply. Our results provide compelling evidence for future studies to consider resource supply when predicting the effects of climate and habitat change on vector-borne disease transmission, disease vectors and other arthropods.",-1
Aortic root reinforcement in aortic valve endocarditis with annular abscess: The Calamari procedure,"Treatment of infective endocarditis can often prove challenging due to its wide range of anatomical presentations. When complicated by an aortic root abscess, patients may require extensive root surgery, which on its own leads to a worse outcome. We present our experience with a surgical technique for reinforcing the aortic annulus with a ring from a Dacron aortic prosthesis placed in the left ventricular outflow tract to avoid the need for root replacement procedures or patch closures of the defect. The technique described in this paper provides a viable alternative to the standard techniques used for the treatment of annular abscesses in aortic valve endocarditis. Due to the relative simplicity and ease of use, this approach may present a means of reducing operation time and possibly postoperative complications of this severe condition.",-1
Antifungal and Larvicidal Activities of Phlorotannins from Brown Seaweeds,"Phlorotannins are secondary metabolites produced by brown seaweeds with antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and larvicidal activities. Phlorotannins' structures are formed by dibenzodioxin, ether and phenyl, ether, or phenyl linkages. The polymerization of phlorotannins is used to classify and characterize. The structural diversity of phlorotannins grows as polymerization increases. They have been characterized extensively with respect to chemical properties and functionality. However, review papers of the biological activities of phlorotannins have focused on their antibacterial and antiviral effects, and reviews of their broad antifungal and larvicidal effects are lacking. Accordingly, evidence for the effectiveness of phlorotannins as antifungal and larvicidal agents is discussed in this review. Online databases (ScienceDirect, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) were used to identify relevant articles. In total, 11 articles were retrieved after duplicates were removed and exclusion criteria were applied. Phlorotannins from brown seaweeds show antifungal activity against dermal and plant fungi, and larvicidal activity against mosquitos and marine invertebrate larvae. However, further studies of the biological activity of phlorotannins against fungal and parasitic infections in aquaculture fish, livestock, and companion animals are needed for systematic analyses of their effectiveness. The research described in this review emphasizes the potential applications of phlorotannins as pharmaceutical, functional food, pesticide, and antifouling agents.",-1
Research on SVR Water Quality Prediction Model Based on Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm,"Multiparameter water quality trend prediction technique is one of the important tools for water environment management and regulation. This study proposes a new water quality prediction model with better prediction performance, which is combined with improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) and support vector regression (SVR) machine. For the problems of low population diversity and easily falling into local optimum of sparrow search algorithm (SSA), ISSA is proposed to increase the initial population diversity by introducing Skew-Tent mapping and to help the algorithm jump out of local optimum by using the adaptive elimination mechanism. The optimal values of the penalty factor C and kernel function parameter g of the SVR model are selected using ISSA to make the model have better prediction accuracy and generalization performance. The performance of the ISSA-SVR water quality prediction model is compared with BP neural network, SVR model, and other hybrid models by conducting water quality prediction experiments with actual breeding-water quality data. The experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy of the ISSA-SVR model was significantly higher than that of other models, reaching 99.2%; the mean square deviation (MSE) was 0.013, which was 79.37% lower than that of the SVR model and 75% lower than that of SSA-SVR model, and the coefficient of determination (R 2) was 0.98, which was 5.38% higher than that of the SVR model and 7.57% higher than that of the SSA-SVR model, indicating that the ISSA-SVR water quality prediction model has some engineering application value in the field of water body management.",-1
Immuno-Imaging (PET/SPECT)-Quo Vadis?,"The use of immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment regimen of certain cancer types, but response assessment has become a difficult task with conventional methods such as CT/MRT or FDG PET-CT and the classical response criteria such as RECIST or PERCIST which have been developed for chemotherapeutic treatment. Plenty of new tracers have been published to improve the assessment of treatment response and to stratify the patient population. We gathered the information on published tracers (in total, 106 individual SPECT/PET tracers were identified) and performed a descriptor-based analysis; in this way, we classify the tracers with regard to target choice, developability (probability to progress from preclinical stage into the clinic), translatability (probability to be widely applied in the 'real world'), and (assumed) diagnostic quality. In our analysis, we show that most tracers are targeting PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, and CD8 receptors by using antibodies or their fragments. Another finding is that plenty of tracers possess only minor iterations regarding chelators and nuclides instead of approaching the problem in a new innovative way. Based on the data, we suggest an orthogonal approach by targeting intracellular targets with PET-activatable small molecules that are currently underrepresented.",-1
Cockroaches adjust body and appendages to traverse cluttered large obstacles,"To traverse complex terrain, animals often transition between locomotor modes. It is well known that locomotor transitions can be induced by switching in neural control circuits or driven by a need to minimize metabolic energetic cost. Recent work revealed that locomotor transitions in complex 3D terrain cluttered with large obstacles can emerge from physical interaction with the environment controlled by the nervous system. For example, to traverse cluttered, stiff grass-like beams, the discoid cockroach often transitions from using a strenuous pitch mode pushing across the beams to using a less strenuous roll mode rolling into and through the gaps. This transition can save mechanical energetic cost substantially (â?00-101 mJ) but requires overcoming a potential energy barrier (â?0-3-10-2 mJ). Previous robotic physical modeling demonstrated that kinetic energy fluctuation of body oscillation from self-propulsion can help overcome the barrier and facilitate this transition. However, the animal was observed to transition even when the barrier still exceeded kinetic energy fluctuation. Here, we further studied whether and how the cockroach makes active adjustments to facilitate this transition to traverse cluttered beams. The animal repeatedly flexed its head and abdomen, reduced hindleg sprawl, and depressed one hindleg and elevated the other during the pitch-to-roll transition, adjustments which were absent when running on a flat ground. Using a refined potential energy landscape with additional degrees of freedom to model these adjustments, we found that head flexion did not substantially reduce the transition barrier (by â?0-3 mJ), whereas leg sprawl reduction did so dramatically (by â?0-2 mJ). We speculate that head flexion is for sensing the terrain to guide the transition via sensory feedback control.",-1
Association of fatty pancreas with pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function,"Aim:                    The purpose of this study was to clarify whether fatty pancreas might lead to impaired pancreatic endocrine or exocrine function.              Material and methods:                    The study involved 109 participants who had undergone the glucagon stimulation test and N-benzoyl-L-tyros-p-amino benzoic acid (BT-PABA) test to assess pancreatic function as well as unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT). Pancreatic endocrine impairment was defined as ÎC peptide immunoreactivity less than 2 [mmol/L] in the glucagon stimulation test, and pancreatic exocrine impairment was defined as a urinary PABA excretion rate less than 70% on the BT-PABA test. We defined as the mean CT value of pancreas / CT value of spleen (P/S ratio) as a marker to assess fatty pancreas. We analyzed the association between fatty pancreas and pancreatic impairment using the logistic regression model. The odds ratio (OR) is shown per 0.1 unit.              Results:                    Pancreatic endocrine function was impaired in 33.0% of the participants, and 56.9% of those were regarded as having pancreatic exocrine impairment. The P/S ratio was significantly correlated with pancreatic endocrine impairment in univariate analysis (OR = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.43-0.83, P = 0.0013) and multivariate analysis (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.22-0.61, P < .0001) for all participants. Similar significant relationships were observed in both univariate (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.49-0.99, P = 0.04) and multivariate (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.21-0.66, P = 0.0002) analyses for the participants without diabetes (n = 93). The amount of pancreatic fat was not associated with exocrine impairment in univariate analysis (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.59-1.06, P = 0.12).              Conclusion:                    Fatty pancreas was associated with pancreatic endocrine impairment but did not have a clear relationship with pancreatic exocrine impairment.",-1
An Analytical Study of Speech Pathology Detection Based on MFCC and Deep Neural Networks,"Diseases of internal organs other than the vocal folds can also affect a person's voice. As a result, voice problems are on the rise, even though they are frequently overlooked. According to a recent study, voice pathology detection systems can successfully help the assessment of voice abnormalities and enable the early diagnosis of voice pathology. For instance, in the early identification and diagnosis of voice problems, the automatic system for distinguishing healthy and diseased voices has gotten much attention. As a result, artificial intelligence-assisted voice analysis brings up new possibilities in healthcare. The work was aimed at assessing the utility of several automatic speech signal analysis methods for diagnosing voice disorders and suggesting a strategy for classifying healthy and diseased voices. The proposed framework integrates the efficacy of three voice characteristics: chroma, mel spectrogram, and mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC). We also designed a deep neural network (DNN) capable of learning from the retrieved data and producing a highly accurate voice-based disease prediction model. The study describes a series of studies using the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD) to detect abnormal voices. The model was developed and tested using the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/ pronounced in high, low, and average pitches. We also maintained the ""continuous sentence"" audio files collected from SVD to select how well the developed model generalizes to completely new data. The highest accuracy achieved was 77.49%, superior to prior attempts in the same domain. Additionally, the model attains an accuracy of 88.01% by integrating speaker gender information. The designed model trained on selected diseases can also obtain a maximum accuracy of 96.77% (cordectomy Ã healthy). As a result, the suggested framework is the best fit for the healthcare industry.",-1
Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Secretion Is Inhibited by Lysophosphatidic Acid,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). While dozens of compounds stimulate GLP-1 secretion, few inhibit. Reduced GLP-1 secretion and impaired GSIS occur in chronic inflammation. Lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are bioactive phospholipids elevated in inflammation. The aim of this study was to test whether LPA inhibits GLP-1 secretion in vitro and in vivo. GLUTag L-cells were treated with various LPA species, with or without LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonists, and media GLP-1 levels, cellular cyclic AMP and calcium ion concentrations, and DPP4 activity levels were analyzed. Mice were injected with LPA, with or without LPAR antagonists, and serum GLP-1 and DPP4 activity were measured. GLUTag GLP-1 secretion was decreased ~70-90% by various LPAs. GLUTag expression of Lpar1, 2, and 3 was orders of magnitude higher than Lpar4, 5, and 6, implicating the former group in this effect. In agreement, inhibition of GLP-1 secretion was reversed by the LPAR1/3 antagonist Ki16425, the LPAR1 antagonists AM095 and AM966, or the LPAR2 antagonist LPA2-antagonist 1. We hypothesized involvement of GÎ±i-mediated LPAR activity, and found that intracellular cyclic AMP and calcium ion concentrations were decreased by LPA, but restored by Ki16425. Mouse LPA injection caused an ~50% fall in circulating GLP-1, although only LPAR1 or LPAR1/3 antagonists, but not LPAR2 antagonism, prevented this. GLUTag L-cell and mouse serum DPP4 activity was unchanged by LPA or LPAR antagonists. LPA therefore impairs GLP-1 secretion in vitro and in vivo through GÎ±i-coupled LPAR1/3 signaling, providing a new mechanism linking inflammation with impaired GSIS.",-1
"Anti-Inflammatory and Neuroprotective Mechanisms of GTS-21, an Î±7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Agonist, in Neuroinflammation and Parkinson's Disease Mouse Models","Neuroinflammation is crucial in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, controlling neuroinflammation has been proposed as an important therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disease. In the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of GTS-21, a selective Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Î±7 nAChR) agonist, in neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse models. GTS-21 inhibited the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and primary microglia. Further research revealed that GTS-21 has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting PI3K/Akt, NF-ÎºB, and upregulating AMPK, Nrf2, CREB, and PPARÎ³ signals. The effects of GTS-21 on these pro-/anti-inflammatory signaling molecules were reversed by treatment with an Î±7 nAChR antagonist, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of GTS-21 are mediated through Î±7 nAChR activation. The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of GTS-21 were then confirmed in LPS-induced systemic inflammation and MPTP-induced PD model mice. In LPS-injected mouse brains, GTS-21 reduced microglial activation and production of proinflammatory markers. Furthermore, in the brains of MPTP-injected mice, GTS-21 restored locomotor activity and dopaminergic neuronal cell death while inhibiting microglial activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression. These findings suggest that GTS-21 has therapeutic potential in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.",-1
"Association of Pancreatic Steatosis With Chronic Pancreatitis, Obesity, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","Objective:                    The aim of this study was to determine the association of the pancreatic steatosis with obesity, chronic pancreatitis (CP), and type 2 diabetes mellitus.              Methods:                    Patients (n = 118) were retrospectively identified and categorized into no CP (n = 60), mild (n = 21), moderate (n = 27), and severe CP (n = 10) groups based on clinical history and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography using the Cambridge classification as the diagnostic standard. Visceral and subcutaneous compartments were manually segmented, and fat tissue was quantitatively measured on axial magnetic resonance imaging.              Results:                    Pancreatic fat fraction showed a direct correlation with fat within the visceral compartment (r = 0.54). Patients with CP showed higher visceral fat (P = 0.01) and pancreatic fat fraction (P < 0.001): mild, 24%; moderate, 23%; severe CP, 21%; no CP group, 15%. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus showed higher pancreatic steatosis (P = 0.03) and higher visceral (P = 0.007) and subcutaneous fat (P = 0.004). Interobserver variability of measuring fat by magnetic resonance imaging was excellent (r â?0.90-0.99).              Conclusions:                    Increased visceral adipose tissue has a moderate direct correlation with pancreatic fat fraction. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with higher pancreatic fat fraction and visceral fat. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with higher pancreatic fat fraction and visceral and subcutaneous adiposity.",-1
Two weeks of twice-daily prism adaptation treatment does not improve posture or gait in Parkinson's disease: a double-blind randomized controlled trial,"Background:                    Gait difficulties in Parkinson's disease have been related to problems shifting the center of gravity forward. We previously showed reduced forward stepping latencies for people with Parkinson's disease after one session of adaptation to upward visual shifts, which produces downward motor after-effects and potentially shifts the center of gravity forward. Here we tested if repeated prism adaptation improved gait and postural control in Parkinson's disease through a parallel, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial.              Methods:                    We recruited participants with idiopathic Parkinson's disease aged 40-85 and meeting any one of three clinical criteria: (1) Hoehn and Yahr Stage II.5-IV; (2) scoring > 0 on the gait, freezing of gait, and/or postural stability items of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; or (3) Timed Up and Go > 12 s. Sealed envelope style randomization allocated participants to two weeks of twice-daily prism adaptation or sham treatment. Participants, care givers, and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. Primary outcomes were changes in postural control measured using the Berg Balance Scale and the Limits of Stability, Sensory Organization, and Motor Control tests from the Smart EquiTest system. Secondary outcomes included other physiotherapy and questionnaire measures. Outcomes were assessed at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center immediately before and after the treatment period, with further long-term postal follow-up over 3 months. Outcomes were analyzed using analyses of variance with follow-up t tests.              Results:                    Eighteen participants were allocated to undergo prism adaptation, of which sixteen were analyzed. Thirteen participants were allocated to undergo sham treatment, and all were analyzed. The prism adaptation group showed increased forward stepping velocity on the Limits of Stability test (pre: M=2.33, SEM=0.24; post: M=2.88, SEM=0.26; t(15)=3.2, p=.005, d=.819). The sham group showed no such change (pre: M=2.13, SEM=0.22; 1d post: M=2.24, SEM=0.22; t(13)=.636, p=.537, d=.176). However, there were no group differences for any other outcome measures and no indications that prism adaptation produced functional improvements in posture, gait, or activities of daily living.              Conclusions:                    Prism adaptation does not improve gait or postural control in Parkinson's disease.              Trial registration:                    ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02380859 .

Carboxyl Ester Lipase May Not Mediate Lipotoxic Injury during Severe Acute Pancreatitis,"Acute lipolysis of visceral fat or circulating triglycerides may worsen acute pancreatitis (AP)-associated local and systemic injury. The pancreas expresses pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PNLIP), pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PNLIPRP2), and carboxyl ester lipase (CEL), which may leak into the visceral fat or systemic circulation during pancreatitis. We, thus, aimed to determine the pancreatic lipase(s) regulating lipotoxicity during AP. For this AP, associated fat necrosis was analyzed using Western blot analysis. Bile acid (using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and fatty acid (using gas chromatography) concentrations were measured in human fat necrosis. The fat necrosis milieu was simulated in vitro using glyceryl trilinoleate because linoleic acid is increased in fat necrosis. Bile acid requirements to effectively hydrolyze glyceryl trilinoleate were studied using exogenous or overexpressed lipases. The renal cell line (HEK 293) was used to study lipotoxic injury. Because dual pancreatic lipase knockouts are lethal, exocrine parotid acini lacking lipases were used to verify the results. PNLIP, PNLIPRP2, and CEL were increased in fat necrosis. Although PNLIP and PNLIPRP2 were equipotent in inducing lipolysis and lipotoxic injury, CEL required bile acid concentrations higher than in human fat necrosis. The high bile acid requirements for effective lipolysis make CEL an unlikely mediator of lipotoxic injury in AP. It remains to be explored whether PNLIP or PNLIPRP2 worsens AP severity in vivo.",-1
Hypoglycemia in cystic fibrosis during an extended oral glucose tolerance test,"Background:                    Hypoglycemia in cystic fibrosis (CF), in the absence of glucose-lowering therapies, has long been identified as an important issue in the management of CF. There is currently still no unifying hypothesis for its etiology.              Aim:                    The aims of this study were to perform a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in participants with CF and (1) document glucose, insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) release patterns within varying glucose tolerance groups during the OGTT; (2) determine the prevalence of hypoglycemic during the OGTT; and (3) define any association between hypoglycemia and patterns of insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP release.              Methods:                    Eligible participants attending an adult CF clinic completed a 3-h OGTT. Hypoglycemia on OGTT was defined as mild (glucose 3.4-3.9 mmol/L), moderate (glucose 3.1-3.3 mmol/L), and severe (glucose â?3 mmol/L). Hormones were measured at fasting, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min.              Results:                    Twenty-four participants completed the study, of which 7 had normal glucose tolerance, 12 had abnormal glucose tolerance, and 5 had cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD). All participants had a delayed insulin response compared with normative data. All glucose tolerance groups showed appropriate and similar suppression of fasting glucagon. Four participants (17%) had mild hypoglycemic, three (13%) had moderate hypoglycemic, and eight (33%) had severe hypoglycemic. No participant with CFRD demonstrated hypoglycemic. Of the 19 participants without CFRD, 15 (79%) experienced hypoglycemic. Participants with hypoglycemic had greater peak glucose and insulin responses than those that did not have hypoglycemic, and this approached significance (p = .0625 for glucose and p = .0862 for insulin). No significant mean differences between GLP-1 and GIP release were found. There was no relationship between hypoglycemic and modulator therapy.              Conclusion:                    Postprandial hypoglycemic was unmasked by the extension of an OGTT to 3 h. Delayed and abnormal insulin release, and ineffective counter-regulatory action of glucagon may have a role in its etiology.",-1
"Validation of a deep learning computer aided system for CT based lung nodule detection, classification, and growth rate estimation in a routine clinical population","Objective:                    In this study, we evaluated a commercially available computer assisted diagnosis system (CAD). The deep learning algorithm of the CAD was trained with a lung cancer screening cohort and developed for detection, classification, quantification, and growth of actionable pulmonary nodules on chest CT scans. Here, we evaluated the CAD in a retrospective cohort of a routine clinical population.              Materials and methods:                    In total, a number of 337 scans of 314 different subjects with reported nodules of 3-30 mm in size were included into the evaluation. Two independent thoracic radiologists alternately reviewed scans with or without CAD assistance to detect, classify, segment, and register pulmonary nodules. A third, more experienced, radiologist served as an adjudicator. In addition, the cohort was analyzed by the CAD alone. The study cohort was divided into five different groups: 1) 178 CT studies without reported pulmonary nodules, 2) 95 studies with 1-10 pulmonary nodules, 23 studies from the same patients with 3) baseline and 4) follow-up studies, and 5) 18 CT studies with subsolid nodules. A reference standard for nodules was based on majority consensus with the third thoracic radiologist as required. Sensitivity, false positive (FP) rate and Dice inter-reader coefficient were calculated.              Results:                    After analysis of 470 pulmonary nodules, the sensitivity readings for radiologists without CAD and radiologist with CAD, were 71.9% (95% CI: 66.0%, 77.0%) and 80.3% (95% CI: 75.2%, 85.0%) (p < 0.01), with average FP rate of 0.11 and 0.16 per CT scan, respectively. Accuracy and kappa of CAD for classifying solid vs sub-solid nodules was 94.2% and 0.77, respectively. Average inter-reader Dice coefficient for nodule segmentation was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.96) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.95) for CAD versus readers. Mean growth percentage discrepancy of readers and CAD alone was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.02, 2.21) and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 4.99), respectively.              Conclusion:                    The applied CAD significantly increased radiologist's detection of actionable nodules yet also minimally increasing the false positive rate. The CAD can automatically classify and quantify nodules and calculate nodule growth rate in a cohort of a routine clinical population. Results suggest this Deep Learning software has the potential to assist chest radiologists in the tasks of pulmonary nodule detection and management within their routine clinical practice.",-1
Improved transient silencing of gene expression in the mosquito female Aedes aegypti,"Gene silencing using RNA interference (RNAi) has become a widely used genetic technique to study gene function in many organisms. In insects, this technique is often applied through the delivery of dsRNA. In the adult female Aedes aegypti, a main vector of human-infecting arboviruses, efficiency of gene silencing following dsRNA injection varies greatly according to targeted genes. Difficult knockdowns using dsRNA can thus hamper gene function analysis. Here, by analysing silencing of three different genes in female Ae. aegypti (p400, ago2 and E75), we show that gene silencing can indeed be dsRNA sequence dependent but different efficiencies do not correlate with dsRNA length. Our findings suggest that silencing is likely also gene dependent, probably due to gene-specific tissue expression and/or feedback mechanisms. We demonstrate that use of high doses of dsRNA can improve knockdown efficiency, and injection of a transfection reagent along with dsRNA reduces the variability in efficiency between replicates. Finally, we show that gene silencing cannot be achieved using siRNA injection in Ae. aegypti adult females. Overall, this work should help future gene function analyses using RNAi in adult females Ae. aegypti, leading toward a better understanding of physiological and infectious processes.",-1
Effect of temporal resolution on the detection of cardiac arrhythmias using HRV features and machine learning,"Objective.Arrhythmia is an abnormal cardiac rhythm that affects the pattern and rate of the heartbeat. Wearable devices with the functionality to measure and store heart rate (HR) data are growing in popularity and enable diagnosing and monitoring arrhythmia on a large scale. The typical sampling resolution of HR data available from non-medical grade wearable devices varies from seconds to several minutes depending on the device and its settings. However, the impact of sampling resolution on the performance and quality of arrhythmia detection has not yet been quantified.Approach.In this study, we investigated the detection and classification of three arrhythmias, namely atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia, from down-sampled HR data with various temporal resolution (5-, 15-, 30- and 60 s averages) in 1 h segments extracted from an annotated Holter ECG database acquired at the University of Virginia Heart Station. For the classification task, a total of 15 common heart rate variability (HRV) features were engineered based on the HR time series of each patient. Three different types of machine learning classifiers were evaluated, namely logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest.Main results.A decrease in temporal resolution drastically impacted the detection of atrial fibrillation but did not substantially affect the detection of bradycardia and tachycardia. A HR resolution up to 15 s average demonstrated reasonable performance with a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.86 for a multiclass random forest classifier.Significance.HRV features extracted from low resolution long HR recordings have the potential to increase the early detection of arrhythmias in undiagnosed individuals.",-1
"Hatching pattern and coexistence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Culicidae) in a subtropical city, Argentina, after three decades of coexistence","Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are mosquito vectors of numerous arboviruses of sanitary importance. Presently in Argentina, neither Ae. aegypti nor Ae. albopictus, have displaced the other species in the places where they coexist, since the introduction of the latter in 1998. In this study, we evaluated whether these species coexist at different scales (ovitrap, microhabitat and habitat) in the city of Eldorado, Misiones province, northeast Argentina. We also analyzed the seasonal variation and climate variables related to the delay in egg hatching of both species. Mosquitoes were collected weekly, from June 2017 to May 2018, using ovitraps placed in urban areas. We conclude that Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus coexist in the study area, at the ovitrap, microhabitat and habitat scales. Furthermore, no pronounced pattern of delayed hatching has been observed for either species; however, eggs of Ae. albopictus laid during colder weeks and less rainfall needed a greater number of immersions to hatch, while for Ae. aegypti those laid during weeks with low rainfall and high temperatures showed the longest delay in hatching response.",-1
Epigenetic Silencing of PTEN and Epi-Transcriptional Silencing of MDM2 Underlied Progression to Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Treated with Hypomethylating Agents,"In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMA) portends a poor prognosis, underscoring the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to HMA-resistance. In this study, P39 and Kasumi-1 cells and their azacitidine-resistant and decitabine-resistant sublines were evaluated comparatively with transcriptomic and methylomic analyses. Expression profiling and genome-wide methylation microarray showed downregulation of PTEN associated with DNA hypermethylation in P39 cell lines resistant to azacitidine and decitabine. This pattern of PTEN dysregulation was also confirmed in a cohort of patients failing treatment with HMA. DNA hypomethylation of MDM2 was detected with downregulation of MDM2 in HMA resistant cell lines. Long-read sequencing revealed significant RNA hypomethylation of MDM2 resulting in alternative splicing and production of a truncated MDM2 transcript in azacitidine-resistant P39 cells. The expression of this MDM2 truncated transcript was also significantly increased in HMA-resistant patients compared with HMA-responsive patients. In conclusion, epigenetic and epi-transcriptomic dysregulation of PTEN and MDM2 were associated with resistance to hypomethylating agents.",-1
"Biodiscrimination of Î±-tocopherol stereoisomers in plasma and tissues of lambs fed different proportions of all-rac-Î±-tocopheryl acetate and RRR-Î±-tocopheryl acetate1,2","A ratio of 1.36:1 in relative bioactivity of RRR-Î±-tocopheryl acetate as a natural (Nat-Î±-T) source to all-rac-Î±-tocopheryl-acetate, as a synthetic (Syn-Î±-T) source, is generally accepted. This factor also largely reflects the difference in bioavailability. However, studies indicate that neither bioavailability of Î±-tocopherol stereoisomers nor relative bioavailability between them are constant, but are dose-dependent and differ between organs. However, no information is available about how different ratios between synthetic and natural Î±-tocopherol affect bioavailability of Î±-tocopherol stereoisomers. Thirty lambs were randomly assigned to diets supplied with additives containing 5 different Syn-Î±-T to Nat-Î±-T ratios, including 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. The experiment lasted for 70 d after which the lambs were slaughtered. The amount of RRR-Î±-tocopherol generally increased in plasma and organs with increasing the proportion of Nat-Î±-T in the diet (P < 0.05). However, the relative bioavailability of RRR- and RRS-Î±-tocopherol in plasma, organs, and abdominal fat generally decreased with increasing the proportion of Nat-Î±-T in the diet (P < 0.05), whereas the other stereoisomers only showed minor changes with the exception of liver. However, a linear response was maintained between the ratio of stereoisomers in the feed and the ratio in plasma and organs. In conclusion, regardless of Syn-Î±-T to Nat-Î±-T ratio in the diets, amounts of Î±-tocopherol stereoisomers in plasma, brain, heart, lungs, and abdominal fat were in the following order: RRR > RRS, RSR, RSS > Î£2S.",-1
Emergence of associative learning in a neuromorphic inference network,"Objective. In the theoretical framework of predictive coding and active inference, the brain can be viewed as instantiating a rich generative model of the world that predicts incoming sensory data while continuously updating its parameters via minimization of prediction errors. While this theory has been successfully applied to cognitive processes-by modelling the activity of functional neural networks at a mesoscopic scale-the validity of the approach when modelling neurons as an ensemble of inferring agents, in a biologically plausible architecture, remained to be explored.Approach.We modelled a simplified cerebellar circuit with individual neurons acting as Bayesian agents to simulate the classical delayed eyeblink conditioning protocol. Neurons and synapses adjusted their activity to minimize their prediction error, which was used as the network cost function. This cerebellar network was then implemented in hardware by replicating digital neuronal elements via a low-power microcontroller.Main results. Persistent changes of synaptic strength-that mirrored neurophysiological observations-emerged via local (neurocentric) prediction error minimization, leading to the expression of associative learning. The same paradigm was effectively emulated in low-power hardware showing remarkably efficient performance compared to conventional neuromorphic architectures.Significance. These findings show that: (a) an ensemble of free energy minimizing neurons-organized in a biological plausible architecture-can recapitulate functional self-organization observed in nature, such as associative plasticity, and (b) a neuromorphic network of inference units can learn unsupervised tasks without embedding predefined learning rules in the circuit, thus providing a potential avenue to a novel form of brain-inspired artificial intelligence.",-1
Impact of long-term dietary habits on the human gut resistome in the Dutch population,"The human gut microbiome plays a central role in health and disease. Environmental factors, such as lifestyle and diet, are known to shape the gut microbiome as well as the reservoir of resistance genes that these microbes harbour; the resistome. In this study we assessed whether long-term dietary habits within a single geographical region (the Netherlands) impact the human gut resistome. Faecal samples from Dutch omnivores, pescatarians, vegetarians and vegans were analysed by metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) (n = 149) and resistome capture sequencing approach (ResCap) (n = 64). Among all diet groups, 119 and 145 unique antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected by MSS or ResCap, respectively. Five or fifteen ARGs were shared between all diet groups, based on MSS and ResCap, respectively. The total number of detected ARGs by MSS or ResCap was not significantly different between the groups. MSS also revealed that vegans have a distinct microbiome composition, compared to other diet groups. Vegans had a lower abundance of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis compared to pescatarians and a lower abundance of S. thermophilus when compared to omnivores. In summary, our study showed that long-term dietary habits are not associated with a specific resistome signature.",-1
TNFAIP3 Reduction-of-Function Drives Female Infertility and CNS Inflammation,"Women with autoimmune and inflammatory aetiologies can exhibit reduced fecundity. TNFAIP3 is a master negative regulator of inflammation, and has been linked to many inflammatory conditions by genome wide associations studies, however its role in fertility remains unknown. Here we show that mice harbouring a mild Tnfaip3 reduction-of-function coding variant (Tnfaip3 I325N) that reduces the threshold for inflammatory NF-ÎºB activation, exhibit reduced fecundity. Sub-fertility in Tnfaip3 I325N mice is associated with irregular estrous cycling, low numbers of ovarian secondary follicles, impaired mammary gland development and insulin resistance. These pathological features are associated with infertility in human subjects. Transplantation of Tnfaip3 I325N ovaries, mammary glands or pancreatic islets into wild-type recipients rescued estrous cycling, mammary branching and hyperinsulinemia respectively, pointing towards a cell-extrinsic hormonal mechanism. Examination of hypothalamic brain sections revealed increased levels of microglial activation with reduced levels of luteinizing hormone. TNFAIP3 coding variants may offer one contributing mechanism for the cause of sub-fertility observed across otherwise healthy populations as well as for the wide variety of auto-inflammatory conditions to which TNFAIP3 is associated. Further, TNFAIP3 represents a molecular mechanism that links heightened immunity with neuronal inflammatory homeostasis. These data also highlight that tuning-up immunity with TNFAIP3 comes with the potentially evolutionary significant trade-off of reduced fertility.",-1
VEGF-targeting drugs for the treatment of retinal neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microangiopathic complication of diabetes mellitus, representing a major cause of visual impairment in developed countries. Proliferative DR (PDR) represents the last stage of this extremely complex retinal disease, characterized by the development of neovascularization induced by the abnormal production and release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The term VEGF includes different isoforms; VEGF-A represents one of the most important pathogenic factors of DR. Anti-VEGF intravitreal therapies radically changed the outcome of DR, due to combined anti-angiogenic and anti-edematous activities. Nowadays, several anti-VEGF molecules exist, characterized by different pharmacological features and duration. With respect to PDR, although anti-VEGF treatments represented a fundamental step forward in the management of this dramatic complication, a big debate is present in the literature regarding the role of anti-VEGF as substitute of panretinal photocoagulation or if these two approaches may be used in combination. In the present review, we provided an update on VEGF isoforms and their role in DR pathogenesis, on current anti-VEGF molecules and emerging new drugs, and on the current management strategies of PDR. There is an overall agreement regarding the relative advantage provided by anti-VEGF, especially looking at the management of PDR patients requiring vitrectomy, with respect to laser. Based on the current data, laser approaches might be avoided when a perfectly planned anti-VEGF therapeutic strategy can be adopted. Conversely, laser treatment may have a role for those patients unable to guarantee enough compliance to anti-VEGF injections.Key messagesVEGF increased production, stimulated by retinal hypoperfusion and ischaemia, is a major pathogenic factor of neovascular complication onset in diabetic retinopathy and of DR stages progression.Nowadays, several anti-VEGF molecules are available in clinical practice and other molecules are currently under investigation. Each anti-VEGF molecule is characterized by different targets and may interact with multiple biochemical pathways within the eye.All the data agreed in considering anti-VEGF molecules as a first line choice for the management of diabetic retinopathy. Laser treatments may have a role in selected advanced cases and for those patients unable to guarantee enough compliance to intravitreal treatments schemes.",-1
Promoter Methylation Regulates ApoA-I Gene Transcription in Chicken Abdominal Adipose Tissue,"As a central constituent of HDL (high-density lipoprotein), apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) has a vital function in lipid metabolism. Our previous studies confirmed that ApoA-I was differentially expressed in the adipose tissue of the abdomen of lean and fat broilers. The aim of the current work was to evaluate whether the transcription of ApoA-I in chicken abdominal adipose tissue was regulated by DNA methylation. The methylation status of ApoA-I promoter CpG island (PCGI) and promoter non-CpG island (PNCGI) as well as the ApoA-I expression level in adipose tissue of lean and fat broilers were determined using Sequenom MassARRAY and real-time PCR. The correlation analysis results showed that the methylation level of PCGI and the ApoA-I mRNA expression level were negatively correlated. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to assess the methylation level of ApoA-I promoter in the ICP1 cells treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR: an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase). The result showed that 5-Aza-CdR caused a reduction in the methylation level of the ApoA-I promoter, thereby causing an increase in expression of the ApoA-I mRNA. Meanwhile, luciferase reporter assays indicated that in vitro methylation of the ApoA-I promoter containing CpG island with CpG methyltransferase led to transcriptional repression. Furthermore, the noticeable activation of NRF1 on ApoA-I transcription was largely enhanced by the demethylation of the ApoA-I PCGI region. These observations indicated that the differential expression of ApoA-I gene in the adipose tissue of broilers could be mediated by transcription regulation, at least in part by DNA methylation in its PCGI region.",-1
Chitosan oligosaccharide mitigates kidney injury in prediabetic rats by improving intestinal barrier and renal autophagy,"Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) not only increases the risk of metabolic syndrome but also initiates kidney injury. Lipid accumulation-induced systemic low-grade inflammation is an upstream mechanism of kidney injury associated with prediabetes. Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) provides potent anti-obesity effects through several mechanisms including fecal lipid excretion. In this study, we investigated the effects of COS on the prevention of obesity-related complications and its ability to confer renoprotection in a prediabetic model. Rats fed on a HFD developed obesity, glucose intolerance and kidney dysfunction. COS intervention successfully ameliorated these conditions (p < 0.05) by attenuating intestinal lipid absorption and the renal inflammation-autophagy-apoptosis axis. A novel anti-inflammatory effect of COS had been demonstrated by the strengthening of intestinal barrier integrity via calcium-sensing receptor (p < 0.05). The use of COS as a supplement may be useful in reducing prediabetic complications especially renal injury and the risk of type 2 diabetes.",-1
Effect of Aqueous Cinnamon Extract on the Postprandial Glycemia Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Cinnamon is a spice used in traditional cuisine that has been investigated due to hypoglycemic properties. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of aqueous cinnamon extract on postprandial glycemia levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) adults. This clinical trial enrolled 36 adults with DM2, randomly allocated in two groups: the control group (n = 18) took only an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the intervention group (n = 18) took OGTT immediately followed by aqueous cinnamon extract (6 g/100 mL) ingestion. Blood glucose levels were measured on fasting and after 30, 60, 90 and 120 min in both groups. The chemical analysis of the aqueous cinnamon extract included total phenols content determination and antioxidant activity assessment through FRAP and DPPH methods. The data reveal that aqueous cinnamon extract ingestion did not show a significant difference in the incremental area under the curve (p = 0.834), maximum glucose concentration (p = 0.527) and glucose concentration variation (p = 0.873) compared with the control group. Cinnamon extract possess a total phenol content of 1554.9 mg/L gallic acid equivalent and a strong antioxidant capacity, revealed by the DPPH (5125.0 Âµmol Trolox/L) and FRAP (3658.8 Âµmol Trolox/L) tests. Aqueous cinnamon extract did not significantly influence postprandial glucose response in diabetic patients during an OGTT.",-1
Genome-wide association study of VHSV-resistance trait in Paralichthys olivaceus,"In flounder aquaculture, selective breeding plays a vital role in the development of disease-resistant traits and animals with high growth rates. Moreover, superior animals are required to achieve high profits. Unlike growth-related traits, disease-resistant experiments need to be conducted in a controlled environment, as the improper measurement of traits often leads to low genetic correlation and incorrect estimation of breeding values. In this study, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) resistance was studied using a genome-wide association study (GWAS), and the genetic parameters were estimated. Genotyping was performed using a high-quality 70 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) AffymetrixÂ® AxiomÂ® myDesignâ?Genotyping Array of olive flounder. A heritability of â?.18 for resistance to VHSV was estimated using genomic information of the fish. According to the GWAS, significant SNPs were detected in chromosomes 21, 24, and contig AGQT02032065.1. Three SNPs showed significance at the genome-wide level (p < 1 Ã 10-6), while others showed significance above the suggestive cutoff (p < 1 Ã 10-4). The 3% phenotypic variation was explained by the highest significant SNP, named AX-419319631. Of the important genes for disease resistance, SNPs were associated with plcg1, epha4, clstn2, pik3cb, hes6, meis3, prx6, cep164, siae, and kirrel3b. Most of the genes associated with these SNPs have been previously reported with respect to viral entry, propagation, and immune mechanisms. Therefore, our study provides helpful information regarding VHSV resistance in olive flounder, which can be used for breeding applications.",-1
"Effects of Food on the Pharmacokinetic Properties of Surufatinib: A Phase I, Single-dose, Randomized, Open-label Crossover Study in Healthy Subjects","Purpose:                    Surufatinib is a potent and orally active small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFRs 1 to 3, FGFR-1, and CSF-1R, and thus may exert antitumor and antiangiogenic effects. The objective of this study was to determine the tolerability and effects of food intake on the pharmacokinetic properties of surufatinib in healthy Chinese subjects.              Methods:                    A total of 24 healthy Chinese male subjects aged between 18 and 55 years were enrolled. Subjects were administered a single dose of surufatinib 250-mg capsules in the fasted and fed states in succession. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed through the collection of blood samples at predose and at several time points after surufatinib administration. Tolerability assessments comprised physical examination including vital sign measurements, laboratory testing, and ECG to determine adverse events (AEs).              Findings:                    The 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios of AUC0-t and AUC0-â?in the fasted and fed states was within 0.80 to 1.25; and for Cmax, within 0.70 to 1.43, indicating that food had no effect on the bioavailability of surufatinib in these healthy Chinese male subjects. Food intake delayed the time to peak absorption of surufatinib, as the median Tmax in the fed state was longer than that in the fasted state (4.0 vs 2.0 h). Surufatinib was marginally excreted from urine (mean [SD] cumulative excretion fraction, 1.2% [0.4%]). AEs occurred in 7 of the 24 subjects (29.2%) and included upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, merycism, intervertebral disc protrusion, influenza-like disease, hematuria, prostatitis, and elevated blood urea nitrogen. All AEs were grade 1 or 2.              Implications:                    The bioavailability of surufatinib was not affected by food intake prior to dosing. However, food intake led to delated Tmax of surufatinib. The tolerability of a single oral dose of surufatinib 250 mg in the fasted and fed states was favorable in these healthy Chinese male subjects. These results indicate that surufatinib capsules could be administered before or after meals. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02320409.",-1

Identification of active compounds and molecular mechanisms of Dalbergia tsoi Merr.et Chun to accelerate wound healing,"As a traditional Chinese medicine, Dalbergia tsoi Merr.et Chun (JZX) has been used for the treatment of wounds since ancient times. However, the active compounds and molecular mechanisms of JZX in the acceleration of wound healing are still unknown. Herein, we explored the main active compounds and key molecular mechanisms by which JZX accelerates wound healing. The ethanol extract of JZX was subjected to UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis to identify the main compounds. The pharmacological effect of JZX on wound healing was evaluated using a mouse excision wound model. Network pharmacology was utilized to predict the effective compounds and related signal transduction pathways of JZX that were involved in accelerating wound healing. The predicted key signaling pathways were then validated by immunohistochemical analysis. Interactions between the active compounds and therapeutic targets were confirmed by molecular docking analysis. JZX accelerated wound healing, improved tissue quality, and inhibited inflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, our results suggested that the active components of JZX, such as butin, eriodyctiol, and formononetin, are the key compounds that facilitate wound treatment. Our studies also indicated that JZX accelerated wound healing by regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inducing the expression of TGF-Î²1, FGF2, VEGFA, ECM1, and Î±-SMA at different stages of skin wound healing. The JZX extract accelerates wound healing by reducing inflammation and inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and promoting the expression of growth factors, suggesting that JZX has potential clinical applicability in wound treatment.",-1
Application of Deep Learning Models for Automated Identification of Parkinson's Disease: A Review (2011-2021),"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 6 million people globally. Although there are symptomatic treatments that can increase the survivability of the disease, there are no curative treatments. The prevalence of PD and disability-adjusted life years continue to increase steadily, leading to a growing burden on patients, their families, society and the economy. Dopaminergic medications can significantly slow down the progression of PD when applied during the early stages. However, these treatments often become less effective with the disease progression. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial for immediate interventions so that the patients can remain self-sufficient for the longest period of time possible. Unfortunately, diagnoses are often late, due to factors such as a global shortage of neurologists skilled in early PD diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools, based on artificial intelligence methods, that can perform automated diagnosis of PD, are gaining attention from healthcare services. In this review, we have identified 63 studies published between January 2011 and July 2021, that proposed deep learning models for an automated diagnosis of PD, using various types of modalities like brain analysis (SPECT, PET, MRI and EEG), and motion symptoms (gait, handwriting, speech and EMG). From these studies, we identify the best performing deep learning model reported for each modality and highlight the current limitations that are hindering the adoption of such CAD tools in healthcare. Finally, we propose new directions to further the studies on deep learning in the automated detection of PD, in the hopes of improving the utility, applicability and impact of such tools to improve early detection of PD globally.",-1
Investigation of early biochemical alterations in myocardia of the diabetic db/db mice by FTIR microspectroscopy combined with machine learning,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM) is a serious complication of diabetes that affects about 12% of the diabetic population. Sensitive detection of diabetes-induced biochemical changes in the heart before symptoms appear can assist clinicians in developing targeted treatment plans and forensic pathologists in making accurate postmortem diagnoses. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy-based approach allows for the analysis of the sample biomolecular composition and variations. In the current study, the myocardial tissues of mouse models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at various ages (7, 12, and 21 weeks) were analyzed using FTIR microspectroscopy (FTIRM) in combination with machine learning algorithms. The carbonyl esters, olefinic=CH and CH2 groups of lipids, total lipids, saccharides, and Î²-sheet to Î±-helix conformational transition in proteins increased significantly in diabetic mice myocardial tissues compared to healthy mice. Furthermore, partial least-squares discriminant analysis and random forest-guided partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed the time-dependent progression of the spectral lipidomic profiles during the development of DbCM. Finally, a random forest classifier was developed for diagnosing DbCM, with 97.1% accuracy. This study demonstrates that FTIRM is a novel method for monitoring early biochemical changes in the myocardia of mice with T2DM.",-1
Multimodality and Computational Intelligence-Enabled Intercultural Communicative Competence of College-English-Teaching Students,"With the intensification of global economic integration, international exchanges have become increasingly frequent, and employers have put forward higher requirements for ICC (Intercultural Communication Competence) of college students. In this paper, in ICC mode, the multimodal evaluation model framework of ICC is constructed by using multimodal theory. The evaluation object is Chinese college students, the evaluation media are computers and networks, and the evaluation contents include knowledge, consciousness, speculation, attitude, skills, and strategies of cross-cultural communication. The research results will help Chinese college students overcome their fears during the cross-cultural communications, meanwhile,can strengthen the cultivation of ICC for students as well. After comprehensive consideration of various influencing factors, comparing the overall teaching quality of universities of different grades or the same grade can objectively reflect the overall teaching level of the university, hoping to provide some reference for the application of multimodal discourse analysis theory and CET (college English teaching).",-1
Increased fatty acid metabolism attenuates cardiac resistance to Î²-adrenoceptor activation via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species: A potential mechanism of hypoglycemia-induced myocardial injury in diabetes,"The mechanism of severe hypoglycemia (SH)-induced cardiovascular disease in diabetes remains unknown. Our previous study found that SH inhibits cardiac function and lipid metabolism in diabetic mice. Conversely, in nondiabetic mice, SH does not induce cardiac dysfunction but promotes cardiac lipid metabolism. This study aims to clarify the effect of increased fatty acid metabolism on the resistance of cardiomyocytes to Î²-adrenoceptor activation during hypoglycemia in diabetes. Results revealed that cardiomyocytes with enhanced lipid metabolism were more vulnerable to damage due to Î²-adrenoceptor activation, which presented as decreased cell viability, disorder of mitochondrial structure, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, dysfunction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, nonapoptotic damage, and accumulation of ROS and calcium from mitochondria to cytoplasm, all of which were partially reversed by mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO. The SH-induced cardiac dysfunction, and reduction of myocardial energy metabolism in diabetic mice were rescued by Mito-TEMPO. Our findings indicate that high fatty acid metabolism crippled cardiac resistance to Î²-adrenoceptor hyperactivation, with mitochondrial ROS playing a pivotal role in this process. Reducing mitochondrial ROS in diabetes could disrupt this synergistic effect and prevent poor cardiac outcomes caused by SH.",-1
Non-coding RNAs as emerging regulators and biomarkers in colorectal cancer,"CRC is the third most common cancer occurring worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. In the year 2020, 1,931,590 new cases of CRC and 935,173 deaths were reported. The last two decades have witnessed an intensive study of noncoding RNAs and their implications in various pathological conditions including cancer. Noncoding RNAs such as miRNAs, tsRNAs, piRNAs, lncRNAs, pseudogenes, and circRNAs have emerged as promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in preclinical studies of cancer. Some of these noncoding RNAs have also been shown as promising therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In this review, we have discussed the emerging roles of various types of noncoding RNAs in CRC and their future implications in colorectal cancer management and research.",-1
MicroRNA hsa-miR-657 promotes retinoblastoma malignancy by inhibiting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha expression,"Retinoblastoma is a familial inherited embryonic neuroretinal malignancy with a low survival rate and poor prognosis. Our study aimed to evaluate the potential interaction between microRNA miR-657 and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) in retinoblastoma. Expression of miR-657 and PPARA was analyzed in retinoblastoma tissues and cells using RT-qPCR. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were measured in retinoblastoma cell lines, and xenografting experiments were performed using nude mice. Our study showed that miR-657 expression was markedly increased, whereas that of PPARA was markedly decreased in retinoblastoma. Additionally, PPARA knockdown enhanced the development of retinoblastoma. miR-657 enhanced the retinoblastoma tumorigenesis by directly inhibiting PPARA expression, suggesting that PPARA targeting by miR-657 facilitates retinoblastoma development by enhancing cell growth. This study provides novel insights into the miR-657- and PPARA-mediated mechanisms underlying retinoblastoma progression and suggests that the interaction between miR-657 and PPARA may serve as an effective target for therapeutic intervention.",-1
Potentially Probiotic Limosilactobacillus fermentum Fruit-Derived Strains Alleviate Cardiometabolic Disorders and Gut Microbiota Impairment in Male Rats Fed a High-Fat Diet,"High-fat diet (HFD) consumption is a risk factor for dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, and arterial hypertension linked with gut dysbiosis. Probiotic administration has been suggested as a safe therapeutic strategy for gut microbiota modulation and treatment and/or prevention of cardiometabolic disorders. Here, we assessed the effects of a potentially probiotic formulation containing strains of the Limosilactobacillus (L.) fermentum 139, 263, and 296 on the cardiometabolic disorders and gut microbiota derangements provoked by the HFD consumption. Male Wistar rats were allocated into control diet (CTL, n = 6), HFD (n = 6), and HFD receiving L. fermentum formulation (HFD-LF, n = 6) groups for 4 weeks. L. fermentum formulation (109 colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml of each strain) was daily administered by oral gavage. After 4-week follow-up, biochemical measurements, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), sympathetic tone, and gut microbiota composition were evaluated. HFD consumption for 4 weeks increased lipid profile, insulin resistance, sympathetic tone, and blood pressure and impaired gut microbiota composition in male rats. Administration of L. fermentum formulation improved the gut microbiota composition, lipid profile, insulin resistance, autonomic dysfunction, and BP in rats fed with a HFD. Administration of a potentially fruit-derived probiotic formulation of L. fermentum strains improved gut microbiota composition and alleviated hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and sympathetic hyperactivity and increased BP in rats fed a HFD. Our findings may encourage the development of randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of L. fermentum treatment in subjects with cardiometabolic disorders.",-1
Dexmedetomidine reduces propofol-induced hippocampal neuron injury by modulating the miR-377-5p/Arc pathway,"Background:                    Propofol and dexmedetomidine (DEX) are widely used in general anesthesia, and exert toxic and protective effects on hippocampal neurons, respectively. The study sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms of DEX-mediated neuroprotection against propofol-induced hippocampal neuron injury in mouse brains.              Methods:                    Hippocampal neurons of mice and HT22 cells were treated with propofol, DEX, and propofol+DEX. In addition, transfection of miR-377-5p mimics or inhibitors was performed in HT22 cells. Neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by a means of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) or Hochest 33,258 staining; Arc positive expression in hippocampus tissues was detected using a microscope in immunohistochemistry assays; miRNA-377-5p expression was quantified by RT-qPCR; the protein levels of Arc, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B were determined using western blot; Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to detect the viability and apoptotic rate of the neurons; methylation analysis in the miR-377-5p promoter was performed through methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) assay; dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm whether Arc was under targeted regulation of miR-377-5p.              Results:                    In the current study, both in vitro and in vivo, propofol treatment induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis and suppressed cell viability. DNMT3A and DNMT3B expression levels were decreased following propofol treatment, resulting in lowered methylation in the miR-377-5p promoter region and then enhanced expression of miR-377-5p, leading to a decrease in the expression of downstream Arc. Conversely, the expression levels of DNMT3A and DNMT3B were increased following DEX treatment, thus methylation in miR-377-5p promoter region was improved, and miR-377-5p expression was decreased, leading to an increase in the expression of downstream Arc. Eventually, DEX pretreatment protected hippocampal neurons against propofol-induced neurotoxicity by recovering the expression levels of DNMT3A, miR-377-5p, and Arc to the normal levels. Additionally, DNMT3A knockdown improved miR-377-5p expression but reduced Arc expression, and DNMT3A overexpression exerted the opposite effects. Dual luciferase reporter assay revealed a binding target between miR-377-5p and Arc 3'UTR. The neuroprotective effect of DEX against propofol-induced neuronal apoptosis was diminished after Arc knockdown. Silencing Arc independently triggered the apoptosis of HT22 cells, which was alleviated through transfection of miR-377-5p inhibitors.              Conclusions:                    DEX reduced propofol-induced hippocampal neuron injury via the miR-377-5p/Arc signaling pathway.",-1
Advanced Glycation End Products and Diabetes Mellitus: Mechanisms and Perspectives,"Persistent hyperglycemic state in type 2 diabetes mellitus leads to the initiation and progression of non-enzymatic glycation reaction with proteins and lipids and nucleic acids. Glycation reaction leads to the generation of a heterogeneous group of chemical moieties known as advanced glycated end products (AGEs), which play a central role in the pathophysiology of diabetic complications. The engagement of AGEs with its chief cellular receptor, RAGE, activates a myriad of signaling pathways such as MAPK/ERK, TGF-Î², JNK, and NF-ÎºB, leading to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammation. The downstream consequences of the AGEs/RAGE axis involve compromised insulin signaling, perturbation of metabolic homeostasis, RAGE-induced pancreatic beta cell toxicity, and epigenetic modifications. The AGEs/RAGE signaling instigated modulation of gene transcription is profoundly associated with the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pathogenesis of diabetic complications. In this review, we will summarize the exogenous and endogenous sources of AGEs, their role in metabolic dysfunction, and current understandings of AGEs/RAGE signaling cascade. The focus of this review is to recapitulate the role of the AGEs/RAGE axis in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications. Furthermore, we present an overview of future perspectives to offer new therapeutic interventions to intervene with the AGEs/RAGE signaling pathway and to slow down the progression of diabetes-related complications.",-1
Intensity and mechanisms of deltamethrin and permethrin resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.l. populations in southern Benin,"Background:                    Insecticide resistance is threatening the effectiveness of efforts to control malaria vectors in Benin. This study explores the levels and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in An. gambiae s.l. to pyrethroids.              Methods:                    Larvae were collected from August 2017 to July 2018 in five communes in southern Benin (Adjohoun, Allada, Bohicon, Cotonou, and Porto-Novo) representing diverse ecological regions, and were reared in Benin's insectary. Two- to five-day-old female mosquitoes from each district were exposed to multiple doses of deltamethrin and permethrin (1Ã, 2Ã, 5Ã, and 10Ã) using the WHO insecticide resistance intensity bioassay. The effect of pre-exposure to the synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), was also tested at different pyrethroid doses. Molecular allele frequencies of kdr (1014F) and ace-1R (119S) insecticide resistance mutations and levels of detoxification enzymes were determined for mosquitoes sampled from each study area.              Results:                    An. gambiae s.l. were resistant to pyrethroid-only exposure up to 10Ã the diagnostic doses in all the study sites for both deltamethrin and permethrin. Mortality was significantly higher in An. gambiae s.l. pre-exposed to PBO followed by exposure to deltamethrin or permethrin compared to mosquitoes exposed to deltamethrin or permethrin only (p < 0.001). The difference in mortality between deltamethrin only and PBO plus deltamethrin was the smallest in Cotonou (16-64%) and the greatest in Bohicon (12-93%). The mortality difference between permethrin only and PBO plus permethrin was the smallest in Cotonou (44-75%) and the greatest in Bohicon (22-72%). In all the study sites, the kdr resistance allele (1014F) frequency was high (75-100%), while the ace-1 resistance allele (G119S) frequency was low (0-3%). Analysis of the metabolic enzymatic activity of An. gambiae s.l. showed overexpression of nonspecific esterases and glutathione S-transferases (GST) in all study sites. In contrast to the PBO results, oxidase expression was low and was similar to the susceptible An. gambiae s.s. Kisumu strain in all sites.              Conclusion:                    There is high-intensity resistance to pyrethroids in southern Benin. However, pre-exposure to PBO significantly increased susceptibility to the pyrethroids in the different An. gambiae s.l. populations sampled. The use of PBO insecticide-treated bed nets may help maintain the gains in An. gambiae (s.l.) control in southern Benin.",-1
Key Genes and Biochemical Networks in Various Brain Regions Affected in Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most complicated progressive neurodegenerative brain disorders, affecting millions of people around the world. Ageing remains one of the strongest risk factors associated with the disease and the increasing trend of the ageing population globally has significantly increased the pressure on healthcare systems worldwide. The pathogenesis of AD is being extensively investigated, yet several unknown key components remain. Therefore, we aimed to extract new knowledge from existing data. Ten gene expression datasets from different brain regions including the hippocampus, cerebellum, entorhinal, frontal and temporal cortices of 820 AD cases and 626 healthy controls were analyzed using the robust rank aggregation (RRA) method. Our results returned 1713 robust differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between five brain regions of AD cases and healthy controls. Subsequent analysis revealed pathways that were altered in each brain region, of which the GABAergic synapse pathway and the retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathway were shared between all AD affected brain regions except the cerebellum, which is relatively less sensitive to the effects of AD. Furthermore, we obtained common robust DEGs between these two pathways and predicted three miRNAs as potential candidates targeting these genes; hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-106a-5p and hsa-mir-373-3p. Three transcription factors (TFs) were also identified as the potential upstream regulators of the robust DEGs; ELK-1, GATA1 and GATA2. Our results provide the foundation for further research investigating the role of these pathways in AD pathogenesis, and potential application of these miRNAs and TFs as therapeutic and diagnostic targets.",-1
"A pilot study of visceral fat and its association with adipokines, stool calprotectin and symptoms in patients with diverticulosis","Background:                    Complications of diverticular disease are increasingly common, possibly linked to increasing obesity. Visceral fat could contribute to the development of symptomatic diverticular disease through its pro-inflammatory effects.              Objective:                    The study had 2 aims. A) to develop a semi-automated algorithm to measure abdominal adipose tissue from 2-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data; B) to use this to determine if visceral fat was associated with bowel symptoms and inflammatory markers in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic diverticular disease.              Design:                    An observational study measuring visceral fat using MRI together with serum adiponectin, leptin, stool calprotectin and patient-reported somatisation and bowel habit.              Setting:                    Medical and imaging research centres of a university hospital.              Participants:                    MRI scans were performed on 55 patients after an overnight fast measuring abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue volumes together with small bowel water content (SBWC). Blood and stool samples were collected and patients kept a 2 week stool diary and completed a somatisation questionnaire.              Main outcome measures:                    Difference in the volume of visceral fat between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.              Results:                    There were no significant differences in visceral (p = 0.98) or subcutaneous adipose (p = 0.60) tissue between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. However measured fat volumes were associated with serum adipokines. Adiponectin showed an inverse correlation with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (Spearman Ï = -0.5, p = 0.0003), which correlated negatively with SBWC (Ï = -0.3, p = 0.05). Leptin correlated positively with subcutaneous adipose tissue (Ï = 0.8, p < 0.0001). Overweight patients (BMI > 25 kgm-2) showed a moderate correlation between calprotectin and VAT (Ï = 0.3, p = 0.05). Somatization scores were significantly higher in symptomatic patients (p < 0.0003).              Conclusions:                    Increasing visceral fat is associated with lower serum adiponectin and increased faecal calprotectin suggesting a pro-inflammatory effect which may predispose to the development of complications of diverticulosis.",-1
AGEs induce epithelial to mesenchymal transformation of human peritoneal mesothelial cells via upregulation of STAT3,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in peritoneum was induced during peritoneal dialysis (PD), which finally caused progressive fibrosis. However, the underlying mechanisms were not well elucidated. We established advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)-induced EMT model using primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). The working concentration and time of AGEs were optimized. Then the expression and activation signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a key factor of EMT in cancer, were detected. The regulation of STAT3 by miRNA was also explored. 50 Î¼g/ml AGEs treatment for 24 h can successfully induce EMT in HPMCs. AGEs treatment upregulated and activated STAT3. miRNA-454, potentially targeting STAT3, was down-regulated in AGEs-treated HPMCs. Overexpression of miRNA-454 prevented AGEs- induced EMT in HPMCs. AGEs induce epithelial to mesenchymal transformation of Human peritoneal mesothelial cells via upregulation of STAT3.",-1
Deep learning with self-supervision and uncertainty regularization to count fish in underwater images,"Effective conservation actions require effective population monitoring. However, accurately counting animals in the wild to inform conservation decision-making is difficult. Monitoring populations through image sampling has made data collection cheaper, wide-reaching and less intrusive but created a need to process and analyse this data efficiently. Counting animals from such data is challenging, particularly when densely packed in noisy images. Attempting this manually is slow and expensive, while traditional computer vision methods are limited in their generalisability. Deep learning is the state-of-the-art method for many computer vision tasks, but it has yet to be properly explored to count animals. To this end, we employ deep learning, with a density-based regression approach, to count fish in low-resolution sonar images. We introduce a large dataset of sonar videos, deployed to record wild Lebranche mullet schools (Mugil liza), with a subset of 500 labelled images. We utilise abundant unlabelled data in a self-supervised task to improve the supervised counting task. For the first time in this context, by introducing uncertainty quantification, we improve model training and provide an accompanying measure of prediction uncertainty for more informed biological decision-making. Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of our proposed counting framework through testing it on a recent benchmark dataset of high-resolution annotated underwater images from varying habitats (DeepFish). From experiments on both contrasting datasets, we demonstrate our network outperforms the few other deep learning models implemented for solving this task. By providing an open-source framework along with training data, our study puts forth an efficient deep learning template for crowd counting aquatic animals thereby contributing effective methods to assess natural populations from the ever-increasing visual data.",-1
Fair payments for effective environmental conservation,"Global efforts for biodiversity protection and land use-based greenhouse gas mitigation call for increases in the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental conservation. Incentive-based policy instruments are key tools for meeting these goals, yet their effectiveness might be undermined by such factors as social norms regarding whether payments are considered fair. We investigated the causal link between equity and conservation effort with a randomized real-effort experiment in forest conservation with 443 land users near a tropical forest national park in the Vietnamese Central Annamites, a global biodiversity hotspot. The experiment introduced unjustified payment inequality based on luck, in contradiction of local fairness norms that were measured through responses to vignettes. Payment inequality was perceived as less fair than payment equality. In agreement with our preregistered hypotheses, participants who were disadvantaged by unequal payments exerted significantly less conservation effort than other participants receiving the same payment under an equal distribution. No effect was observed for participants advantaged by inequality. Thus, equity effects on effort can have consequences for the effectiveness and efficiency of incentive-based conservation instruments. Furthermore, we show that women exerted substantially more conservation effort than men, and that increasing payment size unexpectedly reduced effort. This emphasizes the need to consider social comparisons, local equity norms, and gender in environmental policies using monetary incentives to motivate behavioral change.",-1
"Evaluation of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus Mosquitoes Competence to Oropouche virus Infection","The emergence of new human viral pathogens and re-emergence of several diseases are of particular concern in the last decades. Oropouche orthobunyavirus (OROV) is an arbovirus endemic to South and Central America tropical regions, responsible to several epidemic events in the last decades. There is little information regarding the ability of OROV to be transmitted by urban/peri-urban mosquitoes, which has limited the predictability of the emergence of permanent urban transmission cycles. Here, we evaluated the ability of OROV to infect, replicate, and be transmitted by three anthropophilic and urban species of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. We show that OROV is able to infect and efficiently replicate when systemically injected in all three species tested, but not when orally ingested. Moreover, we find that, once OROV replication has occurred in the mosquito body, all three species were able to transmit the virus to immunocompromised mice during blood feeding. These data provide evidence that OROV is restricted by the midgut barrier of three major urban mosquito species, but, if this restriction is overcome, could be efficiently transmitted to vertebrate hosts. This poses a great risk for the emergence of permanent urban cycles and geographic expansion of OROV to other continents.",-1
Combined over-expression of two cytochrome P450 genes exacerbates the fitness cost of pyrethroid resistance in the major African malaria vector Anopheles funestus,"Metabolic resistance driven by multiple P450 genes is worsening insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. However, it remains unclear whether such multiple over-expression imposes an additive fitness cost in the vectors. Here, we showed that two highly over-expressed P450 genes (CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b) combine to impose additive fitness costs in pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles funestus. Genotyping of the CYP6P9b resistance allele in hybrid mosquitoes from a pyrethroid-resistant FUMOZ-R and the susceptible FANG strains revealed that this gene imposes a fitness cost in resistant mosquitoes similar to CYP6P9a. Homozygote susceptible CYP6P9b_S (SS) significantly lay more eggs than the resistant (OR = 2.2, P = 0.04) and with greater hatching rate (p < 0.04). Homozygote resistant larvae CYP6P9b_R (RR) developed significantly slower than homozygote susceptible from L1-L4 (Ï2 = 7.2; P = 0.007) with a late pupation observed for RR compared to both heterozygotes and homozygotes susceptible (Ï2 = 11.17; P = 0.0008). No difference was observed between genotypes for adult longevity with no change in allele frequency and gene expression across the lifespan. Furthermore, we established that CYP6P9b combines with CYP6P9a to additively exacerbate the fitness cost of pyrethroid resistance with a greater reduction in fecundity/fertility and increased developmental time of double homozygote resistant mosquitoes. Moreover, an increased proportion of double homozygote susceptible individuals was noted over 10 generations in the insecticide-free environment (Ï2 = 6.3; P = 0.01) suggesting a reversal to susceptibility in the absence of selection. Such greater fitness cost imposed by multiple P450 genes shows that resistance management strategy based on rotation could help slow the spread of resistance.",-1
miR-495-3p depresses cell proliferation and migration by downregulating HMGB1 in colorectal cancer,"Background:                    MicroRNAs play an important role in the genesis and progression of tumours, including colorectal cancer (CRC), which has a high morbidity and mortality rate. In this research, the role of miR-495-3p and HMGB1 in CRC was investigated.              Methods:                    We performed qRT-PCR to detect the expression of miR-495-3p in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines. Functional experiments, such as CCK-8, EdU, Transwell and apoptosis assays, were conducted to explore the effects of miR-495-3p on the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of CRC cells in vitro. Then, database prediction, dual-luciferase reporter gene assays and functional experiments verified the role of the miR-495-3p target gene HMGB1 in CRC. Finally, rescue experiments were performed to investigate whether overexpression of HMGB1 could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-495-3p on CRC cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro.              Results:                    miR-495-3p was downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines, inhibited the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells and promoted cell apoptosis. Database prediction and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays showed that HMGB1 was the downstream target gene of miR-495-3p. We finally demonstrated that miR-495-3p inhibited CRC cell proliferation by targeting HMGB1 in vitro and in vivo.              Conclusion:                    Our research shows that miR-495-3p inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer by downregulating the expression of HMGB1, which indicates that miR-495-3p may become a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.",-1
Role of Occupational Therapy in Facilitating Participation Among Caregivers of People With Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review,"Importance:                    Caregivers play a critical role in facilitating the performance of people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Knowledge on how occupational therapy practitioners can mitigate the negative effects of caregiving is needed to enable caregiver participation.              Objective:                    To explore the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice for caregivers of people with PD to facilitate or maintain their participation in the caregiver role.              Data sources:                    We conducted a systematic review of the literature published in CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and OTseeker between 2011 and 2019. Article reference lists were also hand searched for additional articles. Study Selection and Data Collection: Articles were screened and evaluated using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The review was conducted in accordance with steps outlined by the American Occupational Therapy Association's Evidence-Based Practice Project.              Findings:                    Six articles met the inclusion criteria. Interventions in each article were distinct, prohibiting theme development. Overall, the strength of evidence was low, and the risk of bias was high. None of the studies included in this review were obtained from the occupational therapy literature.              Conclusions and relevance:                    Little evidence is available to support interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice for caregivers of people with PD. Existing evidence suggests that interventions need to be flexible (e.g., in terms of time, cost, and delivery method) and tailored to the unique needs of this population. What This Article Adds: There is a continued need to develop occupational therapy interventions that support participation in the caregiving role for caregivers of people with PD.",-1
Capecitabine-induced severe diabetes and hypokalemia: a case report,"Background:                    Capecitabine is widely used in chemotherapy for breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers. The frequent adverse reactions of capecitabine mainly include gastrointestinal side effects, anemia, and cardiovascular toxicity. Here, we report a rare case of severe hyperglycemia and hypokalemia during long-term treatment with capecitabine.              Case presentation:                    A 48-year-old Chinese female was hospitalized with the complaint of breathlessness and weakness after activity, for 1 month. Her past history is significant for a diagnosis of right-sided breast cancer 7 years ago. She underwent right mastectomy, following which capecitabine was started 1.5 years prior to the current admission as part of her primary treatment at the discovery of systemic osseous metastasis. Her fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were quite normal 7 months ago but increased to 15.3 mmol/L and 11.2%, respectively, at the present admission. Her serum potassium level was as low as 2.5 mmol/L. Plasma autoantibodies related to islets and insulin were all negative. Capecitabine was discontinued, and an insulin pump and potassium supplement were given after admission. Her blood sugar and potassium levels returned to their normal ranges soon. Self-injection of insulin was withdrawn completely at 2 months after discharge, and no oral hypoglycemic agents were added. Her plasma glucose and electrolyte levels were at normal levels at her 1-year follow-up.              Conclusion:                    Glucose intolerance and hypokalemia may be rare but serious adverse effects during long-term chemotherapy with capecitabine.",-1
"Infection of Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes with Midgut-Attenuated Sindbis Virus Reduces, but Does Not Eliminate, Disseminated Infection","Arboviruses are transmitted by specific vectors, and the reasons for this specificity are not fully understood. One contributing factor is the existence of tissue barriers within the vector such as the midgut escape barrier. We used microRNA (miRNA) targeting of Sindbis virus (SINV) to study how replication in midgut cells contributes to overcoming this barrier in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. SINV constructs were designed to be attenuated specifically in midgut cells by inserting binding sites for midgut-specific miRNAs into either the 3' untranslated region (MRE3'miRT) or the structural open reading frame (MRE-ORFmiRT) of the SINV genome. Both miRNA-targeted viruses replicated less efficiently than control viruses in the presence of these miRNAs. When mosquitoes were given infectious blood meals containing miRNA-targeted viruses, only around 20% (MRE3'miRT) or 40% (MRE-ORFmiRT) of mosquitoes developed disseminated infection. In contrast, dissemination occurred in almost all mosquitoes fed control viruses. Deep sequencing of virus populations from individual mosquitoes ruled out selection for mutations in the inserted target sequences as the cause for dissemination in these mosquitoes. In mosquitoes that became infected with miRNA-targeted viruses, titers were equivalent to those of mosquitoes infected with control virus in both the midgut and the carcass, and there was no evidence of a threshold titer necessary for dissemination. Instead, it appeared that if infection was successfully established in the midgut, replication and dissemination were largely normal. Our results support the hypothesis that replication is an important factor in allowing SINV to overcome the midgut escape barrier but hint that other factors are also likely involved. IMPORTANCE When a mosquito ingests an arbovirus during a blood meal, the arbovirus must escape from the midgut of the vector and infect the salivary glands in order to be transmitted to a new host. We used tissue-specific miRNA targeting to examine the requirement for Sindbis virus (SINV) to replicate in midgut epithelium in order to cause disseminated infection in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Our results indicate that specifically reducing the ability of SINV to replicate in the mosquito midgut reduces its overall ability to establish infection in the mosquito, but if infection is established, replication and dissemination occur normally. These results are consistent with an importance for replication in the midgut epithelium in aiding arboviruses in crossing the midgut barrier.",-1
Cancer-released exosomal circular RNA circ_0008717 promotes cell tumorigenicity through microRNA-1287-5p/P21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) axis in non-small cell lung cancer,"Circular RNA (circRNA) circ_0008717 has been revealed to promote cell carcinogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Exosomal circRNA packaged into exosomes has been defined as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker of cancers. However, little attention is focused on the role of circRNAs within exosomes in NSCLC. Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation method and qualified by nanoparticle tracking analysis and Western blot. Levels of circ_0008717, microRNA (miR)-1287-5p, and P21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) were detected using qRT-PCR and western blot. The interaction between miR-1287-5p and circ_0008717 or PAK2 was investigated. The phenotypes of NSCLC cells with circ_0008717 downregulation were tested. Circ_0008717 was highly expressed in NSCLC. Functionally, circ_0008717 deficiency suppressed cell malignant phenotypes in NSCLC in vitro and in nude mice. Circ_0008717 sponged miR-1287-5p to elevate PAK2, a downstream target of miR-1287-5p. Silencing of miR-1287-5p blocked the antitumor effects of circ_0008717 knockdown in NSCLC cells. Besides, miR-1287-5p repressed cell oncogenic behaviors in NSCLC by targeting PAK2. Besides that, we confirmed that circ_0008717 was incorporated into exosomes in NSCLC cells. Circ_0008717 knockdown inhibited NSCLC tumorigenesis via miR-1287-5p/PAK2 axis, and the extracellular circulating circ_0008717 was transferred through incorporation in exosomes.",-1
Inflammation and Nitro-oxidative Stress as Drivers of Endocannabinoid System Aberrations in Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is composed of the endocannabinoid ligands anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylgycerol (2-AG), their target cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) and the enzymes involved in their synthesis and metabolism (N-acyltransferase and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the case of AEA and diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) in the case of 2-AG). The origins of ECS dysfunction in major neuropsychiatric disorders remain to be determined, and this paper explores the possibility that they may be associated with chronically increased nitro-oxidative stress and activated immune-inflammatory pathways, and it examines the mechanisms which might be involved. Inflammation and nitro-oxidative stress are associated with both increased CB1 expression, via increased activity of the NADPH oxidases NOX4 and NOX1, and increased CNR1 expression and DNA methylation; and CB2 upregulation via increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, binding of the transcription factor Nrf2 to an antioxidant response element in the CNR2 promoter region and the action of miR-139. CB1 and CB2 have antagonistic effects on redox signalling, which may result from a miRNA-enabled negative feedback loop. The effects of inflammation and oxidative stress are detailed in respect of AEA and 2-AG levels, via effects on calcium homeostasis and phospholipase A2 activity; on FAAH activity, via nitrosylation/nitration of functional cysteine and/or tyrosine residues; and on 2-AG activity via effects on MGLL expression and MAGL. Finally, based on these detailed molecular neurobiological mechanisms, it is suggested that cannabidiol and dimethyl fumarate may have therapeutic potential for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",-1
Parkinson's disease and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background:                    Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection as most of them are at older age. The goal of this study is to update the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 infection in patients with PD.              Methods:                    Two researchers systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and also gray literature including references of the included studies which were published before September 2021. We extracted data regarding the total number of participants, first author, publication year, the country of origin, mean age, number with COVID-19, symptoms, hospitalization, and death.              Results:                    We found 1693 articles by literature search; after deleting duplicates, 798 remained. Thirty articles remained for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 infection in PD cases was 5% (95%CI: 4-6%) (I2 = 98.1%, P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of fever in cases with PD was 4% (95%CI: 2-6%) (I2 = 96%, P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of cough in cases with PD was 3% (95%CI: 2-4%) (I2 = 95.9%, P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of hospitalization in cases with COVID-19 infection was 49% (95%CI: 29-52%) (I2: 93.5%, P < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of mortality in COVID-19 cases was 12% (95%CI: 10-14%) (I2 = 97.6%, P < 0.001).              Conclusion:                    The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis show that the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 infection in PD cases is 5% besides hospitalization and mortality rates which are 49% and 12%.",-1
Gene Therapeutic Approaches for the Treatment of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,"Background:                    Mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified as a pathophysiological hallmark of disease onset and progression in patients with Parkinsonian disorders. Besides the overall emergence of gene therapies in treating these patients, this highly relevant molecular concept has not yet been defined as a target for gene therapeutic approaches.              Methods:                    This narrative review will discuss the experimental evidence suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction as a viable treatment target in patients with monogenic and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In addition, we will focus on general treatment strategies and crucial challenges which need to be overcome.              Results:                    Our current understanding of mitochondrial biology in parkinsonian disorders opens up the avenue for viable treatment strategies in Parkinsonian disorders. Insights can be obtained from primary mitochondrial diseases. However, substantial knowledge gaps and unique challenges of mitochondria-targeted gene therapies need to be addressed to provide innovative treatments in the future.              Conclusions:                    Mitochondria-targeted gene therapies are a potential strategy to improve an important primary disease mechanism in Parkinsonian disorders. However, further studies are needed to address the unique design challenges for mitochondria-targeted gene therapies.",-1
Evaluating the Diagnostic Test Accuracy of Molecular Xenomonitoring Methods for Characterizing Community Burden of Lymphatic Filariasis,"Background:                    Molecular xenomonitoring (MX), the detection of pathogen DNA in mosquitoes, is a recommended approach to support lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination efforts. Potential roles of MX include detecting presence of LF in communities and quantifying progress towards elimination of the disease. However, the relationship between MX results and human prevalence is poorly understood.              Methods:                    We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis from all previously conducted studies that reported the prevalence of filarial DNA in wild-caught mosquitoes (MX rate) and the corresponding prevalence of microfilaria (mf) in humans. We calculated a pooled estimate of MX sensitivity for detecting positive communities at a range of mf prevalence values and mosquito sample sizes. We conducted a linear regression to evaluate the relationship between mf prevalence and MX rate.              Results:                    We identified 24 studies comprising 144 study communities. MX had an overall sensitivity of 98.3% (95% confidence interval, 41.5-99.9%) and identified 28 positive communities that were negative in the mf survey. Low sensitivity in some studies was attributed to small mosquito sample sizes (<1000) and very low mf prevalence (<0.25%). Human mf prevalence and mass drug administration status accounted for approximately half of the variation in MX rate (R2 = 0.49, P < .001). Data from longitudinal studies showed that, within a given study area, there is a strong linear relationship between MX rate and mf prevalence (R2 = 0.78, P < .001).              Conclusions:                    MX shows clear potential as tool for detecting communities where LF is present and as a predictor of human mf prevalence.",-1
Primary Fallopian Tube Carcinoma Presenting with a Massive Inguinal Tumor: A Case Report and Literature Review,"Primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) has characteristics similar to those of ovarian carcinoma. The typical course of PFTC metastasis includes peritoneal dissemination and pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastasis, while inguinal lymph node metastasis is rare. Moreover, the initial presentation of PFTC with an inguinal tumor is extremely rare. A 77-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with a massive 12-cm inguinal subcutaneous tumor. After tumor resection, histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor was a high-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin. Subsequent surgery for total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy revealed that the tumor developed in the fallopian tube. She received adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by maintenance therapy with niraparib. There has been no recurrence or metastasis 9 months after the second surgery. We reviewed the literature for cases of PFTC and ovarian carcinoma that initially presented with an inguinal tumor. In compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed through 31 January 2022 using the PubMed and Google scholar databases and identified 14 cases. In half of them, it was difficult to identify the primary site using preoperative imaging modalities. Disease recurrence occurred in two cases; thus, the prognosis of this type of PFTC appears to be good.",-1
Pharmacokinetics and Bioequivalence of 2 Immediate-Release Tofacitinib Tablet Formulations in Chinese Healthy Volunteers Under Fasting and Fed Conditions,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence of a generic immediate-release tofacitinib tablet versus a brand-named immediate-release tofacitinib tablet under fasting and fed conditions, and the food effect on pharmacokinetic profiles of the both formulations. This randomized, open-label, 2-period, crossover, bioequivalence study included 52 healthy Chinese subjects (fasting cohort: n = 26; fed cohort: n = 26). The subjects were assigned to receive a single 5-mg dose of generic or brand-named tofacitinib. Blood samples were collected at predosing and up to 14 hours after dosing. Tofacitinib concentrations in plasma were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Safety was monitored. There were no significant differences in maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0-t ), AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC0-â?), and terminal elimination half-life between the test and reference formulations (all P > .05); high-fat food had no significant effect on AUC0-t , AUC0-â? or terminal elimination half-life of immediate-release tofacitinib tablets (all P > .05). The 90% confidence intervals of the test/reference ratios of log-transformed maximum plasma concentration, AUC0-t , and AUC0-â?were within the range of 80% to 125% under both fasting and fed conditions. No serious adverse events were reported. The 2 formulations of immediate-release tofacitinib tablets are bioequivalent and well tolerated under both fasting and fed conditions in healthy Chinese volunteers. Food had no clinically relevant effects on drug exposure of tofacitinib.",-1
"Downregulation of hepatic fat accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by nerolidol in purpose built western-diet-induced multiple-hit pathogenesis of NASH animal model","Western diet style (fast food), which includes fatty frozen junk food, lard, processed meats, whole-fat dairy foods, cream, mayonnaise, butter, snacks, and fructose, is a primary etiological determinant for developing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) worldwide. Here the primary focus is to see the impact of naturally identified essential oil on disease mechanisms developed in an animal model using the same ingredients. Currently, symptomatic therapies are recommended for the management of NASH due to non-availability of specific treatments. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the potential anti-NASH effect of nerolidol in a rat model fed with a purpose-built diet. The diet substantially induced insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and elevation of liver enzymes in the experimental animals. The levels of liver oxidative stress markers, nitrites (NO2-), serum pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-Î±) and hepatic collagen were increased in disease control rats. Nerolidol oral treatment in ascending dose order of 250 and 500 mg/kg substantially reduced the steatosis (macrovesicular and microvesicular), degeneration of hepatocytes, and inflammatory cells infiltration. The amounts of circulatory TNF-Î± and tissue collagen were also reduced at 500 mg/kg dose of nerolidol, expressing its anti-fibrotic effect. The current study described the multiple-hit pathophysiology of NASH as enhanced steatosis, pro-inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress in rats, which resulted in the development of vicious insulin resistance. Nerolidol treatment significantly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and halted disease progression induced by a hypercaloric diet.",-1
Needles in Haystacks: Understanding the Success of Selective Pairing of Nucleic Acids,"The effectiveness of several biological and biotechnological processes relies on the remarkably selective pairing of nucleic acids in contexts of molecular complexity. Relevant examples are the on-target binding of primers in genomic PCR and the regulatory efficacy of microRNA via binding on the transcriptome. Here, we propose a statistical framework that enables us to describe and understand such selectivity by means of a model that is extremely cheap from a computational point of view. By re-parametrizing the hybridization thermodynamics on three classes of base pairing errors, we find a convenient way to obtain the free energy of pairwise interactions between nucleic acids. We thus evaluate the hybridization statistics of a given oligonucleotide within a large number of competitive sites that we assume to be random, and we compute the probability of on-target binding. We apply our strategy to PCR amplification and microRNA-based gene regulation, shedding new light on their selectivity. In particular, we show the relevance of the defectless pairing of 3' terminals imposed by the polymerase in PCR selection. We also evaluate the selectivity afforded by the microRNA seed region, thus quantifying the extra contributions given by mechanisms beyond pairing statistics.",-1
Increased biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in HIV-1 viremic controllers and low persistent inflammation in elite controllers and art-suppressed individuals,"HIV controllers (HICs) are models of HIV functional cure, although some studies have shown persistent inflammation and increased rates of atherosclerosis in HICs. Since immune activation/inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), we evaluated clinical data and inflammation markers in HIV-1 viremic controllers (VC), elite controllers (EC), and control groups (HIV positive individuals with virological suppression by antiretroviral therapy-cART; HIV negative individuals-HIVneg) to assess whether they presented elevated levels of inflammation markers also associated with CVD. We observed the highest frequencies of activated CD8+ T cells in VCs, while EC and cART groups presented similar but slightly altered frequencies of this marker when compared to the HIVneg group. Regarding platelet activation, both HICs groups presented higher expression of P-selectin in platelets when compared to control groups. Monocyte subset analyses revealed lower frequencies of classical monocytes and increased frequencies of non-classical and intermediate monocytes among cART individuals and in EC when compared to HIV negative individuals, but none of the differences were significant. For VC, however, significant decreases in frequencies of classical monocytes and increases in the frequency of intermediate monocytes were observed in comparison to HIV negative individuals. The frequency of monocytes expressing tissue factor was similar among the groups on all subsets. In terms of plasma markers, VC had higher levels of many inflammatory markers, while EC had higher levels of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 compared to control groups. Our data showed that VCs display increased levels of inflammation markers that have been associated with CVD risk. Meanwhile, ECs show signals of lower but persistent inflammation, comparable to the cART group, indicating the potential benefits of alternative therapies to decrease inflammation in this group.",-1
Effects of Parkinson Disease on Blur-Driven and Disparity-Driven Vergence Eye Movements,"Synchronous movements of the 2 eyes in the opposite direction, disconjugate movements such as vergence, facilitate depth perception. The vergence eye movements are affected in Parkinson disease (PD). Visual blur (accommodation) and fusion (retinal disparity) are important triggers for the vergence. The neural circuit responsible for blur-driven and disparity-driven vergence is tightly coupled. We investigated the effect of PD on these 2 vergence paradigms. In the experiment involving 14 patients with PD and 6 healthy controls, substantial differences between blur-driven and disparity-driven vergence were found. The gain (ratio of actual vs desired eye movements) was reduced in patients with PD in case of disparity-driven vergence but not in blur-driven vergence. The latency of disparity-driven vergence onset was significantly longer for patients with PD compared with healthy controls. Four strategies were used to drive disparity-driven vergence: a) pure disconjugate vergence, b) conjugate saccadic movements, c) disconjugate vergence followed by saccadic movements, and d) conjugate saccades followed by disconjugate vergence movements. Blur-driven vergence had only 2 strategies: a) conjugate saccades followed by disconjugate vergence and b) conjugate saccadic movements only. The results are consistent with the prediction that PD primarily affects disparity-driven vergence, but there are some effects on the strategies to execute blur-driven vergence. We speculate that the deep cerebellar nuclei and the supraoculomotor area of the midbrain that carry the disparity-driven and blur-driven vergence are affected in PD. It is possible to modulate their function through projections to the subthalamic nuclei.",-1
Heat-Treated Adzuki Bean Protein Hydrolysates Reduce Obesity in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet via Remodeling Gut Microbiota and Improving Metabolic Function,"Scope:                    Heat-treated adzuki bean protein hydrolysates (APH) reduce cholesterol in vitro. However, it is unclear if APH have anti-obesity effects in vivo and, if so, the relationship between the effects and the improvement of gut microbiota composition and metabolic function.              Methods and results:                    Four groups of mice are fed either a normal control diet (NCD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without APH for 12 weeks. In HFD-fed mice, APH supplementation significantly alleviate fat accumulation, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation. In addition, APH supplementation regulate gut microbiota composition, reduce the abundance of harmful bacteria (Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Romboutsia, Blautia, Mucispirillum, Bilophila, and Peptococcus), enrich Lactobacillus and SCFA-producing bacteria (Lactobacillaceae, Eisenbergiella, Alistipes, Parabacteroides, Tannerellaceae, Eubacterium_nodatum_group, Acetatifactor, Rikenellaceae, and Odoribacter), and increase fecal SCFAs concentration. Importantly, APH supplementation significantly regulate the levels of serum metabolites, especially Lactobacillus-derived metabolites and tryptophan derivatives, which help to alleviate obesity and its complications.              Conclusion:                    APH improve gut microbiota composition and metabolic function in mice and may help to prevent and treat obesity and related complications.",-1
MiR-494-3p Upregulation Exacerbates Cerebral Ischemia Injury by Targeting Bhlhe40,"Purpose:                    Cerebral ischemia is related to insufficient blood supply and is characterized by abnormal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell apoptosis. Previous studies have revealed a key role for basic helix-loop-helix family member e40 (Bhlhe40) in oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the roles of miR-494-3p in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.              Materials and methods:                    A mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO/R) model was established to mimic cerebral ischemia in vivo. Brain infarct area was assessed using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) operation was adopted to mimic neuronal injury in vitro. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The relationship between miR-494-3p and Bhlhe40 was validated by luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays.              Results:                    Bhlhe40 expression was downregulated both in MCAO/R animal models and OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Bhlhe40 overexpression inhibited cell apoptosis and reduced ROS production in SH-SY5Y cells after OGD/R treatment. MiR-494-3p was verified to bind to Bhlhe40 and negatively regulate Bhlhe40 expression. Additionally, cell apoptosis and ROS production in OGD/R-treated SH-SY5Y cells were accelerated by miR-494-3p overexpression. Rescue experiments suggested that Bhlhe40 could reverse the effects of miR-494-3p overexpression on ROS production and cell apoptosis.              Conclusion:                    MiR-494-3p exacerbates brain injury and neuronal injury by regulating Bhlhe40 after I/R.",-1
Species-targeted sorting and cultivation of commensal bacteria from the gut microbiome using flow cytometry under anaerobic conditions,"Background:                    There is a growing interest in using gut commensal bacteria as ""next generation"" probiotics. However, this approach is still hampered by the fact that there are few or no strains available for specific species that are difficult to cultivate. Our objective was to adapt flow cytometry and cell sorting to be able to detect, separate, isolate, and cultivate new strains of commensal species from fecal material. We focused on the extremely oxygen sensitive (EOS) species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the under-represented, health-associated keystone species Christensenella minuta as proof-of-concept.              Results:                    A BD InfluxÂ® cell sorter was equipped with a glovebox that covered the sorting area. This box was flushed with nitrogen to deplete oxygen in the enclosure. Anaerobic conditions were maintained during the whole process, resulting in only minor viability loss during sorting and culture of unstained F. prausnitzii strains ATCC 27766, ATCC 27768, and DSM 17677. We then generated polyclonal antibodies against target species by immunizing rabbits with heat-inactivated bacteria. Two polyclonal antibodies were directed against F. prausnitzii type strains that belong to different phylogroups, whereas one was directed against C. minuta strain DSM 22607. The specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by sorting and sequencing the stained bacterial fractions from fecal material. In addition, staining solutions including LIVE/DEADâ?BacLightâ?Bacterial Viability staining and polyclonal antibodies did not severely impact bacterial viability while allowing discrimination between groups of strains. Finally, we combined these staining strategies as well as additional criteria based on bacterial shape for C. minuta and were able to detect, isolate, and cultivate new F. prausnitzii and C. minuta strains from healthy volunteer's fecal samples.              Conclusions:                    Targeted cell-sorting under anaerobic conditions is a promising tool for the study of fecal microbiota. It gives the opportunity to quickly analyze microbial populations, and can be used to sort EOS and/or under-represented strains of interest using specific antibodies, thus opening new avenues for culture experiments.

EarLy Surveillance for Autoimmune diabetes: protocol for a qualitative study of general population and stakeholder perspectives on screening for type 1 diabetes in the UK (ELSA 1),"Objective:                    Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common form of diabetes in children, accounting for 96% of cases, with 29 000 children affected in the UK. Studies have recently identified immunotherapies that safely delay the development of T1D for at least 3 years, and further therapies are in development. General population screening programs in other countries can now accurately identify children with presymptomatic T1D who can be entered into prevention studies. The UK does not have such a system in place. We aim to explore whether parents and children in the UK would want to be part of such a program of testing for T1D in the general population, how they would want to be informed and participate in such a program, and how any barriers to recruitment and participation can be addressed. Additionally, the views of stakeholders who would be involved in the testing program will be collected and analyzed.              Research design and methods:                    We will interview parents/guardians and children aged 3-13 years about their views on screening for T1D. We will recruit purposefully to ensure representation across ethnicities and socioeconomic groups. Interviews will be transcribed, analyzed and used to inform iterative co-design work with additional families to address any issues raised. Similar qualitative work will be undertaken with professional stakeholders who would be involved in implementing any future screening program. Where possible, all aspects of this study will be performed remotely by phone or online to minimize infection risk.              Conclusions:                    This qualitative study will provide the first insights into acceptability of testing and monitoring for T1D in the general population from the perspective of families and stakeholders in the UK. Co-design work will help establish the barriers and identify strategies to mitigate and overcome these issues, as an important step towards consideration of national testing for T1D.",-1
MicroRNA let-7i inhibits granulosa-luteal cell proliferation and oestradiol biosynthesis by directly targeting IMP2,"Research question:                    Increased granulosa cell division is associated with abnormal folliculogenesis in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Lethal-7i microRNA (let-7i) may play an important role in the follicular development and granulosa cell growth; therefore is let-7i involved in PCOS pathogenesis?              Design:                    The expression of let-7i was measured in granulosa-luteal cells (GLC) from women with or without PCOS. A human granulosa cell line, KGN, was used for the functional study. Mimics and inhibitors of let-7i, lentiviruses expressing insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein (IMP2), and small-interfering RNAs were transfected into KGN cells. KGN cell proliferation was determined by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. The cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by propidium iodide-annexin V (PI-A) staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Oestradiol concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay were applied to confirm the let-7i target genes.              Results:                    The study showed that let-7i was down-regulated in PCOS GLC (P = 0.001). Mimics of let-7i inhibited KGN proliferation (P = 0.001), and decreased aromatase expression (P = 0.030) and oestradiol production (P = 0.029), whereas let-7i inhibitors had the opposite effect. Bioinformatics analysis and quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR identified IMP2 as a target of let-7i (P = 0.021). qRT-PCR and western blot analysis indicated that IMP2 was up-regulated in GLC in women with PCOS (P = 0.001 and P = 0.044), and IMP2 expression was suppressed by let-7i in KGN cells (P < 0.001). Luciferase reporter assay results (P = 0.002), combined with the rescue assay, confirmed that let-7i inhibited KGN cell proliferation and reduced oestradiol concentration by directly targeting IMP2.              Conclusions:                    let-7i was down-regulated in PCOS GLC. Overexpression of let-7i inhibited KGN cell proliferation and decreased oestradiol production in an IMP2-dependent manner, providing a new molecular mechanism for PCOS.",-1
Visceral adipogenesis inhibited by Pref-1 is associated with peritoneal angiogenesis,"Aim:                    Studies showed an increased visceral adipose tissue and peritoneal angiogenesis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, the relationship between the visceral adipose expands and peritoneal angiogenesis remains unclear.              Methods:                    Pref-1 (preadipocyte factor-1) recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) and control AAV were constructed. Mice were divided into four groups, mice in control and PD group were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, mice in control-AAV-PD were injected intraperitoneally with plaque-forming unit (PFU) control AAV and mice in pref-1-AAV-PD group were injected with PFU recombinant AAV. Two weeks later, control group was injected intraperitoneally with normal saline while other groups were injected intraperitoneally with 4.25% peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF). Thirty days later, viscerall adipose tissue was collected and weighed. Pref-1 protein expression was measured by Western blot, and peritoneal permeability was measured by Evans blue. Cluster of differentiation 31(CD31) immunohistochemical staining was used to detect mesenteric blood vessel number, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.              Results:                    Pref-1 protein expression increased in pref-1-AAV-PD group. Visceral adipose expanded in PD and control-AAV-PD group while decreased in pref-1-AAV-PD group, which approves PD fluid enhance visceral adipogensis, and the process could be inhibited by Pref-1 recombinant AAV. The reduction of peritoneal vessel number and the decrease of vascular permeability as well as down-regulation of serum vascular endothelial growth factor observed in pref-1-AAV-PD group suggested peritoneal angiogenesis could be inhibited following visceral adipose tissue reduction.              Conclusion:                    Visceral adipose expands is associated with peritoneal angiogenesis in PD treatment, and prevention of visceral adipogenesis may be an alternative way to protect the validity of peritoneum.

VZV Infection of Primary Human Adrenal Cortical Cells Produces a Proinflammatory Environment without Cell Death,"Virus infection of adrenal glands can disrupt secretion of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and sex hormones from the cortex and catecholamines from the medulla, leading to a constellation of symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, weight loss, nausea, and muscle and joint pain. Specifically, varicella zoster virus (VZV) can produce bilateral adrenal hemorrhage and adrenal insufficiency during primary infection or following reactivation. However, the mechanisms by which VZV affects the adrenal glands are not well-characterized. Herein, we determined if primary human adrenal cortical cells (HAdCCs) infected with VZV support viral replication and produce a proinflammatory environment. Quantitative PCR showed VZV DNA increasing over time in HAdCCs, yet no cell death was seen at 3 days post-infection by TUNEL staining or Western Blot analysis with PARP and caspase 9 antibodies. Compared to conditioned supernatant from mock-infected cells, supernatant from VZV-infected cells contained significantly elevated IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-4, and TNF-Î±. Overall, VZV can productively infect adrenal cortical cells in the absence of cell death, suggesting that these cells may be a potential reservoir for ongoing viral replication and proinflammatory cytokine production, leading to chronic adrenalitis and dysfunction.",-1
KLF4 Affects Acute Renal Allograft Injury via Binding to MicroRNA-155-5p Promoter to Regulate ERRFI1,"Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) owns the promising potential in treating kidney injury, which inevitably occurs during renal allograft. Given that, this research targets to unveil KLF4-oriented mechanism from microRNA-155-5p/ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (miR-155-5p/ERRFI1) axis in acute renal allograft injury. Mice were injected with miR-155-5p-related sequences before acute renal allograft modeling. Afterwards, serum inflammation, along with oxidative stress, renal tubular injury, and apoptosis in renal tissues were detected. HK-2 cells were processed by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and transfected with miR-155-5p- or ERRFI1-related sequences, after which cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured. KLF4, miR-155-5p, and ERRFI1 expressions and their interaction were tested. KLF4 and miR-155-5p levels were enhanced, and ERRFI1 level was repressed in mice after acute renal allograft and in H/R-treated HK-2 cells. KLF4 bound to the promoter of miR-155-5p. Depleting miR-155-5p reduced serum inflammation and attenuated oxidative stress, renal tubular injury, and apoptosis in mice with acute renal allograft injury. Downregulating miR-155-5p facilitated proliferation and repressed apoptosis of H/R-treated HK-2 cells. miR-155-5p targeted ERRFI1. Knocking down ERRFI1 antagonized the effects of downregulated miR-155-5p on acute renal allograft injury, as well as on H/R-treated HK-2 cell proliferation and apoptosis. A summary displays that silencing KLF4 suppresses miR-155-5p to attenuate acute renal allograft injury by upregulating ERRFI1, which provides a way to control acute renal allograft injury.",-1
DeepTESR: A Deep Learning Framework to Predict the Degree of Translational Elongation Short Ramp for Gene Expression Control,"Controlling translational elongation is essential for efficient protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling has revealed that the speed of ribosome movement is correlated with translational efficiency in the translational elongation ramp. In this work, we present a new deep learning model, called DeepTESR, to predict the degree of translational elongation short ramp (TESR) from mRNA sequence. The proposed deep learning model exhibited superior performance in predicting the TESR scores for 226 981 TESR sequences, resulting in the mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.285 and a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.627, superior to the conventional machine learning models (e.g., MAE of 0.335 and R2 of 0.571 for LightGBM). We experimentally validated that heterologous fluorescence expression of proteins with randomly selected TESR was moderately correlated with the predictions. Furthermore, a genome-wide analysis of TESR prediction in the 4305 coding sequences of Escherichia coli showed conserved TESRs over the clusters of orthologous groups. In this sense, DeepTESR can be used to predict the degree of TESR for gene expression control and to decipher the mechanism of translational control with ribosome profiling. DeepTESR is available at https://github.com/fmblab/DeepTESR.",-1
deepHPI: a comprehensive deep learning platform for accurate prediction and visualization of host-pathogen protein-protein interactions,"Host-pathogen protein interactions (HPPIs) play vital roles in many biological processes and are directly involved in infectious diseases. With the outbreak of more frequent pandemics in the last couple of decades, such as the recent outburst of Covid-19 causing millions of deaths, it has become more critical to develop advanced methods to accurately predict pathogen interactions with their respective hosts. During the last decade, experimental methods to identify HPIs have been used to decipher host-pathogen systems with the caveat that those techniques are labor-intensive, expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, accurate prediction of HPIs can be performed by the use of data-driven machine learning. To provide a more robust and accurate solution for the HPI prediction problem, we have developed a deepHPI tool based on deep learning. The web server delivers four host-pathogen model types: plant-pathogen, human-bacteria, human-virus and animal-pathogen, leveraging its operability to a wide range of analyses and cases of use. The deepHPI web tool is the first to use convolutional neural network models for HPI prediction. These models have been selected based on a comprehensive evaluation of protein features and neural network architectures. The best prediction models have been tested on independent validation datasets, which achieved an overall Matthews correlation coefficient value of 0.87 for animal-pathogen using the combined pseudo-amino acid composition and conjoint triad (PAAC_CT) features, 0.75 for human-bacteria using the combined pseudo-amino acid composition, conjoint triad and normalized Moreau-Broto feature (PAAC_CT_NMBroto), 0.96 for human-virus using PAAC_CT_NMBroto and 0.94 values for plant-pathogen interactions using the combined pseudo-amino acid composition, composition and transition feature (PAAC_CTDC_CTDT). Our server running deepHPI is deployed on a high-performance computing cluster that enables large and multiple user requests, and it provides more information about interactions discovered. It presents an enriched visualization of the resulting host-pathogen networks that is augmented with external links to various protein annotation resources. We believe that the deepHPI web server will be very useful to researchers, particularly those working on infectious diseases. Additionally, many novel and known host-pathogen systems can be further investigated to significantly advance our understanding of complex disease-causing agents. The developed models are established on a web server, which is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.usu.edu/deepHPI/.",-1
"Aedes larval bionomics and implications for dengue control in the paradigmatic Jaffna peninsula, northern Sri Lanka","Background:                    The larval bionomics of Aedes across the Jaffna peninsula in northern Sri Lanka was investigated to obtain information needed for developing more effective larval source reduction measures to control endemic arboviral diseases.              Methods:                    The habitats of preimaginal stages of Aedes mosquitoes were surveyed, and ovitrap collections were carried out in densely populated areas of the Jaffna peninsula. Aedes larval productivities were analysed against habitat characteristics, rainfall and dengue incidence. Adults emerging from collected larvae were tested for dengue virus (DENV).              Results:                    Only Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus and Ae. vittatus were identified in the field habitat collections and ovitraps. Aedes aegypti was the predominant species in both the field habitat and ovitrap collections, followed by Ae. albopictus and small numbers of Ae. vittatus. Tires and open drains were the preferred field habitats for Ae. aegypti, although larval productivity was higher in discarded plastic containers. The three Aedes species differed in field habitat preferences. Concomitant presence of the three Aedes species was observed in the field habitats and ovitraps. Larval productivities were inversely correlated with the salinity of the field habitat. Rainfall in the preceding month significantly correlated with larval productivity in the field habitats. DENV serotype 2 was detected in Ae. aegypti collected from ovitraps in the city of Jaffna. High Breteau, House and Container indices of 5.1, 5.1 and 7.9%, respectively, were observed in the field habitat surveys and ovitrap indices of up to 92% were found in Jaffna city.              Conclusions:                    Aedes larval indices in populated areas of the peninsula showed a high potential for dengue epidemics. Unacceptable littering practices, failure to implement existing dengue control guidelines, vertical transmission of DENV in vector mosquitoes and preimaginal development in brackish water and open surface drains, as well as in domestic wells that provide potable water, are serious constraints to the current Aedes larval source reduction methods used to control dengue in the Jaffna peninsula. Similar shortcomings in arboviral disease control are likely present in other resource-constrained tropical coastal zones worldwide.",-1
"Association of Appendicular Lean Mass, and Subcutaneous and Visceral Adipose Tissue With Mortality in Older Brazilians: The SÃ£o Paulo Ageing & Health Study","Body composition changes as a result of ageing may impact the survival of older adults. However, its influence on mortality risk is uncertain. Currently, the best method for body composition analysis in clinical practice is DXA. Nonetheless, the few studies on body composition by DXA and mortality risk in the elderly have some limitations. We investigated the association between body composition by DXA and mortality in a cohort of elderly subjects. Eight hundred thirty-nine community-dwelling subjects (516 women, 323 men) â?65 years of age were assessed by a questionnaire, clinical data, laboratory exams, and body composition by DXA at baseline. Total fat and its components (eg, visceral adipose tissue [VAT]) were estimated. Appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted for fat and ALM divided by heightÂ² was used to ascertain the presence of low muscle mass (LMM). Mortality was recorded during follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compute ORs for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Over a mean follow-up of 4.06 Â± 1.07 years, there were 132 (15.7%) deaths. In men, after adjustment for relevant variables, the presence of LMM (OR, 11.36, 95% CI, 2.21 to 58.37, P = 0.004) and VAT (OR, 1.99, 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.87, P < 0.001, for each 100-g increase) significantly increased all-cause mortality risk, whereas total fat, measured by the fat mass index, was associated with decreased mortality risk (OR, 0.48, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.71, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for cardiovascular mortality. In women, only LMM was a predictor of all-cause (OR, 62.88, 95% CI, 22.59 to 175.0, P < 0.001) and cardiovascular death (OR, 74.54, 95% CI, 9.72 to 571.46, P < 0.001). LMM ascertained by ALM adjusted for fat and fat mass by itself are associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk in the elderly. Visceral and subcutaneous fat have opposite roles on mortality risk in elderly men. Thus, DXA is a promising tool to estimate risk of mortality in the elderly.

Visceral adipose tissue volume and CT-attenuation as prognostic factors in patients with head and neck cancer,"Background:                    The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of the characteristics of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) to the disease progression-free survival and distant failure-free survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).              Methods:                    We enrolled 152 HNSCC patients who underwent staging 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT). Maximum FDG uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV]) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the primary tumor and volume, CT-attenuation (Hounsfield units [HU]), and FDG uptake of SAT and VAT were measured. Survival analysis using Cox proportional hazard modeling was performed to assess the relationship between the adipose tissue parameters of PET/CT and survival.              Results:                    Patients with low VAT volume and high VAT HU had significantly worse progression-free survival and distant failure-free survival than those with high VAT volume and low VAT HU. On multivariate analysis, the volume and HU of VAT were significantly correlated with disease progression-free survival and distant failure-free survival after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, TNM stage, serum C-reactive protein, maximum SUV, and TLG.              Conclusion:                    The volume and CT-attenuation of VAT were significantly correlated with disease progression-free survival and distant failure-free survival in patients with HNSCC.",-1
Direct Effects of Glyphosate on In Vitro T Helper Cell Differentiation and Cytokine Production,"Glyphosate (G) is the active ingredient of the most used herbicides worldwide. Its use is currently very debated, as several studies indicating its hazard and toxicity are emerging. Among them, there is evidence of adverse effects on the immune system. The aim of this work was to investigate if G could directly affect immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy donors were used as experimental model. PBMC were expose to G and stimulated with PMA/ionomycin, T helper (Th) cell differentiation and cytokine production were assessed by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. A reduction of Th1/Th2 ratio, mainly due to a decrease in Th1 cells, was observed following G exposure. Results show an enhancement of IL-4 and IL-17A production, and a reduction of IFN-Î³. Based on literature evidence that suggest G being an endocrine disruptor, we investigated the role of nuclear estrogen receptors (ER). ERÎ±/ERÎ² inhibition by ICI 182,780 abolished the effects of G on IFN-Î³ and IL-4 release, suggesting a role of ER in the observed effects. To further characterize the mechanism of action of G, miRNAs, both in exosome and intracellular, were investigated. A statistically significant increase in miR-500a-5p was observed following G treatment. The blockage of miR-500a-5p, using a specific antagomir, prevented G-induced reduction of IFN-Î³ production. Finally a relationship between miR-500a-5p up-regulation and ER was observed. Overall, these results suggest that G can directly act on T cells, altering T cell differentiation and cytokines production.",-1
Inflammation in Cerebral Venous Thrombosis,"Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare form of cerebrovascular disease that impairs people's wellbeing and quality of life. Inflammation is considered to play an important role in CVT initiation and progression. Several studies have reported the important role of leukocytes, proinflammatory cytokines, and adherence molecules in the CVT-related inflammatory process. Moreover, inflammatory factors exacerbate CVT-induced brain tissue injury leading to poor prognosis. Based on clinical observations, emerging evidence shows that peripheral blood inflammatory biomarkers-especially neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte count-are correlated with CVT [mean difference (MD) (95%CI), 0.74 (0.11, 1.38), p = 0.02 and -0.29 (-0.51, -0.06), p = 0.01, respectively]. Moreover, increased NLR and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) portend poor patient outcomes. Evidence accumulated since the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) indicates that COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccine can induce CVT through inflammatory reactions. Given the poor understanding of the association between inflammation and CVT, many conundrums remain unsolved. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the exact relationship between inflammation and CVT in the future.",-1
Neuroprotective effects of liraglutide against inflammation through the AMPK/NF-ÎºB pathway in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with increasing incidence in aged populations, second only to Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence has shown that inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease. Growing evidence has shown that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NF-ÎºB are closely related to inflammation. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is primarily secreted by intestinal endocrine L cells, and it has a variety of physiology through binding to GLP-1 receptor. GLP-1can be used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. In addition, GLP-1 also has anti-neuroinflammation activity. However, the exact mechanism behind how GLP-1 regulates neuroinflammation remains unclear. This study was designed to examine the effect of liraglutide on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced injury in mice and its potential mechanism of action. Results showed that liraglutide dose-dependently ameliorated mouse behavior including swimming time and locomotor activity, increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and protein level, and reduced Iba1 and GFAP expression in the substantia nigra (SN). Liraglutide treatment also increased p-AMPK expression and reduced NF-ÎºB protein level. Applying the AMPK inhibitor Dorsomorphin (Compound C) reversed the effect of liraglutide-reducing p-AMPK and increasing NF-ÎºB expression. Finally, GFAP protein level increased, along with a decrease in TH expression. In conclusion, these results suggest that liraglutide can suppress neuroinflammation. Moreover, this effect is mediated through the AMPK/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway.",-1
Does the gut microbiota contribute to the antiobesity effect of exercise? A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objective:                    The aim of this study was to assess gut microbiota modifications after exercise in humans and animal models with obesity or type 2 diabetes and their role in exercise-induced weight loss.              Methods:                    A systematic search of six databases was conducted on July 31, 2021. The extracted data on body fat or body weight from human and animal studies were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis.              Results:                    A total of 28 studies were included, with all studies reporting exercise-induced gut microbiota modifications; however, the modified taxa varied among studies. Proteobacteria was the only taxa reported to be altered by exercise in more than one human and one animal study. Taxa belonging to Firmicutes were the most responsive to exercise in humans and mice, whereas Proteobacteria taxa were the most responsive to exercise in rats. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the weight-lowering effect of exercise based on data subgrouped by altered or unaltered Î±-diversity or Î²-diversity. The association between the weight-lowering effect of exercise and altered Î²-diversity was observed in humans with obesity but not in animals.              Conclusions:                    These findings suggest that gut microbiota modifications contribute to exercise-induced weight loss in obesity; however, their precise contributions, especially those of taxon-level variations, remain to be investigated.",-1
Semi-supervised medical image segmentation via a tripled-uncertainty guided mean teacher model with contrastive learning,"Due to the difficulty in accessing a large amount of labeled data, semi-supervised learning is becoming an attractive solution in medical image segmentation. To make use of unlabeled data, current popular semi-supervised methods (e.g., temporal ensembling, mean teacher) mainly impose data-level and model-level consistency on unlabeled data. In this paper, we argue that in addition to these strategies, we could further utilize auxiliary tasks and consider task-level consistency to better excavate effective representations from unlabeled data for segmentation. Specifically, we introduce two auxiliary tasks, i.e., a foreground and background reconstruction task for capturing semantic information and a signed distance field (SDF) prediction task for imposing shape constraint, and explore the mutual promotion effect between the two auxiliary and the segmentation tasks based on mean teacher architecture. Moreover, to handle the potential bias of the teacher model caused by annotation scarcity, we develop a tripled-uncertainty guided framework to encourage the three tasks in the student model to learn more reliable knowledge from the teacher. When calculating uncertainty, we propose an uncertainty weighted integration (UWI) strategy for yielding the segmentation predictions of the teacher. In addition, following the advance of unsupervised learning in leveraging the unlabeled data, we also incorporate a contrastive learning based constraint to help the encoders extract more distinct representations to promote the medical image segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on the public 2017 ACDC dataset and the PROMISE12 dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.",-1
Preventive effects of polysaccharides from Physalis alkekengi L. on dietary advanced glycation end product-induced insulin resistance in mice associated with the modulation of gut microbiota,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are commonly found in thermally processed foods, and long-term high AGE feeding has been reported to have negative effects on body health. In the current study, the effect of Physalis alkekengi L. fruit polysaccharide (PFP) on preventing dietary AGE-induced insulin resistance (IR) in mice was investigated. The results showed that PFP administration can significantly ameliorate hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance induced by dietary AGEs in mice. Compared to AGE-treated mice, the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IS) index of PFP-treated mice were improved significantly (p < 0.05). The levels of endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines in the liver decreased, while the levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 and insulin receptor substrate-2 in the liver increased (p < 0.05). The 16S rRNA analysis showed that PFP administration reversed the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and reduced lipopolysaccharide generation and inflammation-related bacteria, including Desulfovibrio and Acetatifactor. In addition, PFP administration also increased short-chain fatty acid levels in feces compared to dietary AGE-treated mice. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that certain specific genera, including Alistipes and Caproiciproducens, are closely related to IR-related parameters. These findings suggest that PFP can prevent dietary AGE-induced IR by modulating the gut microbiota and increasing microbial metabolites.",-1
Chronic Consumption of Cocoa Rich in Procyanidins Has a Marginal Impact on Gut Microbiota and on Serum and Fecal Metabolomes in Male Endurance Athletes,"Cocoa is used in the sports world as a supplement, although there is no consensus on its use. We investigated the effect of cocoa intake on intestinal ischemia (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP)), serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, gastrointestinal symptoms, and gut microbiota in endurance athletes during their training period on an unrestricted diet. We also performed a metabolomics analysis of serum and feces after a bout of exercise before and after supplementation. Cocoa consumption had no effect on I-FABP, LPS, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Cocoa intake significantly increased the abundance of Blautia and Lachnospira genera and decreased the abundance of the Agathobacter genus, which was accompanied by elevated levels of polyphenol fecal metabolites 4-hydroxy-5-(phenyl)-valeric acid and O-methyl-epicatechin-O-glucuronide. Our untargeted approach revealed that cocoa had no significant effects on serum and fecal metabolites and that its consumption had little impact on the metabolome after a bout of physical exercise.",-1
A Murine Commensal Protozoan Influences Host Glucose Homeostasis by Facilitating Free Choline Generation,"Recent progress indicates that the gut microbiota plays important role in regulating the host's glucose homeostasis. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we reported that one integral member of the murine gut microbiota, the protozoan Tritrichomonas musculis could drive the host's glucose metabolic imbalance. Using metabolomics analysis and in vivo assays, we found that mechanistically this protozoan influences the host glucose metabolism by facilitating the production of a significant amount of free choline. Free choline could be converted sequentially by choline-utilizing bacteria and then the host to a final product trimethylamine N-oxide, which promoted hepatic gluconeogenesis. Together, our data reveal a previously underappreciated gut eukaryotic microorganism by working together with other members of microbiota to influence the host's metabolism. Our study underscores the importance and prevalence of metabolic interactions between the gut microbiota and the host in modulating the host's metabolic health. IMPORTANCE Blood glucose levels are important for human health and can be influenced by gut microbes. However, its mechanism of action was previously unknown. In this study, researchers identify a unique member of the gut microbes in mice that can influence glucose metabolism by promoting the host's ability to synthesis glucose by using nonglucose materials. This is because of its ability to generate the essential nutrient choline, and choline, aided by other gut bacteria and the host, is converted to trimethylamine N-oxide, which promotes glucose production. These studies show how gut microbes promote metabolic dysfunction and suggest novel approaches for treating patients with blood glucose abnormality.",-1
Can fetal abdominal visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous fat thickness be used for correct estimation of fetal weight? A preliminary study,"The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new formula for the calculation of an estimated fetal weight (EFW) and to evaluate value of fetal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and abdominal subcutaneous fat (SF) thickness on the prediction of birth weight. In this prospective study, fetal biometry, EFW, fetal VAT and SF thickness were measured in low-risk 37-41 gestational weeks pregnant women by ultrasonography. The linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between birth weight and obstetric measurements. It was found that the most important factors in the prediction of a birth weight were the abdominal circumference (AC), SF and VAT. The new formula for EFW was EFW=-2748.622+13.811*AC+56.795*SF+17.913*VAT According to the Hadlock 3 and the new formula, 92% and 95% of all fetal weight estimations were within 10% of actual birth weight, respectively. Measurement of VAT and SF thickness in prediction of fetal weight could reduce a weight estimation error. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? An accurate prediction of fetal weight during gestation provides useful information for assessing the fetal and newborn health status. As the detection of growth abnormalities is vital, there is a need for a reliable method of assessing birth weight during labour. Unfortunately, although different methods are available, a simple, quick and reliable method of assessing birth weight is still in debate. Fetal visceral adipose (VAT) tissue measurement is a new method which could be used for the correct estimation of fetal weight. Like adults, the VAT and subcutaneous fat tissue (SF) thickness could be correlated with the weight and body-mass index. What do the results of this study add? It was found that SF and VAT are important factors in the prediction of birth weight, like the abdominal circumference (AC). What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The measurement of VAT and SF thickness in prediction of fetal weight could reduce a weight estimation error.",-1
Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin Levels in Young Men Are Associated With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Midlife,"Introduction:                    Cross-sectional data note lower levels of testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in men with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Whether sex hormone levels in young men are predictive of later risk of NAFLD is not known.              Methods:                    Among men in the prospective population-based multicenter Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (mean age 50; n = 837), we assessed whether testosterone and SHBG levels measured at study year 10 (median age 35 years) were associated with prevalent NAFLD at study year 25. NAFLD was defined using noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan after excluding other causes of hepatic steatosis. The association of testosterone and SHBG with prevalent NAFLD was assessed by logistic regression.              Results:                    Total testosterone levels in young men were inversely associated with subsequent prevalent NAFLD on unadjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.7, P < 0.001), although no longer significant after adjustment for year 10 metabolic covariates as well as change in metabolic covariates from years 10 to 25 (OR 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.27). In contrast, there was a significant inverse association of SHBG with prevalent NAFLD, independent of testosterone and metabolic covariates (OR 0.68, OR 0.51-0.92, P = 0.013). On formal mediation testing, visceral adiposity was found to explain â?1.0% (95% confidence interval 27%-73%) of the association of lower SHBG with prevalent NAFLD.              Conclusions:                    Lower levels of SHBG in young men are associated with increase in prevalent NAFLD in middle age, independent of comprehensive metabolic risk factors. SHBG may provide a novel marker of NAFLD risk in young men.",-1
Fluorescence Analysis of Circulating Exosomes for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using a Sensor Array and Deep Learning,"Emerging liquid biopsy methods for investigating biomarkers in bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, or urine can be used to perform noninvasive cancer detection. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of exosomes require improved methods to achieve the desired sensitivity and accuracy. Herein, we report our study on developing a breast cancer liquid biopsy system, including a fluorescence sensor array and deep learning (DL) tool AggMapNet. In particular, we used a 12-unit sensor array composed of conjugated polyelectrolytes, fluorophore-labeled peptides, and monosaccharides or glycans to collect fluorescence signals from cells and exosomes. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) processed the fluorescence spectral data of cells and cell-derived exosomes, demonstrating successful discrimination between normal and different cancerous cells and 100% accurate classification of different BC cells. For heterogeneous plasma-derived exosome analysis, CNN-based DL tool AggMapNet was applied to transform the unordered fluorescence spectra into feature maps (Fmaps), which gave a straightforward visual demonstration of the difference between healthy donors and BC patients with 100% prediction accuracy. Our work indicates that our fluorescent sensor array and DL model can be used as a promising noninvasive method for BC diagnosis.",-1
"Inositols, Probiotics, and Gestational Diabetes: Clinical and Epigenetic Aspects","There is growing interest in the potential role of different stereoisomers of inositol or their combination as well as probiotics supplementation in healthy glucose metabolism during pregnancy and in promoting offspring health. The aim of this review is to clarify the effects of several inositol and probiotics-based supplements in the prevention and treatment of gestational diabetes (GDM). Moreover, we will discuss the epigenetic aspects and their short- and long-term effects in response to probiotic intervention as well as the possible implications of these findings in guiding appropriate supplementation regimens in pregnancy.",-1
Serum Bile Acid Levels Before and After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Their Correlation with Obesity-Related Comorbidities,"Background and aims:                    The rising prevalence of morbid obesity is increasing the demand for bariatric surgery. The benefits observed after bariatric surgery seems to be not fully explained by surgery-induced weight loss or traditional cardiovascular risk factors regression or improvement. Some evidences suggest that bile acid (BA) levels change after bariatric surgery, thus suggesting that BA concentrations could influence some of the metabolic improvement induced by bariatric surgery. In this report, we have characterized circulating BA patterns and compared them to metabolic and vascular parameters before and after sleeve gastrectomy (SG).              Patients and methods:                    Seventy-nine subjects (27 males, 52 females, aged 45 Â± 12 years, mean BMI 45 Â± 7 kg/m2) SG candidates were included in the study. Before and about 12 months after SG, all subjects underwent a clinical examination, blood tests (including lipid profile, plasma glucose and insulin, both used for calculating HOMA-IR, and glycated hemoglobin), ultrasound visceral fat area estimation, ultrasound flow-mediated dilation evaluation, and determination of plasma BA concentrations.              Results:                    Before SG, both primary and secondary BA levels were higher in insulin-resistant obese subjects than in non-insulin resistant obese, and BA were positively associated with the markers of insulin-resistance. After SG, total (conjugated and unconjugated) cholic acids significantly decreased (p 0.007), and total lithocholic acids significantly increased (p 0.017). SG-induced total cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid changes were directly associated with surgery-induced glycemia (p 0.011 and 0.033 respectively) and HOMA-IR (p 0.016 and 0.012 respectively) changes.              Conclusions:                    Serum BA are associated with glucose metabolism and particularly with markers of insulin-resistance. SG modifies circulating BA pool size and composition. SG-induced BA changes are associated with insulin-resistance amelioration. In conclusion, an interplay between glucose metabolism and circulating BA exists but further studies are needed.",-1
The effect of time management training on time management and anxiety among nursing undergraduates,"Time management is an essential tool to enhance quality care and reduce stress in nursing professionals, who face a uniquely high-paced work environment with wide-ranging job demands. We evaluated the effect of a time-management training program on time management and anxiety in nursing undergraduate students. Study results showed that the training program significantly improved nursing undergraduates' time management and significantly decreased self-reported anxiety among the students post-intervention. This study is the first to examine the effect of a time-management training program based on time management disposition theory in China among Chinese nursing undergraduate students.",-1
3DGT-DDI: 3D graph and text based neural network for drug-drug interaction prediction,"Motivation:                    Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occur during the combination of drugs. Identifying potential DDI helps us to study the mechanism behind the combination medication or adverse reactions so as to avoid the side effects. Although many artificial intelligence methods predict and mine potential DDI, they ignore the 3D structure information of drug molecules and do not fully consider the contribution of molecular substructure in DDI.              Results:                    We proposed a new deep learning architecture, 3DGT-DDI, a model composed of a 3D graph neural network and pre-trained text attention mechanism. We used 3D molecular graph structure and position information to enhance the prediction ability of the model for DDI, which enabled us to deeply explore the effect of drug substructure on DDI relationship. The results showed that 3DGT-DDI outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. It achieved an 84.48% macro F1 score in the DDIExtraction 2013 shared task dataset. Also, our 3D graph model proves its performance and explainability through weight visualization on the DrugBank dataset. 3DGT-DDI can help us better understand and identify potential DDI, thereby helping to avoid the side effects of drug mixing.

"The effectiveness of pistachio on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes and metabolic syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background and aims:                    Pistachio nuts have been considered to improve dysglycemia. However, there are controversial results. This systematic review and meta-analysis carried out to evaluate the effects of pistachio nuts on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome.              Methods:                    Medline/PubMed, ProQuest, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Cochrane library, and ScienceDirect were systematically searched to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used to conduct the study.              Results:                    Six RCTs were included in the review. Treatment with pistachio nuts exerted a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG) level (OR = 1.7, 95% CI; 1.2-2.4, P = 0.002, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.731) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index (OR = 1.5, 95% CI; 1.0-2.4, P = 0.043, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.617), but no significant improvement was observed in regard to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level (OR = 1.4, 95% CI; 0.9-2.1 P = 0.089, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.957) and fasting plasma insulin (FPI) level (OR = 1.3, 95% CI; 0.9-1.9, P = 0.133, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.776).              Conclusions:                    Pistachio nuts might cause a significant reduction in FBG and HOMA-IR, although HbA1c and FPI might not significantly improve in patients suffering from or at risk of T2DM.",-1
One-hour plasma glucose combined with skin autofluorescence identifies subjects with pre-diabetes: the DIAPASON study,"Introduction:                    The major challenge for diabetes prevention is early identification of individuals at risk to allow for implementation of measures to delay the onset of future disease. Measures such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are equally appropriate for identifying pre-diabetes and diabetes, but do not all identify the disease in the same individual. We tested the utility of a diagnostic method combining FPG, 2hPG and HbA1c for early evaluation and easy identification of pre-diabetes.              Research design and methods:                    531 subjects underwent skin autofluorescence (SAF) and glycemia analyses. We created two classification groups based on the American Diabetes Association diagnosis guidelines: (1) based on 2hPG and (2) based on a new combination of three glycemia parameters (the three-criteria strategy (3-c)). Logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the associations.              Results:                    SAF showed high associations for both 3-c definition and 2hPG definition alone. These associations appeared stronger in 3-c than those in 2hPG. The non-invasive SAF measurement outperformed 2hPG in the detection of dysglycemia or pre-diabetes. Stepwise selections identified 1-hour postload glucose (1hPG) as variable identifying pre-diabetes using the 2hPG criterion, and the model based on 1hPG plus SAF appeared to be the best association using the 3-c strategy.              Conclusions:                    1hPG coupled with SAF showed a strong association in the evaluation of pre-diabetes using the 3-c method.",-1
Histiocytic Sarcoma with Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma of Urinary Bladder,"We report a rare case of histiocytic sarcoma in association with invasive urothelial carcinoma involving the urinary bladder. A 67-year male patient, who presented with a complaint of macroscopic hematuria, was found to have a mass on urinary system ultrasonography. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the mass, which showed a 52Ã24 mm mass on the posterior wall of the bladder. The cystoscopic examination revealed two suspicious areas in close proximity to one another with solid-papillary character. The tissue samples were collected by means of transurethral resection. The evaluation of these samples revealed two distinct neoplastic patterns. The areas of invasive urothelial carcinoma infiltrating lamina propria were noted on the surface in addition to diffuse sheets of large cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and ample clear cytoplasm, with a patternless pattern among small lymphocytes in myxoid background in the lamina propria. The positive reactions were observed in these areas with CD45, fascin, and CD68, a histiocytic marker. The histopathological diagnosis was histiocytic sarcoma in combination with invasive urothelial carcinoma. Histiocytic sarcoma may mimic several other malignant lesions, and only immunohistochemistry can identify this tumour to allow correct treatment. We present this rare case to emphasise that this phenomenon should be considered in unusual tumors and sites. Key Words: Urinary bladder, Histiocytic sarcoma, Invasive urothelial carcinoma.",-1
A knowledge-driven network for fine-grained relationship detection between miRNA and disease,"Increasing biological evidence indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in exploring the pathogenesis of various human diseases (especially in tumors). Mining disease-related miRNAs is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Compared with the traditional experimental methods with the significant limitations of high cost, long cycle and small scale, the methods based on computing have the advantages of being cost-effective. However, although the current methods based on computational biology can accurately predict the correlation between miRNAs and disease, they can not predict the detailed association information at a fine level. We propose a knowledge-driven approach to the fine-grained prediction of disease-related miRNAs (KDFGMDA). Different from the previous methods, this method can finely predict the clear associations between miRNA and disease, such as upregulation, downregulation or dysregulation. Specifically, KDFGMDA extracts triple information from massive experimental data and existing datasets to construct a knowledge graph and then trains a depth graph representation learning model based on knowledge graph to complete fine-grained prediction tasks. Experimental results show that KDFGMDA can predict the relationship between miRNA and disease accurately, which is of far-reaching significance for medical clinical research and early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases. Additionally, the results of case studies on three types of cancers, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and expression difference analysis further provide the effectiveness and feasibility of KDFGMDA to detect potential candidate miRNAs.

MicroRNA 148a Suppresses Tuberculous Fibrosis by Targeting NOX4 and POLDIP2,"Extracellular matrix production by pleural mesothelial cells in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis contributes to tuberculous fibrosis. NOX4 is involved in the pathogenesis of tuberculous fibrosis. In this study, we evaluated whether NOX4 gene-targeting microRNAs showed protective effects in tuberculosis fibrosis. TargetScan prediction software was used to identify candidate microRNAs that bind the 3' UTRs of NOX4, and microRNA-148a (miR-148a) was selected as the best miRNA candidate. A repressed and forced expression assay in Met5A cells was performed to investigate the causal relationship between miR-148a and NOX4. The role of miR-148a in tuberculous pleural fibrosis was studied using a murine model of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) pleural infection. Heat-killed M. tuberculosis (HKMT) induces NOX4 and POLDIP2 expression. We demonstrated the inhibitory effect of miR-148a on NOX4 and POLDIP2 expression. The increased expression of miR-148a suppressed HKMT-induced collagen-1A synthesis in PMC cells. In the BCG pleurisy model, miR-148a significantly reduced fibrogenesis and epithelial mesenchymal transition. High levels of miR-148a in tuberculous pleural effusion can be interpreted as a self-limiting homeostatic response. Our data indicate that miR-148a may protect against tuberculous pleural fibrosis by regulating NOX4 and POLDIP2.",-1
Research on the Effectiveness of Probabilistic Stochastic Convolution Neural Network Algorithm in Physical Education Teaching Evaluation,"In practice, PE teaching evaluation based on probabilistic convolutional neural network still faces some practical problems. At present, the existing research mainly focuses on how to improve the accuracy of PE (physical education) teaching evaluation, but ignores the balance between accuracy and speed of the model, which is the key to achieve efficient PE teaching estimation. Aiming at the problem of optimization contradiction existing in the traditional probabilistic stochastic convolution neural network regression method, a position adaptive probabilistic stochastic convolution neural network regression method was proposed. Firstly, the basic principle of probabilistic and random convolution neural network regression method is given. Secondly, the contradiction and reasons between hot trial regression and coordinated regression are analyzed. It is found that the process heat will return to the optimization with irreconcilable contradiction with the coordinates due to the lack of learning parameters when the hot trial transforms the coordinates. The optimization contradiction will make the model tonot obtain the exact coordinates of the nodes. Then, based on the above analysis, the learnable parameters are introduced into the Softmax function, and the position adaptive Softmax model is proposed. Combining the model with the probabilistic stochastic convolution neural network regression method, the position adaptive probabilistic stochastic convolution neural network integral regression method is obtained. In order to reduce the training cost of this method, a simplified training strategy is proposed. Finally, the simulation software MATLAB is used for verification, and the functions of sample maintenance, probabilistic stochastic convolution neural network training, and neural network evaluation are realized. The experimental data show that the probabilistic stochastic convolutional neural network is feasible for teaching quality evaluation, meets the accuracy requirements, and indeed provides a convenient and practical tool for PE teaching quality evaluation.",-1
[Research on real-time detection system of catheter delivering force in vascular interventional robots],"In existing vascular interventional surgical robots, it is difficult to accurately detect the delivery force of the catheter/guidewire at the slave side. Aiming to solve this problem, a real-time force detection system was designed for vascular interventional surgical (VIS) robots based on catheter push force. Firstly, the transfer process of catheter operating forces in the slave end of the interventional robot was analyzed and modeled, and the design principle of the catheter operating force detection system was obtained. Secondly, based on the principle of stress and strain, a torque sensor was designed and integrated into the internal transmission shaft of the slave end of the interventional robot, and a data acquisition and processing system was established. Thirdly, an ATI high-precision torque sensor was used to build the experimental platform, and the designed sensor was tested and calibrated. Finally, sensor test experiments under ideal static/dynamic conditions and simulated catheter delivery tests based on actual human computed tomography (CT) data and vascular model were carried out. The results showed that the average relative detection error of the designed sensor system was 1.26% under ideal static conditions and 1.38% under ideal dynamic stability conditions. The system can detect on-line catheter operation force at high precision, which is of great significance towards improving patient safety in interventional robotic surgery.",-1
Novel Biomolecules in the Pathogenesis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus 2.0,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has become a major public health problem and one of the most discussed issues in modern obstetrics. GDM is associated with serious adverse perinatal outcomes and long-term health consequences for both the mother and child. Currently, the importance and purposefulness of finding a biopredictor that will enable the identification of women with an increased risk of developing GDM as early as the beginning of pregnancy are highly emphasized. Both ""older"" molecules, such as adiponectin and leptin, and ""newer"" adipokines, including fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), have proven to be of pathophysiological importance in GDM. Therefore, in our previous review, we presented 13 novel biomolecules, i.e., galectins, growth differentiation factor-15, chemerin, omentin-1, osteocalcin, resistin, visfatin, vaspin, irisin, apelin, FABP4, fibroblast growth factor 21, and lipocalin-2. The purpose of this review is to present the potential and importance of another nine lesser known molecules in the pathogenesis of GDM, i.e., 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF), angiopoietin-like protein-8 (ANGPTL-8), nesfatin-1, afamin, adropin, fetuin-A, zonulin, secreted frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs), and amylin. It seems that two of them, fetuin-A and zonulin in high serum levels, may be applied as biopredictors of GDM.",-1
Chlorothalonil alters the gut microbiota and reduces the survival of immature honey bees reared in vitro,"Background:                    Chlorothalonil is a nonsystemic fungicide, and it is one of the most widely detected pesticides in bee hives. The effect of chlorothalonil on the survival, weight, and gut microbiota of immature Apis mellifera L. reared in vitro was studied.              Results:                    Larvae were fed 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 Î¼g/mL chlorothalonil and compared with larvae fed the negative control (diet without any additives), positive control (45 mg/L dimethoate), and solvent control (2% acetone). Compared with the control groups, the survival of the 2, 4, 8, and 16 Î¼g/mL chlorothalonil treatments was significantly reduced. The no-observed-adverse-effect concentration of chlorothalonil was 1 Î¼g/mL. Chlorothalonil had no significant effect on larval weight. The gut bacterial community composition of newly emerged bees was determined by PacBio 16S rDNA gene sequencing. linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEFSe) analysis showed that Pseudomonadales and Burkholderiales were affected by exposure to chlorothalonil.              Conclusion:                    Chlorothalonil reduced the survival of honey bee larvae and altered the gut microbiota of newly emerged bees. The risk of pesticides to honey bees is related to their toxicity and exposure dose.",-1
Metformin in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Molecular Pathways and Its Clinical Implications,"Metformin is a synthetic biguanide that improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis. Aside being the first-line therapy for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), many pleiotropic effects have been discovered in recent years, such as its capacity to reduce cancer risk and tumorigenesis. Although widely studied, the effect of metformin on thyroid cancer remains controversial. Potential mechanisms for its growth inhibitory effects have been elucidated in various preclinical studies that involved pathways related to adenosine mono-phosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH), and the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB). Hyperinsulinemia increases cell glucose uptake and oxidative stress, and promotes thyroid cell growth, leading to hyperproliferation, carcinogenesis, and the development of malignant tumors. Furthermore, it has also been related to thyroid nodules size in nodular disease, as well as tumoral size in patients with thyroid cancer. Several clinical studies concluded that metformin might have an important role as an adjuvant therapy to reduce the growth of benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. This suggests that metformin might be useful for patients with differentiated or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance or diabetes.",-1
Research on Impulse Power Load Forecasting Based on Improved Recurrent Neural Networks,"Deep learning is good at extracting the required feature quantity from the massive input information through multiple hidden layers and completing the learning through training to achieve the task of load forecasting. The impulse power load data contain a lot of noise, burrs, and strong randomness. As an improved recurrent neural networks, the output of long short-term memory (LSTM) network is not only related to the current input, but also closely related to the historical information, which can effectively predict the impact power load. An impulse power load forecasting model based on improved recurrent neural networks is proposed. To solve the training difficulties caused by deep networks, database is divided into training data set and test data set. To accelerate running speed and improve accuracy and reliability, parameter setting in deep learning neural network is analyzed. The proposed load forecasting model is verified by simulation and compared with the existing methods. Taking the average relative error as the standard, the effectiveness of the proposed model for the forecasting of impulse power load connected to the bus is verified.",-1
Dietary calories and lipids synergistically shape adipose tissue cellularity during postnatal growth,"Objective:                    The susceptibility to abdominal obesity and the metabolic syndrome is determined to a substantial extent during childhood and adolescence, when key adipose tissue characteristics are established. Although the general impact of postnatal nutrition is well known, it is not clear how specific dietary components drive adipose tissue growth and how this relates to the risk of metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.              Methods:                    Adipose tissue growth including cell proliferation was analyzed in juvenile mice upon dietary manipulation with in vivo nucleotide labeling. The proliferative response of progenitors to specific fatty acids was assayed in primary cultures. Long-term metabolic consequences were assessed through transient dietary manipulation post-weaning with a second obesogenic challenge in adulthood.              Results:                    Dietary lipids stimulated adipose tissue progenitor cell proliferation in juvenile mice independently of excess caloric intake and calorie-dependent adipocyte hypertrophy. Excess calories increased mitogenic IGF-1 levels systemically, whereas palmitoleic acid was able to enhance the sensitivity of progenitors to IGF-1, resulting in synergistic stimulation of proliferation. Early transient consumption of excess lipids promoted hyperplastic adipose tissue expansion in response to a second dietary challenge in adulthood and this correlated with abdominal obesity and hyperinsulinemia.              Conclusions:                    Dietary lipids and calories differentially and synergistically drive adipose tissue proliferative growth and the programming of the metabolic syndrome in childhood.",-1
When more is less in financial decision-making: financial literacy magnifies framing effects,"In recent years, the financial world has become more complex and intricate. In this context, numeracy and, particularly, financial literacy, are seen as paramount in providing consumers with the knowledge and confidence required to take part in financial markets. Despite some indicative empirical findings, it is still to be ascertained how the two competences differentially contribute to the quality of decision-making in financial contexts. Furthermore, it is still unknown to what degree financial literacy and numeracy, taken as relevant mind-ware for financial decision-making, are effective in guarding against well-documented biases such as loss aversion and framing effects. This study aims to clarify these issues by employing an experimental task, conceived as an approximation to real-world decision-making involving the sale of shares. Our results suggest that numeracy and financial literacy affect decision-making differently in a pattern that, in part, runs counter to conventional economic theory. The data indicate that numeracy promotes a pattern of choices closer to economic rationality, while financial literacy can prove counterproductive and may amplify cognitive biases, namely framing effects and loss aversion. The outcomes are interpreted in light of dual-process theories, and the political implications discussed.",-1
Biological Differences Between Ovarian Cancer-associated Fibroblasts and Contralateral Normal Ovary-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells,"Background/aim:                    The aim of this study was to clarify the biological differences between ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts (OCa-CAFs) and normal ovary-derived mesenchymal stem cells (NO-MSCs).              Materials and methods:                    Surgically resected ovarian cancer and contralateral normal ovarian tissue samples were cut into small pieces for culture as ""explants"". The number of outgrown cells, their proliferative kinetics, and expression levels of cell surface markers of CAFs, as well as three miRNAs in OCa-CAFs and NO-MSCs were compared directly. Differentially expressed genes between both groups were also investigated.              Results:                    Comparable numbers of outgrown cells were harvested from both groups. Significantly higher expression of Î±-smooth muscle actin and miR-142 was found in OCa-CAFs, which decreased significantly during ex vivo cell expansion. A total of 21 differentially expressed genes were identified between both groups.              Conclusion:                    OCa-CAFs showed different biological properties in direct comparison with NO-MSCs, which might play major roles in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.",-1
Histone methylation-mediated microRNA-32-5p down-regulation in sensory neurons regulates pain behaviors via targeting Cav3.2 channels,"microRNA (miRNA)âmediated gene regulation has been studied as a therapeutic approach, but its functional regulatory mechanism in neuropathic pain is not well understood. Here, we identify that miRNA-32-5p (miR-32-5p) is a functional RNA in regulating trigeminal-mediated neuropathic pain. High-throughput sequencing and qPCR analysis showed that miR-32-5p was the most down-regulated miRNA in the injured trigeminal ganglion (TG) of rats. Intra-TG injection of miR-32-5p agomir or overexpression of miR-32-5p by lentiviral delivery in neurons of the injured TG attenuated established trigeminal neuropathic pain. miR-32-5p overexpression did not affect acute physiological pain, while miR-32-5p down-regulation in intact rats was sufficient to cause pain-related behaviors. Nerve injury increased the methylated histone occupancy of binding sites for the transcription factor glucocorticoid receptor in the miR-32-5p promoter region. Inhibition of the enzymes that catalyze H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 restored the expression of miR-32-5p and markedly attenuated pain behaviors. Further, miR-32-5pâtargeted Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels and decreased miR-32-5p associated with neuropathic pain caused an increase in Cav3.2 protein expression and T-type channel currents. Conversely, miR-32-5p overexpression in injured TG suppressed the increased expression of Cav3.2 and reversed mechanical allodynia. Together, we conclude that histone methylation-mediated miR-32-5p down-regulation in TG neurons regulates trigeminal neuropathic pain by targeting Cav3.2 channels.",-1
Gut microbial trimethylamine is elevated in alcohol-associated hepatitis and contributes to ethanol-induced liver injury in mice,"There is mounting evidence that microbes residing in the human intestine contribute to diverse alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD) including the most deadly form known as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). However, mechanisms by which gut microbes synergize with excessive alcohol intake to promote liver injury are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether drugs that selectively target gut microbial metabolism can improve ALD has never been tested. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of microbe and host choline co-metabolites in healthy controls and AH patients, finding elevated levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) in AH. In subsequent studies, we treated mice with non-lethal bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D) inhibitors to blunt gut microbe-dependent production of TMA in the context of chronic ethanol administration. Indices of liver injury were quantified by complementary RNA sequencing, biochemical, and histological approaches. In addition, we examined the impact of ethanol consumption and TMA lyase inhibition on gut microbiome structure via 16S rRNA sequencing. We show the gut microbial choline metabolite TMA is elevated in AH patients and correlates with reduced hepatic expression of the TMA oxygenase flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Provocatively, we find that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial CutC/D activity protects mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. CutC/D inhibitor-driven improvement in ethanol-induced liver injury is associated with distinct reorganization of the gut microbiome and host liver transcriptome. The microbial metabolite TMA is elevated in patients with AH, and inhibition of TMA production from gut microbes can protect mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.",-1
The effect of visceral fat and elevated blood glucose on anxiety levels in college age students,"Anxiety is prevalent among young adults; research shows metabolic inflexibility, the inability to oxidize fat, can increase the occurrence of hyper-aroused states. Fasting blood glucose is the current protocol for assessing metabolic impairment. However, recent studies have shown young adults may have normal fasting blood glucose levels with underlying irregularities in postprandial glucose regulation, insulin secretion and cortisol release, which causes a pattern of visceral fat accumulation. Visceral fat of the volunteers was assessed using the DXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) full body scanning method; the waist was assessed by taking the circumference at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest to formulate a waist to height ratio (WHtR); fasting glucose levels were measured via point-of-care (POC) finger-stick method using the Abbott Precision blood glucose meter and anxiety levels. The Pearson R correlation test showed significance between GAD-7 and VAT Volume at r = 0.513 VAT Mass r = 0.514 body fat percentage r = 0.407 and Android r = 0.419. This correlation between GAD-7 and VAT Volume and VAT Mass shows the physiological connection between elevated visceral fat and heightened anxiety. High amounts of visceral fat may lead to an increase in insulin and cortisol levels. The study may suggest that increased fasting blood glucose is not necessarily the best predictor of metabolic dysregulation in a population of healthy college students.",-1
Overview of CF lung pathophysiology,"Defects of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein affect the homeostasis of chloride, bicarbonate, sodium, and water in the airway surface liquid, influencing the mucus composition and viscosity, which induces a severe condition of infection and inflammation along the whole life of CF patients. The introduction of CFTR modulators, novel drugs directly intervening to rescue the function of CFTR protein, opens a new era of experimental research. The review summarizes the most recent advancements to understand the characteristics of the infective and inflammatory pathology of CF lungs.",-1
"Effects of Time-Restricted Feeding during Ramadan on Dietary Intake, Body Composition and Metabolic Outcomes","Ramadan fasting is a form of time-restricted feeding which combines a fast and feast period daily for a duration of one month every year. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink consumption from dawn till sunset and this change in the meal schedule and frequency results in significant changes to the composition of the diet, such as energy and nutrient intake. These changes in dietary habits and their corresponding effects on cardiometabolic disease risk are compiled in this review. Ramadan fasting shows limited benefits to body composition via reductions in body mass in both healthy and obese individuals, although the results are often found to be transient and heterogeneous. There is, however, a more consistent improvement in blood lipid profile during Ramadan fasting, which often lasts beyond the Ramadan period. The results for glucose homeostasis, on the contrary, are more conflicting and inconclusive. The heterogeneity in the findings from the various studies can be generally attributed to cultural variations in dietary habits, differences in the duration of fasting due to seasonal/climatic differences at various geographical locations, age, gender and socioeconomic status, as well as other health and lifestyle factors of the various study populations.",-1
Effect of data leakage in brain MRI classification using 2D convolutional neural networks,"In recent years, 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively used to diagnose neurological diseases from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data due to their potential to discern subtle and intricate patterns. Despite the high performances reported in numerous studies, developing CNN models with good generalization abilities is still a challenging task due to possible data leakage introduced during cross-validation (CV). In this study, we quantitatively assessed the effect of a data leakage caused by 3D MRI data splitting based on a 2D slice-level using three 2D CNN models to classify patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Our experiments showed that slice-level CV erroneously boosted the average slice level accuracy on the test set by 30% on Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), 29% on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 48% on Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and 55% on a local de-novo PD Versilia dataset. Further tests on a randomly labeled OASIS-derived dataset produced about 96% of (erroneous) accuracy (slice-level split) and 50% accuracy (subject-level split), as expected from a randomized experiment. Overall, the extent of the effect of an erroneous slice-based CV is severe, especially for small datasets.",-1
Abdominal Fat in Individuals with Overweight Reduced by Consumption of a 1975 Japanese Diet: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective:                    This study aimed to investigate whether the intake of the 1975 Japanese diet (JD) could reduce the amount of abdominal fat in people with overweight.              Methods:                    Using a single-blind randomized controlled trial, the modern diet (MD) was compared with the 1975-type JD, which is based on the MD but includes five characteristics of the 1975 JD in an enhanced form. Overweight people were randomly assigned to an MD group (n = 30) and a JD group (n = 30). The participants consumed test diets that were provided three times a day for 28 days. Body composition measurements and blood biochemical examinations were performed before and after the test diet intake, and the proportions of change were compared.              Results:                    Those in the JD group had significantly decreased BMI, fat mass, and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein (P = 0.002, 0.015, 0.014, 0.012, and 0.039, respectively) and significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with those in the MD group (P = 0.020).              Conclusions:                    The intake of a diet with the characteristics of the 1975 JD may have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism in people with overweight and reduce the onset risk of metabolism-related disorders, such as obesity and diabetes.",-1
Mosquitoes of the Maculipennis complex in Northern Italy,"The correct identification of mosquito vectors is often hampered by the presence of morphologically indiscernible sibling species. The Maculipennis complex is one of these groups that include both malaria vectors of primary importance and species of low/negligible epidemiological relevance, of which distribution data in Italy are outdated. Our study was aimed at providing an updated distribution of Maculipennis complex in Northern Italy through the sampling and morphological/molecular identification of specimens from five regions. The most abundant species was Anopheles messeae (2032), followed by Anopheles maculipennis s.s. (418), Anopheles atroparvus (28) and Anopheles melanoon (13). Taking advantage of ITS2 barcoding, we were able to finely characterize tested mosquitoes, classifying all the Anopheles messeae specimens as Anopheles daciae, a taxon with debated rank to which we referred as species inquirenda (sp. inq.). The distribution of species was characterized by Ecological Niche Models (ENMs), fed by recorded points of presence. ENMs provided clues on the ecological preferences of the detected species, with An. daciae sp. inq. linked to stable breeding sites and An. maculipennis s.s. more associated to ephemeral breeding sites. We demonstrate that historical Anopheles malaria vectors are still present in Northern Italy.",-1
Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor of the Cervix,"The occurrence of primary malignant peripheral neurilemmoma in the female cervix without neurofibromatosis type 1 is extremely rare. We, herein, report a case of a 46-year woman with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) involving the cervix. The patient was admitted to the hospital because of irregular vaginal bleeding. Pelvic CT suggested the presence of cervical mass, and the patient accepted radical hysterectomy. Following the surgery, MPNST was diagnosed by a combination of histology and immunohistochemistry. One year later, the patient developed recurrence and pulmonary metastasis and received sequentially epiubicin/ifosfamide, dacarbazine, and etoposide/cisplatin multi-line chemotherapy. The prognosis of MPNST is poor, which is related to its invasiveness, high recurrence and metastasis rates. The patient was treated with surgery, multi-line chemotherapy and targeted therapy, but the overall survival (OS) was 44 months. It is the first reported case of cervical MPNST receiving combined treatment. Key Words: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, Cervix, Pulmonary metastasis, Hysterectomy, Chemotherapy.",-1
Knockdown of LINC00511 decreased cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer by elevating miR-625 level to suppress the expression of leucine rich repeat containing eight volume-regulated anion channel subunit E,"Background:                    LINC00511 has been reported as a biomarker related to the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the molecular mechanism and exact functions of LINC00511 in chemoresistance of NSCLC remain to be elucidated.              Methods:                    RT-qPCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression of LINC00511, miR-625, and leucine rich repeat containing 8 volume-regulated anion channel subunit E (LRRC8E). Western blotting detected the protein levels of Ki-67, MMP-9, cleaved-caspase-3. The interaction between miR-625 and LINC00511 or LRRC8E was verified by luciferase reporter assays. CCK-8, TUNEL, and Transwell assays were used to evaluate IC50 value, proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells.              Results:                    In our study, it was discovered that the levels of LINC00511 and LRRC8E were increased, while miR-625 expression was decreased in NSCLC tissues, DDP-resistant NSCLC cells, and non-resistant NSCLC cells. LINC00511 depletion significantly curbed cell growth, IC50 value, and metastasis in DDP-resistant NSCLC cells. In addition, the influence of LINC00511 deficiency on the DDP resistance in NSCLC was overturned by suppressing miR-625. Furthermore, LRRC8E overexpression abolished the promotive effect of miR-625 abundance on the DDP sensitivity in DDP-resistant NSCLC cells.              Conclusion:                    Our results demonstrated that LINC00511 increased DDP resistance in NSCLC by suppressing miR-625 to upregulate LRRC8E.",-1
Laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy in endometrial cancer patients with obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis of conversions and complications,"Objective data:                    Robotic assistance may facilitate completion of minimally invasive hysterectomy, which is the standard of care for the treatment of early-stage endometrial cancer, in patients for whom conventional laparoscopy is challenging. The aim of this systematic review was to assess conversion to laparotomy and perioperative complications after laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy in patients with endometrial cancer and obesity (body mass index, â?0 kg/m2).              Study:                    We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (January 1, 2000, to July 18, 2018) for studies of patients with endometrial cancer and obesity (body mass index, â?0 kg/m2) who underwent primary hysterectomy.              Study appraisal and synthesis methods:                    We determined the pooled proportions of conversion, organ/vessel injury, venous thromboembolism, and blood transfusion. We assessed risk of bias with the Institute of Health Economics Quality Appraisal Checklist for single-arm studies, and Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Scale for double-arm studies.              Results:                    We identified 51 observational studies that reported on 10,800 patients with endometrial cancer and obesity (study-level body mass index, 31.0-56.3 kg/m2). The pooled proportions of conversion from laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomy were 6.5% (95% confidence interval, 4.3-9.9) and 5.5% (95% confidence interval, 3.3-9.1), respectively, among patients with a body mass index of â?0 kg/m2, and 7.0% (95% confidence interval, 3.2-14.5) and 3.8% (95% confidence interval, 1.4-9.9) among patients with body mass index of â?0 kg/m2. Inadequate exposure because of adhesions/visceral adiposity was the most common reason for conversion for both laparoscopic (32%) and robotic hysterectomy (61%); however, intolerance of the Trendelenburg position caused 31% of laparoscopic conversions and 6% of robotic hysterectomy conversions. The pooled proportions of organ/vessel injury (laparoscopic, 3.5% [95% confidence interval, 2.2-5.5]; robotic hysterectomy, 1.2% [95% confidence interval, 0.4-3.4]), venous thromboembolism (laparoscopic, 0.5% [95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.2]; robotic hysterectomy, 0.5% [95% confidence interval, 0.1-2.0]), and blood transfusion (laparoscopic, 2.8% [95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.1]; robotic hysterectomy, 2.1% [95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.8]) were low and not appreciably different between arms.              Conclusion:                    Robotic and laparoscopic hysterectomy have similar rates perioperative complications in patients with endometrial cancer and obesity, but robotic hysterectomy may reduce conversions because of positional intolerance in patients with morbid obesity. Existing literature is limited by selection and confounding bias, and randomized trials are needed to inform practice standards in this population.",-1
Adipose tissue-specific ablation of Ces1d causes metabolic dysregulation in mice,"Carboxylesterase 1d (Ces1d) is a crucial enzyme with a wide range of activities in multiple tissues. It has been reported to localize predominantly in ER. Here, we found that Ces1d levels are significantly increased in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Intriguingly, a high level of Ces1d translocates onto lipid droplets where it digests the lipids to produce a unique set of fatty acids. We further revealed that adipose tissue-specific Ces1d knock-out (FKO) mice gained more body weight with increased fat mass during a high fat-diet challenge. The FKO mice exhibited impaired glucose and lipid metabolism and developed exacerbated liver steatosis. Mechanistically, deficiency of Ces1d induced abnormally large lipid droplet deposition in the adipocytes, causing ectopic accumulation of triglycerides in other peripheral tissues. Furthermore, loss of Ces1d diminished the circulating free fatty acids serving as signaling molecules to trigger the epigenetic regulations of energy metabolism via lipid-sensing transcriptional factors, such as HNF4Î±. The metabolic disorders induced an unhealthy microenvironment in the metabolically active tissues, ultimately leading to systemic insulin resistance.",-1
Computer Vision-Based Medical Cloud Data System for Back Muscle Image Detection,"The fast development of image recognition and information technology has influenced people's life and industry management mode not only in some common fields such as information management, but also has very much improved the working efficiency of various industries. In the healthcare field, the current highly disparate doctor-patient ratio leads to more and more doctors needing to undertake more and more patient treatment tasks. Back muscle image detection can also be considered a task in medical image processing. Similar to medical image processing, back muscle detection requires first processing the back image and extracting semantic features by convolutional neural networks, and then training classifiers to identify specific disease symptoms. To alleviate the workload of doctors in recognizing CT slices and ultrasound detection images and to improve the efficiency of remote communication and interaction between doctors and patients, this paper designs and implements a medical image recognition cloud system based on semantic segmentation of CT images and ultrasound recognition images. Accurate detection of back muscles was achieved using the cloud platform and convolutional neural network algorithm. Upon final testing, the algorithm of this system partially meets the accuracy requirements proposed by the requirements. The medical image recognition system established based on this semantic segmentation algorithm is able to handle all aspects of medical workers and patients in general in a stable manner and can perform image segmentation processing quickly within the required range. Then, this paper explores the effect of muscle activity on the lumbar region based on this system.",-1
The long and winding road to happiness: A randomized controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis of a positive psychology intervention for lonely people with health problems and a low socio-economic status,"Background:                    Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the positive psychology intervention 'Happiness Route' compared to an active control condition in a vulnerable population with an accumulation of health and psychosocial problems.              Methods:                    We conducted a randomized, single-blind, actively-controlled, parallel group study in seven municipalities in the Netherlands. To be eligible, participants had to experience loneliness, health problems and low socio-economic status. Each group received several home visits by a counsellor (two in the control condition, two to six in the experimental condition). In the Happiness Route, a happiness-based approach was used, whereas the control condition used a traditional problem-based approach. The primary outcome was well-being, measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF).              Results:                    Fifty-eight participants were randomized to the Happiness Route, 50 to the control condition. Participants were severely lonely, had on average three health problems and less than 5% had paid work. The total MHC-SF score, emotional and social well-being, depression and loneliness improved significantly over the nine-month period in both conditions (p < .05), but there were no significant changes between the conditions across time. Languishing decreased significantly from 33% at baseline to 16% at follow-up among the Happiness Route participants but did not change significantly in the control condition. No significant improvement over time was found in psychological well-being, resilience, purpose in life, health-related quality of life and social participation. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that expected saved costs per QALY lost was â?19,948 for the Happiness Route, relative to the control condition. The probability was 83% that the Happiness Route was cost saving and 54% that the Happiness Route was cost-effective at a willingness to accept a threshold of â?00,000.              Conclusions:                    Mental health status of both groups improved considerably. However, we could not demonstrate that the Happiness Route yielded better health outcomes compared to the control condition. Nevertheless, the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that the Happiness Route is an acceptable intervention from a health-economic point of view. Our results should be viewed in light of the fact that we could not include the planned number of participants.

Prediabetes uncovers differential gene expression at fasting and in response to oral glucose load in immune cells,"Background and objective:                    Metabolic disorders including diabetes are associated with immune cell dysfunction. However, the effect of normal glucose metabolism or impairment thereof on immune cell gene expression is not well known. Hence, in this cross-sectional pilot study, we sought to determine the differences in gene expression in the peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) of normal glucose tolerant (NGT) and prediabetic (PD) Asian Indian men, at fasting and in response to 75 g oral glucose load.              Methods:                    Illumina HT12 bead chip-based microarray was performed on PBMCs at fasting and 2-h post load conditions for NGT (N = 6) and PD (N = 9) subjects. Following normalization and due quality control of the raw data, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under different conditions within and across the two groups were identified using GeneSpring GX V12.0 software. Paired and unpaired Student's t-tests were applied along with fold change cut-offs for appropriate comparisons. Validation of the microarray data was carried out through real-time qPCR analysis. Significantly regulated biological pathways were analyzed by employing DEGs and DAVID resource. Deconvolution of the DEGs between NGT and PD subjects at fasting was performed using CIBERSORT and genes involved in regulatory T-cell (Treg) function were further analyzed for biological significance.              Results:                    Glucose load specifically altered the expression of 112 genes in NGT and 356 genes in PD subjects. Biological significance analysis revealed transient up-regulation of innate and adaptive immune response related genes following oral glucose load in NGT individuals, which was not observed in PD subjects. Instead, in the PD group, glucose load led to an increase in the expression of pro-atherogenic and anti-angiogenic genes. Comparison of gene expression at fasting state in PD versus NGT revealed 21,707 differentially expressed genes. Biological significance analysis of the immune function related genes between these two groups (at fasting) revealed higher gene expression of members of the TLR signaling, MHC class II molecules, and T-cell receptor, chemotaxis and adhesion pathways in PD subjects. Expression of interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) and TNFÎ± was higher and that of type-1 interferons and TGF-Î² was lower at fasting state in PD subjects compared to NGT. Additionally, expression of multiple proteasome subunits and protein arginine methyl transferase genes (PRMTs) were higher and that of Treg specific genes was significantly distinct at fasting in PD subjects compared to NGT.              Conclusion:                    Prediabetes uncovers constitutive TLR activation, enhanced IFN-Î³ signaling, and Treg dysfunction at fasting along with altered gene expression response to oral glucose load.",-1
Biomarker of Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by abnormal accumulation of Î±-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, which subsequently causes motor symptoms. Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in PD. This neuroinflammatory neurodegeneration involves the activation of microglia, upregulation of proinflammatory factors, and gut microbiota. In this review, we summarized the recent findings on detection of PD by using inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±; regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP); and radiotracers such as [11C]PK11195 and [18F]-FEPPA, as well as by monitoring disease progression and the treatment response. Many PD-causing mutations in SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN, PINK1, and DJ-1 are also associated with neuroinflammation. Several anti-inflammatory medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), inhibitors of TNF-Î± and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), agonists of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³), and steroids, have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in in vivo or in vitro PD models. Clinical trials applying objective biomarkers are required to investigate the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory medications for PD.",-1
Investigating the cecal microbiota in broiler poultry farms and its potential relationships with animal welfare,"The present study assessed the modulation of cecal microbiota and correlations with Campylobacter colonization and animal welfare status. For these purposes, we conducted a cross sectional study of the cecal microbiota from 187 broilers reared in 13 batches from 10 poultry farms by performing 16S rRNA sequencing (regions V3-4). The welfare of each batch was assessed using a simplified Welfare QualityÂ® protocol, scoring higher in organic batches, compared to both antibiotic-free and conventional batches. The bioinformatics analyses were conducted in QIIME 2 and a linear discriminant analysis determined the association between microbiota and animals with different Campylobacter carriage status and welfare levels. In the microbiota from the subjects negative for Campylobacter or with high welfare scores, Bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum with the genus Megamonas significantly increased in abundance. A greater abundance of Parabacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Helicobacter in poultry negative for Campylobacter was also found at the genus level. Animals with the lowest welfare scores showed an increased abundance of Proteobacteria. The results suggested a different microbial composition and diversity in the analyzed groups.",-1
Occupational Therapy Interventions for Instrumental Activities of Daily Living for Adults With Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review,"Importance:                    Instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) are important for independence, safety, and productivity, and people with Parkinson's disease (PD) can experience IADL limitations. Occupational therapy practitioners should address IADLs with their clients with PD.              Objective:                    To systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness of occupational therapy interventions to improve or maintain IADL function in adults with PD.              Data sources:                    MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, OTseeker, and Cochrane databases from January 2011 to December 2018. Study Selection and Data Collection: Primary inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed journal articles describing Level 1-3 studies that tested the effect of an intervention within the scope of occupational therapy on an IADL outcome in people with PD. Three reviewers assessed records for inclusion, quality, and validity following Cochrane Collaboration and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.              Findings:                    Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into four themes on the basis of primary focus or type of intervention: physical activity, specific IADL-focused, cognitive rehabilitation, and individualized occupational therapy interventions. There were 9 Level 1b, 9 Level 2b, and 4 Level 3b studies. Strong strength of evidence was found for the beneficial effect of occupational therapy-related interventions for physical activity levels and handwriting, moderate strength of evidence for IADL participation and medication adherence, and low strength of evidence for cognitive rehabilitation.              Conclusions and relevance:                    Occupational therapy interventions can improve health management and maintenance (i.e., physical activity levels, medication management), handwriting, and IADL participation for people with PD. Further research is needed on cognitive rehabilitation. This review is limited by the small number of studies that specifically addressed IADL function in treatment and as an outcome. What This Article Adds: Occupational therapy intervention can be effective in improving or maintaining IADL performance and participation in people with PD. Occupational therapy practitioners can address IADL function through physical activity interventions, interventions targeting handwriting and medication adherence, and individualized occupational therapy interventions.",-1
Use of SGLT2 inhibitors during Ramadan: An expert panel statement,"Fasting from dawn to sunset, during the holy month of Ramadan, constitutes one of the five main pillars in Islam and is observed by the majority of Muslims. Owing to important physiological changes, Ramadan fasting holds a crucial place in the context of diabetes management. Approximately one-fifth of the world's Muslim population resides in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region. To discuss the challenges and management of diabetes during Ramadan fasting in the MEA region, a panel of 12 experts in the field of diabetes from across the MEA region attended two expert committee meetings held in Dubai. The key point of discussion was the safety and efficacy of the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) during Ramadan, based on outcomes of the recent clinical trials with SGLT2i. This is the first consensus recommendation on the management of diabetes with SGLT2i across the MEA region during Ramadan. The document summarizes expert views and opinions on the current management of diabetes with SGLT2i during Ramadan and aims to enhance the current knowledge and understanding on the issue of diabetes management during Ramadan. This will aid the physicians of the MEA region with appropriate decision-making for their patients during Ramadan.",-1
In Vitro Tumor Cell-Binding Assay to Select High-Binding Antibody and Predict Therapy Response for Personalized 64 Cu-Intraperitoneal Radioimmunotherapy against Peritoneal Dissemination of Pancreatic Cancer: A Feasibility Study,"Peritoneal dissemination of pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. We have reported that intraperitoneal radioimmunotherapy using a 64Cu-labeled antibody (64Cu-ipRIT) is a promising adjuvant therapy option to prevent this complication. To achieve personalized 64Cu-ipRIT, we developed a new in vitro tumor cell-binding assay (64Cu-TuBA) system with a panel containing nine candidate 64Cu-labeled antibodies targeting seven antigens (EGFR, HER2, HER3, TfR, EpCAM, LAT1, and CD98), which are reportedly overexpressed in patients with pancreatic cancer. We investigated the feasibility of 64Cu-TuBA to select the highest-binding antibody for individual cancer cell lines and predict the treatment response in vivo for 64Cu-ipRIT. 64Cu-TuBA was performed using six human pancreatic cancer cell lines. For three cell lines, an in vivo treatment study was performed with 64Cu-ipRIT using high-, middle-, or low-binding antibodies in each peritoneal dissemination mouse model. The high-binding antibodies significantly prolonged survival in each mouse model, while low-and middle-binding antibodies were ineffective. There was a correlation between in vitro cell binding and in vivo therapeutic efficacy. Our findings suggest that 64Cu-TuBA can be used for patient selection to enable personalized 64Cu-ipRIT. Tumor cells isolated from surgically resected tumor tissues would be suitable for analysis with the 64Cu-TuBA system in future clinical studies.",-1
Combining chemometric and phytochemical tools to isolate and characterize activity of Vismia gracilis compounds against Aedes aegypti,"Vismia gracilis extracts were tested against Aedes aegypti to assess mortality and behavioural effects. The leaf hexanic extract (L-Hex) presented increased larvicidal activity with exposure period: LC50 46.48 Âµg/mL (24 h) and LC50 20.57 Âµg/mL (48 h). Eight compounds were annotated/isolated from the L-Hex active extract, 4 benzophenones and 4 anthraquinones. Considering chemometric findings, the benzophenone moiety, tested as the commercial benzophenone, promoted larval mortality (LC50 16.35 Âµg/mL). Both the L-Hex extract and benzophenone induced intestinal damage in larvae. Benzophenone also promoted toxicity and behavioural effects in female adults. These findings highlighted the potential use of this class of compounds for developing vector-control products.",-1
In silico prediction of mosquito repellents for clothing application,"Use of protective clothing is a simple and efficient way to reduce the contacts with mosquitoes and consequently the probability of transmission of diseases spread by them. This mechanical barrier can be enhanced by the application of repellents. Unfortunately the number of available repellents is limited. As a result, there is a crucial need to find new active and safer molecules repelling mosquitoes. In this context, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) model was proposed for the design of repellents active on clothing. It was computed from a dataset of 2027 chemicals for which repellent activity on clothing was measured against Aedes aegypti. Molecules were described by means of 20 molecular descriptors encoding physicochemical properties, topological information and structural features. A three-layer perceptron was used as statistical tool. An accuracy of 87% was obtained for both the training and test sets. Most of the wrong predictions can be explained. Avenues for increasing the performances of the model have been proposed.",-1
High Interrater Variability in Intraoperative Language Testing and Interpretation in Awake Brain Mapping Among Neurosurgeons or Neuropsychologists: An Emerging Need for Standardization,"Objective:                    Brain mapping with direct electric stimulation is considered the gold standard for maximum safe resection of tumors affecting eloquent regions. However, no consensus exists in selection and interpretation of intraoperative testing for language and other cognitive domains. Our aim was to capture and statistically analyze variability in practices in intraoperative language testing among neurosurgeons and neuropsychologists in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world.              Methods:                    An electronic questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary team at Queen Square, London, and distributed internationally through selected organized societies. The survey included 2 domains: terminology and common understanding of clinical deficits; and selection of intraoperative tests used per specific brain region. Participants were stratified by specialty, years of experience, and monthly caseload. Data were analyzed using Krippendorff Î±, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance.              Results:                    A total of 137 specialists participated. A low agreement was recorded for each of the 20 questions (Krippendorff Î± = -0.023 to 0.312). Further subgroup analysis revealed low interrater reliability independent of specialism (neurosurgeons, Î± = 0.013-0.318 compared with nonneurosurgeons, Î± = -0.021 to 0.398; P = 0.808) and years of experience (<1 years, Î± = -0.003 to 0.282; 2-5 years, Î± = 0.009-0.327; 6-10 years, Î± = 0.003-0.234; and >10 years, Î± = -0.003 to 0.372; P = 0.200).              Conclusions:                    The current study documents high interrater variability, regardless of specialism and years of experience in the cohort of neurosurgeons and language specialists surveyed and may be applicable to a wider group of specialists, indicating the need to reduce interobserver, interinstitutional and interspecialty variability, reach consensus, and increase the validity, interpretation, and predictive power of intraoperative mapping.",-1
[Correlation between social psychology and personality characteristics and treatment options for adult patients with skeletal malocclusion],"Objective:                    This study aims to explore factors affecting the dental aesthetic social psychology of patients with skeletal malocclusion and to measure the relationship between the objective orthodontic requirements and the subjective treatment requirements of patients. This work provides a reference for doctors to measure patients' orthodontic treatment needs.              Methods:                    Adult patients with skeletal malocclusion were chosen as the research object. Questionnaire survey was used to analyze factors influencing the psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics questionnaire (PIDAQ), index of orthodontic treatment need (IOTN), and Eysenck personality questionnaire-revised short scale for Chinese (EPQ-RSC). The relationship among PIDAQ, IOTN, EPQ-RSC, and treatment options was also evaluated.              Results:                    Seventy-two valid questionnaires were collected from adult patients with skeletal malocclusion. 1) The PIDAQ scores significantly differed among different occupations (P<0.05) but were not affected by other general conditions such as gender and age. 2) Patients of different dental health component (DHC) grade and ages had different AC self-assessment scores (P<0.01, P<0.05). The AC self-assessment score was positively correlated with the PIDAQ score (P< 0.05). 3) Males accounted for a higher proportion of patients who received treatment. Younger patients (18-28 years old) were more likely to receive treat-ment when their own dental aesthetics were poor. People with the higher monthly expenditure accounted for the larger proportion of surgical patients. 4) The PIDAQ score had no significant effects on the choice of opera-tion (P>0.05). People with low educational level were more likely to receive surgery if their psychosocial impacts of dental aes-thetics were serious. 5) The score of psychoticism scale of EPQ-RSC and the educa-tional level had a mutual influence on the PIDAQ score (P<0.01). Moreover, the neuroticism scale and AC self-assessment scores had a mutual influence on the PIDAQ score (P<0.05). However, this study did not find a correlation between personality traits and treatment options.              Conclusions:                    Many factors, such as personal natural conditions, subjective aesthetic evaluation of teeth, and psychosocial impacts of dental aesthetics, affect patients' treatment options. Personality characteristics can play a certain role in dental aesthetics social psychology.",-1
Metformin Should Not Be Used to Treat Prediabetes,"Based on the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), in which metformin significantly decreased the development of diabetes in individuals with baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 110-125 vs. 100-109 mg/dL (6.1-6.9 vs. 5.6-6.0 mmol/L) and A1C levels 6.0-6.4% (42-46 mmol/mol) vs. <6.0% and in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, it has been suggested that metformin should be used to treat people with prediabetes. Since the association between prediabetes and cardiovascular disease is due to the associated nonglycemic risk factors in people with prediabetes, not to the slightly increased glycemia, the only reason to treat with metformin is to delay or prevent the development of diabetes. There are three reasons not to do so. First, approximately two-thirds of people with prediabetes do not develop diabetes, even after many years. Second, approximately one-third of people with prediabetes return to normal glucose regulation. Third, people who meet the glycemic criteria for prediabetes are not at risk for the microvascular complications of diabetes and thus metformin treatment will not affect this important outcome. Why put people who are not at risk for the microvascular complications of diabetes on a drug (possibly for the rest of their lives) that has no immediate advantage except to lower subdiabetes glycemia to even lower levels? Rather, individuals at the highest risk for developing diabetes-i.e., those with FPG concentrations of 110-125 mg/dL (6.1-6.9 mmol/L) or A1C levels of 6.0-6.4% (42-46 mmol/mol) or women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus-should be followed closely and metformin immediately introduced only when they are diagnosed with diabetes.",-1
The Role of Diet and Gut Microbiota in Regulating Gastrointestinal and Inflammatory Disease,"Diet is an important lifestyle factor that is known to contribute in the development of human disease. It is well established that poor diet plays an active role in exacerbating metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Our understanding of how the immune system drives chronic inflammation and disease pathogenesis has evolved in recent years. However, the contribution of dietary factors to inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and arthritis remain poorly defined. A western diet has been associated as pro-inflammatory, in contrast to traditional dietary patterns that are associated as being anti-inflammatory. This may be due to direct effects of nutrients on immune cell function. Diet may also affect the composition and function of gut microbiota, which consequently affects immunity. In animal models of inflammatory disease, diet may modulate inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and in other peripheral sites. Despite limitations of animal models, there is now emerging evidence to show that anti-inflammatory effects of diet may translate to human gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases. However, appropriately designed, larger clinical studies must be conducted to confirm the therapeutic benefit of dietary therapy.",-1
Probability of consolidation constrains novel serotype emergence in dengue fever virus,"Since their first sequencing 40 years ago, Dengue virus (DENV) genotypes have shown extreme coherence regarding the serotype class they encode. Considering that DENV is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus with a high mutation rate, this behavior is intriguing. Here, we explore the effect of various parameters on likelihood of new serotype emergence. In order to determine the time scales of such an event, we used a Timed Markov Transmission Model to explore the influences of sylvatic versus peri-urban transmission, viral mutation rate, and vertical transmission on the probabilities of novel serotype emergence. We found that around 1 000 years are required for a new serotype to emerge, consistent with phylogenetic analysis of extant dengue serotypes. Furthermore, we show that likelihood of establishing chains of mosquito-human-mosquito infection, known as consolidation, is the primary factor which constrains novel serotype emergence. Our work illustrates the restrictions on and provides a mechanistic explanation for the low probability of novel dengue virus serotype emergence and the low number of observed DENV serotypes.",-1
Non-invasive health prediction from visually observable features,"Background: The unprecedented development of Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised the healthcare industry. In the next generation of healthcare systems, self-diagnosis will be pivotal to personalised healthcare services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new screening and diagnostic approaches like mobile health are well-positioned to reduce disease spread and overcome geographical barriers. This paper presents a non-invasive screening approach to predict the health of a person from visually observable features using machine learning techniques. Images like face and skin surface of the patients are acquired using camera or mobile devices and analysed to derive clinical reasoning and prediction of the person's health. Methods: In specific, a two-level classification approach is presented. The proposed hierarchical model chooses a class by training a binary classifier at the node of the hierarchy. Prediction is then made using a set of class-specific reduced feature set. Results: Testing accuracies of 86.87% and 76.84% are reported for the first and second-level classification. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields favourable prediction results while greatly reduces the computational time. Conclusions: The study suggests that it is possible to predict the health condition of a person based on his/her face appearance using cost-effective machine learning approaches.",-1
Downregulation of lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 Confers Radiosensitivity to Gastric Cancer Cells via miR-1913/SETD1A Axis,"Long noncoding RNA FOXD2 adjacent opposite strand RNA1 (FOXD2-AS1) plays an oncogenic role in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the function of FOXD2-AS1 in regulating radiosensitivity of GC cells and its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. This study aimed to figure out the potential mechanisms of FOXD2-AS1 in regulating GC cell radiosensitivity. RT-qPCR revealed upregulation of FOXD2-AS1 in GC cells exposed to radiation. Subcellular fractionation assay was used to localize FOXD2-AS1 in GC cells. Colony formation, MTT, EdU, and flow cytometry assays were performed to investigate the role of FOXD2-AS1 in regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell apoptosis. Western blotting was used to assess protein levels of apoptosis-associated markers and SET domain containing 1A (SETD1A). Homologous recombination reporter assay was conducted to explore the effect of FOXD2-AS1 on DNA damage repair. The downstream molecules of FOXD2-AS1 were identified with RNA pulldown, luciferase reporter, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. The results showed that FOXD2-AS1 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and promoted cell apoptosis and radiosensitivity of GC. FOXD2-AS1 could bind with miR-1913 in GC cells. In addition, miR-1913 targeted SETD1A, which was highly expressed in GC cells. Overexpression of SETD1A reversed FOXD2-AS1 silencing-induced effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity of GC cells. In conclusion, knocking down FOXD2-AS1 enhances the radiosensitivity of GC cells by sponging miR-1913 to upregulate SETD1A expression.",-1
Multicenter Validation of Individual Preoperative Motor Outcome Prediction for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease,"Background:                    Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) is an established therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients suffering from motor response fluctuations despite optimal medical treatment, or severe dopaminergic side effects. Despite careful clinical selection and surgical procedures, some patients do not benefit from STN DBS. Preoperative prediction models are suggested to better predict individual motor response after STN DBS. We validate a preregistered model, DBS-PREDICT, in an external multicenter validation cohort.              Methods:                    DBS-PREDICT considered eleven, solely preoperative, clinical characteristics and applied a logistic regression to differentiate between weak and strong motor responders. Weak motor response was defined as no clinically relevant improvement on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, III, or IV, 1 year after surgery, defined as, respectively, 3, 5, and 3 points or more. Lower UPDRS III and IV scores and higher age at disease onset contributed most to weak response predictions. Individual predictions were compared with actual clinical outcomes.              Results:                    322 PD patients treated with STN DBS from 6 different centers were included. DBS-PREDICT differentiated between weak and strong motor responders with an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.76 and an accuracy up to 77%.              Conclusion:                    Proving generalizability and feasibility of preoperative STN DBS outcome prediction in an external multicenter cohort is an important step in creating clinical impact in DBS with data-driven tools. Future prospective studies are required to overcome several inherent practical and statistical limitations of including clinical decision support systems in DBS care.",-1
A 2 year physical activity and dietary intervention attenuates the increase in insulin resistance in a general population of children: the PANIC study,"Aims/hypothesis:                    We studied for the first time the long-term effects of a combined physical activity and dietary intervention on insulin resistance and fasting plasma glucose in a general population of predominantly normal-weight children.              Methods:                    We carried out a 2 year non-randomised controlled trial in a population sample of 504 children aged 6-9 years at baseline. The children were allocated to a combined physical activity and dietary intervention group (306 children at baseline, 261 children at 2-year follow-up) or a control group (198 children, 177 children) without blinding. We measured fasting insulin and fasting glucose, calculated HOMA-IR, assessed physical activity and sedentary time by combined heart rate and body movement monitoring, assessed dietary factors by a 4 day food record, used the Finnish Children Healthy Eating Index (FCHEI) as a measure of overall diet quality, and measured body fat percentage (BF%) and lean body mass by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The intervention effects on insulin, glucose and HOMA-IR were analysed using the intention-to-treat principle and linear mixed-effects models after adjustment for sex, age at baseline, and pubertal status at baseline and 2 year follow-up. The measures of physical activity, sedentary time, diet and body composition at baseline and 2 year follow-up were entered one-by-one as covariates into the models to study whether changes in these variables might partly explain the observed intervention effects.              Results:                    Compared with the control group, fasting insulin increased 4.65 pmol/l less (absolute change +8.96 vs +13.61 pmol/l) and HOMA-IR increased 0.18 units less (+0.31 vs +0.49 units) over 2 years in the combined physical activity and dietary intervention group. The intervention effects on fasting insulin (regression coefficient Î² for intervention effect -0.33 [95% CI -0.62, -0.04], p = 0.026) and HOMA-IR (Î² for intervention effect -0.084 [95% CI -0.156, -0.012], p = 0.023) were statistically significant after adjustment for sex, age at baseline, and pubertal status at baseline and 2 year follow-up. The intervention had no effect on fasting glucose, BF% or lean body mass. Changes in total physical activity energy expenditure, light physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, total sedentary time, the reported consumption of high-fat (â?0%) vegetable oil-based spreads, and FCHEI, but not a change in BF% or lean body mass, partly explained the intervention effects on fasting insulin and HOMA-IR.              Conclusions/interpretation:                    The combined physical activity and dietary intervention attenuated the increase in insulin resistance over 2 years in a general population of predominantly normal-weight children. This beneficial effect was partly mediated by changes in physical activity, sedentary time and diet but not changes in body composition.

Therapeutic Potential for Intractable Asthma by Targeting L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1,"Bronchial asthma is a chronic disease characterized by airway inflammation, obstruction, and hyperresponsiveness. CD4+ T cells, particularly T helper (Th) 2 cells, and their specific cytokines are important mediators in asthma pathogenesis. However, it has been established that Th subsets, other than Th2, as well as various cell types, including innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), significantly contribute to the development of allergic inflammation. These cells require facilitated amino acid uptake to ensure their full function upon activation. Emerging studies have suggested the potential of pharmacological inhibition of amino acid transporters to inhibit T cell activation and the application of this strategy for treating immunological and inflammatory disorders. In the present review, we explore the possibility of targeting L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) as a novel therapeutic approach for bronchial asthma, including its steroid-resistant endotypes.",-1
Performance Analysis of Conventional Machine Learning Algorithms for Diabetic Sensorimotor Polyneuropathy Severity Classification Using Nerve Conduction Studies,"Background:                    Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) is a major form of complication that arises in long-term diabetic patients. Even though the application of machine learning (ML) in disease diagnosis is very common and well-established in the field of research, its application in DSPN diagnosis using nerve conduction studies (NCS), is very limited in the existing literature.              Method:                    In this study, the NCS data were collected from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and its follow-up Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) clinical trials. The NCS variables are median motor velocity (m/sec), median motor amplitude (mV), median motor F-wave (msec), median sensory velocity (m/sec), median sensory amplitude (Î¼V), Peroneal Motor Velocity (m/sec), peroneal motor amplitude (mv), peroneal motor F-wave (msec), sural sensory velocity (m/sec), and sural sensory amplitude (Î¼V). Three different feature ranking techniques were used to analyze the performance of eight different conventional classifiers.              Results:                    The ensemble classifier outperformed other classifiers for the NCS data ranked when all the NCS features were used and provided an accuracy of 93.40%, sensitivity of 91.77%, and specificity of 98.44%. The random forest model exhibited the second-best performance using all the ten features with an accuracy of 93.26%, sensitivity of 91.95%, and specificity of 98.95%. Both ensemble and random forest showed the kappa value 0.82, which indicates that the models are in good agreement with the data and the variables used and are accurate to identify DSPN using these ML models.              Conclusion:                    This study suggests that the ensemble classifier using all the ten NCS variables can predict the DSPN severity which can enhance the management of DSPN patients.",-1
GM1 ganglioside modifies microglial and neuroinflammatory responses to Î±-synuclein in the rat AAV-A53T Î±-synuclein model of Parkinson's disease,"Among the pathological events associated with the dopaminergic neurodegeneration characteristic of Parkinson's disease (PD) are the accumulation of toxic forms of Î±-synuclein and microglial activation associated with neuroinflammation. Although numerous other processes may participate in the pathogenesis of PD, the two factors mentioned above may play critical roles in the initiation and progression of dopamine neuron degeneration in PD. In this study, we employed a slowly progressing model of PD using adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of human A53T Î±-synuclein into the substantia nigra on one side of the brain and examined the microglial response in the striatum on the injected side compared to the non-injected (control) side. We further examined the extent to which administration of the neuroprotective ganglioside GM1 influenced Î±-synuclein-induced glial responses. Changes in a number of microglial morphological measures (i.e., process length, number of endpoints, fractal dimension, lacunarity, density, and cell perimeter) were indicative of the presence of activated microglial and an inflammatory response on the injected side of the brain, compared to the control side. In GM1-treated animals, no significant differences in microglial morphology were observed between the injected and control striata. Follow-up studies showed that mRNA expression for several inflammation-related genes was increased on the A53T Î±-synuclein injected side vs. the non-injected side in saline-treated animals and that such changes were not observed in GM1-treated animals. These data show that inhibition of microglial activation and potentially damaging neuroinflammation by GM1 ganglioside administration may be among the many factors that contribute to the neuroprotective effects of GM1 in this model and possibly in human PD.",-1
An Improved Bearing Fault Diagnosis Model of Variational Mode Decomposition Based on Linked Extension Neural Network,"In bearing fault diagnosis, due to the insufficient obtained supervised data and the inevitable noise contained in the vibration signals, the problem of clustering bearing fault diagnosis with imbalanced data containing noise is caused. Thanks to the ability to quickly and fully learn boundary information in small samples, the extension neural network-type 2 algorithm (ENN-2) has the potential in imbalanced data clustering and has been gradually applied in fault diagnosis. Therefore, in order to improve the unstable clustering performance of ENN-2 caused by its heavy dependence on input order of samples, a novel algorithm called linked extension neural network (LENN) is developed by redesigning the correlation function and its iterative method, which greatly reduces the clustering iteration epochs of the algorithm. In addition, an evaluation index of clustering quality for this novel algorithm, extension density, is also proposed. After that, a bearing fault diagnosis model of variational mode decomposition (VMD) based denoising and LENN is proposed. Firstly, VMD is used to get intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and the correlation coefficients of IMFs are calculated for signal denoising. Secondly, the features are extracted from denoised signals and selected by PCA algorithm, and the fault diagnosis is finally completed by LENN. Compared with ENN-2, K-means, FCM, and DBSCAN based models, the proposed model identifies the faults with different severities more accurately and achieves superior diagnostic ability on different imbalance degrees of datasets, which can further lay a foundation for clustering fault diagnosis based on vibration signals.",-1

microRNA-146a as a biomarker for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy,"The pro-inflammatory, innate-immune system ribonucleic acid mediator microRNA-146a, constitutively expressed in the brain and central nervous system (CNS) of both the mouse and the human, is pathologically up-regulated in multiple transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) to several times its basal level. miRNA-146a: (i) exists as a ~22-ribonucleotide (nt) single-stranded non-coding RNA (sncRNA) whose sequence is unique and highly selected over evolution; (ii) is brain-, CNS- and lymphoid-tissue enriched and exhibits a 100% RNA sequence homology between the mouse and the human; (iii) has been repeatedly shown to play critical immunological and pro-inflammatory roles in the onset and propagation of several human CNS disorders including progressive, incapacitating, and lethal neurological syndromes that include prion disease (PrD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD); (iv) is a fascinating molecular entity because it is representative of the smallest class of soluble, information-carrying, amphipathic sncRNA yet described; (v) has capability to be induced by cellular stressors and the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB (p50/p65); (vi) has capability to post-transcriptionally regulate multiple mRNAs and cellular processes in neurological health and disease; (vii) is upregulated in human host cells after viral invasion by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) neurotropic viruses; and (viii) has an immense potential in neuro-degenerative disease therapeutics via anti-NF-kB and/or anti-miRNA-146a treatment strategies. In this short communication we provide for the first time evidence that miRNA-146a is a prominent sncRNA species in experimental murine prion disease, progressively increasing in the pre-symptomatic stages in C57BL/6J, SJL/J or Swiss Albino murine scrapie prion models. The highest miRNA-146a levels were quantified in these three different murine scrapie models exhibiting full symptomology of prion infection. The results suggest that miRNA-146a levels in the brain may be useful as an accessory diagnostic, prognostic or response-to-treatment biomarker to monitor the onset and development of PrD in experimental murine models that may also be extrapolated to be a relevant adjunct biomarker in human TSEs.",-1
The Development of Ethnic-Racial Identity Process and Its Relation to Civic Beliefs among Latinx and Black American Adolescents,"Despite associations between ethnic-racial identity processes (i.e., exploration and resolution) and positive psychosocial outcomes among adolescents, limited empirical research investigates longitudinal associations between these processes and civic beliefs. To address this gap in the literature, this research explored whether changes in ethnic-racial identity exploration and resolution predicted civic beliefs among adolescents. Participants included 400 Latinx (n = 121; 47.1% girls) and Black American (n = 279; 52.0% girls) adolescents in the 6th (n = 210), 7th (n = 113) and 8th Grades (n = 74). Neither initial levels nor changes in ethnic-racial identity exploration predicted civic beliefs across four time-points of the study, or across two years of middle school. Adolescents who demonstrated greater increases in ethnic-racial identity resolution across two years of middle school were likely to have greater civic beliefs by the end of the two years, as compared to adolescents who had smaller increases in resolution. These results suggest that adolescents who have an increasingly clear sense of their ethnic-racial selves may have greater access to cognitive and socioemotional resources that promote their development of beliefs on the need to advance the well-being of their communities.",-1
[Predictive value of D-dimer for deep venous thrombosis of lower extremity in adult burn patients],"Objective: To investigate the predictive value of D-dimer for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of lower extremity in adult burn patients. Methods: A retrospective case series study was conducted. The clinical data of 3 861 adult burn patients who met the inclusion criteria and were admitted to the Department of Burns of Zhengzhou First People's Hospital from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019 were collected. The patients were divided into DVT group (n=77) and non-DVT group (n=3 784) according to whether DVT of lower extremity occurred during hospitalization or not. Data of patients in the two groups were collected and compared, including the gender, age, total burn area, D-dimer level, with lower limb burn and inhalation injury or not on admission, with sepsis/septic shock, femoral vein indwelling central venous catheter (CVC), history of surgery, and infusion of concentrated red blood cells or not during hospitalization. Data were statistically analyzed with independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-square test. The indicators with statistically significant differences between the two groups were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression analysis to screen the independent risk factors for DVT of lower extremity in 3 861 adult burn patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the independent risk factors predicting DVT of lower extremity in 3 861 adult burn patients were drawn, and the area under the curve (AUC), the optimal threshold value, and the sensitivity and specificity under the optimal threshold value were calculated. The quality of the AUC was compared by Delong test, and the sensitivity and specificity under the optimal threshold value were compared using chi-square test. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in gender, occurrence of sepsis/septic shock or history of surgery during hospitalization between patients in the two groups (P>0.05), while there were statistically significant differences in age, total burn area, D-dimer level, lower limb burn and inhalation injury on admission, and femoral vein indwelling CVC and infusion of concentrated red blood cells during hospitalization between patients in the two groups (t=-8.17, with Z values of -5.04 and -10.83, respectively, Ï2 values of 21.83, 5.37, 7.75, and 4.52, respectively, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, total burn area, and D-dimer level were the independent risk factors for DVT of lower extremity in 3 861 adult burn patients (with odds ratios of 1.05, 1.02, and 1.14, respectively, 95% confidence intervals of 1.04-1.06, 1.00-1.03, and 1.10-1.20, respectively, P<0.05 or P<0.01). The AUCs of ROC of age, total burn area, and D-dimer level for predicting DVT of lower extremity in 3 861 adult burn patients were 0.74, 0.67, and 0.86, respectively (with 95% confidence intervals of 0.68-0.80, 0.60-0.74, and 0.83-0.89, respectively, P values<0.01), the optimal threshold values were 50.5 years old, 10.5% total body surface area, and 1.845 mg/L, respectively, the sensitivity under the optimal threshold values were 71.4%, 70.1%, and 87.0%, respectively, and the specificity under the optimal threshold values were 66.8%, 67.2%, and 72.9%, respectively. The AUC quality and sensitivity and specificity under the optimal threshold value of D-dimer level were significantly better than those of age (z=3.29, with Ï2 values of 284.91 and 34.25, respectively, P<0.01) and total burn area (z=4.98, with Ï2 values of 326.79 and 29.88, respectively, P<0.01), while the AUC quality and sensitivity and specificity under the optimal threshold values were similar between age and total burn area (P>0.05). Conclusions: D-dimer level is an independent risk factor for DVT of lower extremity in adult burn patients, its AUC quality and sensitivity and specificity under the optimal threshold value are better than those of age and total burn area, and it has good predictive value for DVT of lower extremity in adult burn patients.",-1
Clinical and molecular genetic findings of hereditary Parkinson's patients from Turkey,"Introduction:                    The majority of Parkinson's disease (PD) ensue late-onset with a complex spectrum of environmental and genetic risk factors. Awareness of genetic causes in patients with PD is essential for genetic counseling and future genotype-oriented therapeutic developments.              Methods:                    Large pathogenic changes in eight PD-related genes and small pathogenic sequence variants in 22 PD-related genes were investigated simultaneously in 82 PD patients from 79 families where clinical evaluations were performed. The phenotypic characteristics of the patients with molecular changes were examined for genotype-phenotype relations.              Results:                    Pathogenic variants in SNCA, PRKN, DJ-1, FBXO7, and GBA genes were determined in 25 patients from 24 families (24/79, 30%). Associated variants were found in PRKN in 14, SNCA in three, FBXO7 in two, and DJ-1 in one patient. A novel homozygous deletion (c.491delT, p.(V164Dfs*13) (SCV001733595)) leading to protein truncation in the PRKN gene was identified in two patients from the same family. Furthermore, heterozygous GBA gene variants were detected in five patients from different families.              Conclusion:                    It has been shown that the most common cause of genetically transmitted PD is the PRKN gene, while LRRK2 does not play an essential role in this selected population. It has been suggested that even if the autosomal recessive inheritance is expected, genes with autosomal dominant effects such as SNCA should not be overlooked and suggested for investigation. Our study is also the first for evaluating the pathogenic GBA variants' frequency in PD patients from Turkey.",-1
Maintaining Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte infectivity during blood collection and transport for mosquito feeding assays in the field,"Background:                    Mosquito feeding assays using venous blood are commonly used for evaluating the transmission potential of malaria infected individuals. To improve the accuracy of these assays, care must be taken to prevent premature activation or inactivation of gametocytes before they are fed to mosquitoes. This can be challenging in the field where infected individuals and insectary facilities are sometimes very far apart. In this study, a simple, reliable, field applicable method is presented for storage and transport of gametocyte infected blood using a thermos flask.              Methods:                    The optimal storage conditions for maintaining the transmissibility of gametocytes were determined initially using cultured Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in standard membrane feeding assays (SMFAs). The impact of both the internal thermos water temperature (35.5 to 37.8 Â°C), and the external environmental temperature (room temperature to 42 Â°C) during long-term (4 h) storage, and the impact of short-term (15 min) temperature changes (room temp to 40 Â°C) during membrane feeding assays was assessed. The optimal conditions were then evaluated in direct membrane feeding assays (DMFAs) in Burkina Faso and The Gambia where blood from naturally-infected gametocyte carriers was offered to mosquitoes immediately and after storage in thermos flasks.              Results:                    Using cultured gametocytes in SMFAs it was determined that an internal thermos water temperature of 35.5 Â°C and storage of the thermos flask between RT (~ 21.3 Â°C) and 32 Â°C was optimal for maintaining transmissibility of gametocytes for 4 h. Short-term storage of the gametocyte infected blood for 15 min at temperatures up to 40 Â°C (range: RT, 30 Â°C, 38 Â°C and 40 Â°C) did not negatively affect gametocyte infectivity. Using samples from natural gametocyte carriers (47 from Burkina Faso and 16 from The Gambia), the prevalence of infected mosquitoes and the intensity of oocyst infection was maintained when gametocyte infected blood was stored in a thermos flask in water at 35.5 Â°C for up to 4 h.              Conclusions:                    This study determines the optimal long-term (4 h) storage temperature for gametocyte infected blood and the external environment temperature range within which gametocyte infectivity is unaffected. This will improve the accuracy, reproducibility, and utility of DMFAs in the field, and permit reliable comparative assessments of malaria transmission epidemiology in different settings.",-1
Endurance Exercise Prevents Metabolic Distress-induced Senescence in the Hippocampus,"Purpose:                    Metabolic disorder such as obesity and type 2 diabetes caused by excess caloric intake is associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Endurance exercise (EXE) has been suggested to exert neuroprotective effects against the metabolic distress. However, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the exercise-induced neuroprotection have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether EXE-induced neuroprotection is associated with cellular senescence, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress using a mouse model of obesity induced by a high-fat/high-fructose diet.              Methods:                    C57BL/6 female mice (10 wk old) were randomly divided to three groups: normal chow diet group (CON, n = 11), high-fat diet/high-fructose (HFD/HF) group (n = 11), and high-fat diet/high-fructose + endurance exercise (HFD/HF + EXE) group (n = 11). HFD/HF + EXE mice performed treadmill running exercise for 60 minÂ·d, 5 dÂ·wk for 12 wk.              Results:                    Our data showed that EXE ameliorated HFD/HF-induced weight gain, fasting blood glucose levels, and visceral fat gain. More importantly, HFD/HF diet promoted cellular senescence, whereas EXE reversed it, evidenced by a reduction in the levels of p53, p21, p16, beta-galactosidase (SA-Î²-gal), and lipofuscin. Furthermore, EXE prevented HFD/HF-induced neuroinflammation (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-1Î²) by inhibiting toll-like receptor 2 downstream signaling cascades (e.g., tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) in parallel with reduced reactive glial cells. This anti-inflammatory effect of EXE was associated with the reversion of HFD/HF-induced cellular oxidative stress.              Conclusion:                    Our study provides novel evidence that EXE-induced antisenescence against metabolic distress in the hippocampus may be a key neuroprotective mechanism, preventing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.",-1
Impact of deltamethrin-resistance in Aedes albopictus on its fitness cost and vector competence,"Background:                    Aedes albopictus is one of the most invasive species in the world as well as the important vector for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya fever and zika virus disease. Chemical control of mosquitoes is an effective method to control mosquito-borne diseases, however, the wide and improper application of insecticides for vector control has led to serious resistance problems. At present, there have been many reports on the resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in vector mosquitoes including deltamethrin to Aedes albopictus. However, the fitness cost and vector competence of deltamethrin resistant Aedes albopictus remain unknown. To understand the impact of insecticide resistant mosquito is of great significance for the prevention and control mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases.              Methodology/principal findings:                    A laboratory resistant strain (Lab-R) of Aedes albopictus was established by deltamethrin insecticide selecting from the laboratory susceptible strain (Lab-S). The life table between the two strains were comparatively analyzed. The average development time of Lab-R and Lab-S in larvae was 9.7 days and 8.2 days (P < 0.005), and in pupae was 2.0 days and 1.8 days respectively (P > 0.05), indicating that deltamethrin resistance prolongs the larval development time of resistant mosquitoes. The average survival time of resistant adults was significantly shorter than that of susceptible adults, while the body weight of resistant female adults was significantly higher than that of the susceptible females. We also compared the vector competence for dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2) between the two strains via RT-qPCR. Considering the results of infection rate (IR) and virus load, there was no difference between the two strains during the early period of infection (4, 7, 10 day post infection (dpi)). However, in the later period of infection (14 dpi), IR and virus load in heads, salivary glands and ovaries of the resistant mosquitoes were significantly lower than those of the susceptible strain (IR of heads, salivary glands and ovaries: P < 0.05; virus load in heads and salivary glands: P < 0.05; virus load in ovaries: P < 0.001). And then, fourteen days after the DENV-2-infectious blood meal, females of the susceptible and resistant strains were allow to bite 5-day-old suckling mice. Both stains of mosquito can transmit DENV-2 to mice, but the onset of viremia was later in the mice biting by resistant group as well as lower virus copies in serum and brains, suggesting that the horizontal transmission of the resistant strain is lower than the susceptible strain. Meanwhile, we also detected IR of egg pools of the two strains on 14 dpi and found that the resistant strain were less capable of vertical transmission than susceptible mosquitoes. In addition, the average survival time of the resistant females infected with DENV-2 was 16 days, which was the shortest among the four groups of female mosquitoes, suggesting that deltamethrin resistance would shorten the life span of female Aedes albopictus infected with DENV-2.              Conclusions/significance:                    As Aedes albopictus developing high resistance to deltamethrin, the resistance prolonged the growth and development of larvae, shorten the life span of adults, as well as reduced the vector competence of resistant Aedes albopictus for DENV-2. It can be concluded that the resistance to deltamethrin in Aedes albopictus is a double-edged sword, which not only endow the mosquito survive under the pressure of insecticide, but also increase the fitness cost and decrease its vector competence. However, Aedes albopictus resistant to deltamethrin can still complete the external incubation period and transmit dengue virus, which remains a potential vector for dengue virus transmission and becomes a threat to public health. Therefore, we should pay high attention for the problem of insecticide resistance so that to better prevent and control mosquito-borne diseases.",-1
Serum Testosterone Level Within Normal Range Is Positively Associated with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Premenopausal but Not Postmenopausal Women,"Background: A positive relationship between testosterone level and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in women has been reported, but findings concerning the association are conflicting and inconclusive. Materials and Methods: We examined the association between testosterone level and the risk of NAFLD after stratification by menopausal status in 613 women (223 premenopausal women aged 21-52 years and 390 postmenopausal women aged 46-75 years). A diagnosis of fatty liver was based on abdominal ultrasonography. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for NAFLD with 1 nmol/L increment in the log testosterone concentration were calculated after adjusting for confounding variables using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of NAFLD was 19.2% among premenopausal women and 33.3% among postmenopausal women. After adjusting for age, regular exercise, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, mean arterial pressure, fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and testosterone levels, the OR (95% CI) for NAFLD was 2.79 (1.11-7.08) with 1 nmol/L increment of the log testosterone concentration in premenopausal women. However, these positive associations were not found in postmenopausal women after adjusting for the same covariables. Conclusion: Serum testosterone level was positively associated with NAFLD in premenopausal women but not in postmenopausal women. Our findings suggest that higher androgenic activity may be at least partly involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, particularly in premenopausal women.",-1
TRUEE; a bioinformatic pipeline to define the functional microRNA targetome of Arabidopsis,"Central to plant microRNA (miRNA) biology is the identification of functional miRNA-target interactions (MTIs). However, the complementarity basis of bioinformatic target prediction results in mostly false positives, and the degree of complementarity does not equate with regulation. Here, we develop a bioinformatic workflow named TRUEE (Targets Ranked Using Experimental Evidence) that ranks MTIs on the extent to which they are subjected to miRNA-mediated cleavage. It sorts predicted targets into high (HE) and low evidence (LE) groupings based on the frequency and strength of miRNA-guided cleavage degradome signals across multiple degradome experiments. From this, each target is assigned a numerical value, termed a Category Score, ranking the extent to which it is subjected to miRNA-mediated cleavage. As a proof-of-concept, the 428 Arabidopsis miRNAs annotated in miRBase were processed through the TRUEE pipeline to determine the miRNA 'targetome'. The majority of high-ranking Category Score targets corresponded to highly conserved MTIs, validating the workflow. Very few Arabidopsis-specific, Brassicaceae-specific, or Conserved-passenger miRNAs had HE targets with high Category Scores. In total, only several hundred MTIs were found to have Category Scores characteristic of currently known physiologically significance MTIs. Although non-exhaustive, clearly the number of functional MTIs is much narrower than many studies claim. Therefore, using TRUEE to numerically rank targets directly on experimental evidence has given insights into the scope of the functional miRNA targetome of Arabidopsis.",-1
An aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 inhibitor attenuates the metastasis of human colorectal cancer,"Metastasis is the leading cause of death for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The development of therapeutic regimens that selectively inhibit the biological processes involved in CRC cell dissemination is important. We used multiple Affymetrix DNA microarray hybridization datasets to identify genes related to metastasis and have significant prognostic value for patients with CRC. Quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining were used to evaluate mRNA and protein expression. The function of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3) in invasion was assessed by performing transwell assays and animal experiments. Real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assays, and western blotting were used to identify the genes regulated by ALDH1A3. Molecular docking, MTS assays, cellular thermal shift assays, isothermal titration calorimetry, microscale thermophoresis, and enzymatic activity assays were used to screen and verify the efficacy of the ALDH1A3-specific inhibitor YD1701 (dibenzo-30-crown10-ether). Finally, subcutaneous or orthotopic xenograft models were established to investigate the therapeutic potential of YD1701. Human ALDH1A3 was identified to correlate with a metastatic phenotype in CRC cells and a poor patient prognosis. Moreover, ALDH1A3 upregulated the expression of ZEB1 and SNAI2 by inhibiting miR-200 family members. The ALDH1A3-specific inhibitor YD1701 was screened, attenuated the invasion of CRC cells in vitro, and prolonged the survival of mice bearing subcutaneous or orthotopic xenografts. Our results show that ALDH1A3 promotes invasion and metastasis via the miR-200-ZEB1/SANI2 axis and is thus a plausible marker for predicting CRC progression. Inhibiting ALDH1A3 with the identified compound YD1701 might represent an effective therapeutic approach to prevent the metastasis of CRC.",-1
Learning Novel Skills From Iconic Gestures: A Developmental and Evolutionary Perspective,"Cumulative cultural learning has been argued to rely on high-fidelity copying of other individuals' actions. Iconic gestures of actions have no physical effect on objects in the world but merely represent actions that would have an effect. Learning from iconic gestures thus requires paying close attention to the teacher's precise bodily movements-a prerequisite for high-fidelity copying. In three studies, we investigated whether 2- and 3-year-old children (N = 122) and great apes (N = 36) learn novel skills from iconic gestures. When faced with a novel apparatus, participants watched an experimenter perform either an iconic gesture depicting the action necessary to open the apparatus or a gesture depicting a different action. Children, but not great apes, profited from iconic gestures, with older children doing so to a larger extent. These results suggest that high-fidelity copying abilities are firmly in place in humans by at least 3 years of age.",-1
Lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation increases nitric oxide production in taste buds,"Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed when cells are induced or stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines and/or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). iNOS is a downstream gene of the NF-ÎºB pathway. Our previous studies demonstrated that five Nfkb genes are expressed in mouse taste epithelium and taste organoids. However, it is unclear whether activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway could induce iNOS gene expression and increase nitric oxide (NO) production in taste buds. In this study, we investigated the expression of iNOS mRNA and protein after LPS stimulation. Our results showed that a subset of taste bud cells and taste neurons express iNOS proteins after LPS stimulation. In addition, isolated mouse taste epithelium can release NO after exposure to LPS ex vivo. In taste behavioral tests, the NO donor nitroprusside enhanced mouse aversive responses to salty, bitter, and sour taste compounds. The enhanced aversive responses were especially strong for salty taste. In conclusion, our results suggest that iNOS and NO may play a role in the inflammation-associated taste disturbances.",-1
Viability of Glioblastoma Cells and Fibroblasts in the Presence of Imidazole-Containing Compounds,"The naturally occurring dipeptide carnosine (Î²-alanyl-L-histidine) specifically attenuates tumor growth. Here, we ask whether other small imidazole-containing compounds also affect the viability of tumor cells without affecting non-malignant cells and whether the formation of histamine is involved. Patient-derived fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells were treated with carnosine, L-alanyl-L-histidine (LA-LH), Î²-alanyl-L-alanine, L-histidine, histamine, imidazole, Î²-alanine, and L-alanine. Cell viability was assessed by cell-based assays and microscopy. The intracellular release of L-histidine and formation of histamine was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Carnosine and LA-LH inhibited tumor cell growth with minor effects on fibroblasts, and L-histidine, histamine, and imidazole affected viability in both cell types. Compounds without the imidazole moiety did not diminish viability. In the presence of LA-LH but not in the presence of carnosine, a significant rise in intracellular amounts of histidine was detected in all cells. The formation of histamine was not detectable in the presence of carnosine, LA-LH, or histidine. In conclusion, the imidazole moiety of carnosine contributes to its anti-neoplastic effect, which is also seen in the presence of histidine and LA-LH. Despite the fact that histamine has a strong effect on cell viability, the formation of histamine is not responsible for the effects on the cell viability of carnosine, LA-LH, and histidine.",-1
Fat metabolism and acute resistance exercise in trained women,"This study investigated the effect of acute full-body resistance exercise [RE; one set of 10 repetitions at 40% 1 repetition maximum (1RM) and three sets of 10 repetitions at 65% 1RM] on subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SCAAT) lipolysis and whole body substrate oxidation in young (age: 22 Â± 1 yr), normal-weight and body fatness (body mass index: 20 Â± 1 kg/m2; %body fat: 28.7 Â± 1.4%), resistance-trained women. Microdialysis was used to measure SCAAT lipolysis at baseline, mid-RE, post-RE, and 30 min post-RE, and indirect calorimetry was used to measure whole body substrate oxidation at baseline and immediately post-RE in 13 women. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glycerol, growth hormone (GH), epinephrine (Epi), and norepinephrine (NE) were measured at baseline, mid-RE, and post-RE. Lipolysis (dialysate glycerol concentration) was elevated post-RE (baseline: 596.7 Â± 82.8, post-RE: 961.4 Â± 116.3 ÂµM, P = 0.01). Energy expenditure (baseline: 1,560 Â± 49; post-RE: 1,756 Â± 68 kcal/day; P = 0.02) and fat oxidation (baseline: 5.64 Â± 0.24; post-RE: 7.57 Â± 0.41 g/h; P = 0.0003) were elevated post-RE. GH (baseline: 513.1 Â± 147.4; mid-RE: 1,288.3 Â± 83.9; post-RE: 1,522.8 Â± 51.1 pg/ml, P = 0.000), Epi (baseline: 23.2 Â± 2.7; mid-RE: 92.5 Â± 16.6; post-RE: 84.5 Â± 21.4 pg/ml, P = 0.000), and NE (baseline: 139.2 Â± 13.6; mid-RE: 850.9 Â± 155.3; post-RE: 695.3 Â± 93.5 pg/ml, P = 0.000) were higher at mid-RE and post-RE. Therefore, one of the potential mechanisms behind RE-induced fat mass changes in resistance-trained women may be in part due to the accumulated effect of transient increases in SCAAT lipolysis, fat oxidation, and energy expenditure, mediated by GH, Epi, and NE release.",-1
Time-restricted feeding alleviates cardiac dysfunction induced by simulated microgravity via restoring cardiac FGF21 signaling,"Dietary restriction has been well-described to improve health metrics, but whether it could benefit pathophysiological adaptation to extreme environment, for example, microgravity, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of a daily rhythm of fasting and feeding without reducing caloric intake on cardiac function and metabolism against simulated microgravity. Male rats under ad libitum feeding or time-restricted feeding (TRF; food access limited to 8 hours every day) were subjected to hindlimb unloading (HU) to simulate microgravity. HU for 6 weeks led to left ventricular dyssynchrony and declined cardiac function. HU also lowered pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and impaired glucose utilization in the heart. All these were largely preserved by TRF. TRF showed no effects on HU-induced loss of cardiac mass, but significantly improved contractile function of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, TRF raised liver-derived fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) level and enhanced cardiac FGF21 signaling as manifested by upregulation of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) expression and its downstream markers in HU rats. In isolated cardiomyocytes, FGF21 treatment improved PDH activity and glucose utilization, consequently enhancing cell contractile function. Finally, both liver-specific knockdown (KD) of FGF21 and cardiac-specific FGFR1 KD abrogated the cardioprotective effects of TRF in HU rats. These data demonstrate that TRF improves cardiac glucose utilization and ameliorates cardiac dysfunction induced by simulated microgravity, at least partially, through restoring cardiac FGF21 signaling, suggesting TRF as a potential countermeasure for cardioprotection in long-term spaceflight.",-1
Pathogenesis and shedding of Usutu virus in juvenile chickens,"Usutu virus (USUV; family: Flaviviridae, genus: Flavivirus), is an emerging zoonotic arbovirus that causes severe neuroinvasive disease in humans and has been implicated in the loss of breeding bird populations in Europe. USUV is maintained in an enzootic cycle between ornithophilic mosquitos and wild birds. As a member of the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex, USUV is closely related to West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), both neuroinvasive arboviruses endemic in wild bird populations in the United States. An avian model for USUV is essential to understanding zoonotic transmission. Here we describe the first avian models of USUV infection with the development of viremia. Juvenile commercial ISA Brown chickens were susceptible to infection by multiple USUV strains with evidence of cardiac lesions. Juvenile chickens from two chicken lines selected for high (HAS) or low (LAS) antibody production against sheep red blood cells showed markedly different responses to USUV infection. Morbidity and mortality were observed in the LAS chickens, but not HAS chickens. LAS chickens had significantly higher viral titers in blood and other tissues, as well as oral secretions, and significantly lower development of neutralizing antibody responses compared to HAS chickens. Mathematical modelling of virus-host interactions showed that the viral clearance rate is a stronger mitigating factor for USUV viremia than neutralizing antibody response in this avian model. These chicken models provide a tool for further understanding USUV pathogenesis in birds and evaluating transmission dynamics between avian hosts and mosquito vectors.",-1
Systematic Review of the Common Pathophysiological Mechanisms in COVID-19 and Neurodegeneration: The Role of Bioactive Compounds and Natural Antioxidants,"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoVCOVID-19) belongs to the Beta coronavirus family, which contains MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus). SARS-CoV-2 activates the innate immune system, thereby activating the inflammatory mechanism, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, it has been suggested that COVID-19 may penetrate the central nervous system, and release inflammatory cytokines in the brains, inducing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Several links connect COVID-19 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as elevated oxidative stress, uncontrolled release of the inflammatory cytokines, and mitochondrial apoptosis. There are severe concerns that excessive immune cell activation in COVID-19 may aggravate the neurodegeneration and amyloid-beta pathology of AD. Here, we have collected the evidence, showing the links between the two diseases. The focus has been made to collect the information on the activation of the inflammation, its contributors, and shared therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we have given future perspectives, research gaps, and overlapping pathological bases of the two diseases. Lastly, we have given the short touch to the drugs that have equally shown rescuing effects against both diseases. Although there is limited information available regarding the exact links between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation, we have insight into the pathological contributors of the diseases. Based on the shared pathological features and therapeutic targets, we hypothesize that the activation of the immune system may induce neurological disorders by triggering oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.",-1
Alterations of host-gut microbiome interactions in multiple sclerosis,"Background:                    Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a complex genetic, immune and metabolic pathophysiology. Recent studies implicated the gut microbiome in MS pathogenesis. However, interactions between the microbiome and host immune system, metabolism and diet have not been studied over time in this disorder.              Methods:                    We performed a six-month longitudinal multi-omics study of 49 participants (24 untreated relapse remitting MS patients and 25 age, sex, race matched healthy control individuals. Gut microbiome composition and function were characterized using 16S and metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Flow cytometry was used to characterize blood immune cell populations and cytokine profiles. Circulating metabolites were profiled by untargeted UPLC-MS. A four-day food diary was recorded to capture the habitual dietary pattern of study participants.              Findings:                    Together with changes in blood immune cells, metagenomic analysis identified a number of gut microbiota decreased in MS patients compared to healthy controls, and microbiota positively or negatively correlated with degree of disability in MS patients. MS patients demonstrated perturbations of their blood metabolome, such as linoleate metabolic pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, chalcone, dihydrochalcone, 4-nitrocatechol and methionine. Global correlations between multi-omics demonstrated a disrupted immune-microbiome relationship and a positive blood metabolome-microbiome correlation in MS. Specific feature association analysis identified a potential correlation network linking meat servings with decreased gut microbe B. thetaiotaomicron, increased Th17 cell and greater abundance of meat-associated blood metabolites. The microbiome and metabolome profiles remained stable over six months in MS and control individuals.              Interpretation:                    Our study identified multi-system alterations in gut microbiota, immune and blood metabolome of MS patients at global and individual feature level. Multi-OMICS data integration deciphered a potential important biological network that links meat intakes with increased meat-associated blood metabolite, decreased polysaccharides digesting bacteria, and increased circulating proinflammatory marker.

Meteorological patterns and the evolution of West Nile virus in an environmentally stressed Mediterranean area,"The present work investigates the increase of confirmed cases of West Nile virus and the relationship between weather-related patterns and the geographical expansion of West Nile virus in Greece, with a special focus on West Attica, Central Greece, a semi-arid, ecologically fragile Mediterranean area. Using data from the European Environment Agency, European Drought Observatory of Joint Research Centre, the pairwise relationship between surface air temperature anomalies, precipitation anomalies, soil moisture index anomalies, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation anomalies (fAPAR) was evaluated during summer time of 2018, a particularly intense virus outbreak. The empirical results of this study indicate that total precipitation during 2018 was extremely high, nearly 500% above the average. These conditions contributed to the increase of soil moisture index anomaly and fAPAR, creating an ideal microenvironment (wet soils and green pastures) for mosquito breeding. This phenomenon was directly associated with a drastic outbreak of West Nile virus cases in the area, compared with earlier years. Our results indicate how unusually high values of summer precipitation may have contributed (both through direct and indirect ecological channels) to the rapid spread of the West Nile virus in West Attica, causing a significant number of confirmed cases and fatalities. Climate change may bring forth other issues aside from natural disasters, including-but not limited to-virus expansion.",-1
"3,5-Diiodo-L-Thyronine Exerts Metabolically Favorable Effects on Visceral Adipose Tissue of Rats Receiving a High-Fat Diet","When administered to rats receiving a high-fat diet (HFD), 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (3,5-T2) [at a dose of 25 Î¼g/100 g body weight (BW)] is known to increase energy expenditure and to prevent HFD-induced adiposity. Here, we investigated which cellular and molecular processes in visceral white adipose tissue (VAT) contributed to the beneficial effect of 3,5-T2 over time (between 1 day and 4 weeks following administration). 3,5-T2 programmed the adipocyte for lipolysis by rapidly inducing hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) phosphorylation at the protein kinase A-responsive site Ser563, accompanied with glycerol release at the 1-week time-point, contributing to the partial normalization of adipocyte volume with respect to control (N) animals. After two weeks, when the adipocyte volumes of HFD-3,5-T2 rats were completely normalized to those of the controls (N), 3,5-T2 consistently induced HSL phosphorylation at Ser563, indicative of a combined effect of 3,5-T2-induced adipose lipolysis and increasing non-adipose oxidative metabolism. VAT proteome analysis after 4 weeks of treatment revealed that 3,5-T2 significantly altered the proteomic profile of HFD rats and produced a marked pro-angiogenic action. This was associated with a reduced representation of proteins involved in lipid storage or related to response to oxidative stress, and a normalization of the levels of those involved in lipogenesis-associated mitochondrial function. In conclusion, the prevention of VAT mass-gain by 3,5-T2 occurred through different molecular pathways that, together with the previously reported stimulation of resting metabolism and liver fatty acid oxidation, are associated with an anti adipogenic/lipogenic potential and positively impact on tissue health.",-1
Association between Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotype and diabetes mellitus/hypertension: a molecular study,"Background:                    A paucity of studies focused on the genetic association that tuberculosis (TB) patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are more likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) with more potent virulence on anti-TB drug resistance than those without NCDs. The study aimed to document the predominant genotype, determine the association between MTB genotypes and NCD status and drug resistance.              Methods:                    We conducted a molecular study in 105 TB patients based on a cross-sectional study focused on the comorbid relationship between chronic conditions and TB among 1773 subjects from September 1, 2019 to August 30, 2020 in Guizhou, China. The participants were investigated through face-to-face interviews, followed by NCDs screening. The DNA of MTB isolates was extracted prior to genotyping using 24 loci MIRU-VNTR. The subsequent evaluations were performed by phylogenetic trees, combined with tests of statistical power, Chi-square or Fisher and multivariate logistic regression analysis.              Results:                    The Beijing family of Lineage 2 (East Asia) was the predominant genotype accounting for 43.8% (46/105), followed by Lineage 4 (Euro-America) strains, including Uganda I (34.3%, 36/105), and the NEW-1 (9.5%, 10/105). The proportion of Beijing strain in patients with and without NCDS was 28.6% (8/28) and 49.4% (38/77), respectively, with a statistical power test value of 24.3%. No significant association was detected between MTB genotype and NCD status. A low clustering rate (2.9%) was identified, consisting of two clusters. The rates of global, mono-, poly- and multi-drug resistance were 16.2% (17/105), 14.3% (15/105), 1.0% (1/105) and 4.8% (5/105), respectively. The drug-resistant rates of rifampicin, isoniazid, and streptomycin, were 6.7% (7/105), 11.4% (12/105) and 5.7% (6/105), respectively. Isoniazid resistance was significantly associated with the Beijing genotype of Lineage 2 (19.6% versus 5.1%).              Conclusions:                    The Lineage 2 East Asia/Beijing genotype is the dominant genotype of the local MTB with endogenous infection preponderating. Not enough evidence is detected to support the association between the MTB genotype and diabetes/hypertension. Isoniazid resistance is associated with the Lineage 2 East Asia/Beijing strain.",-1
The self-defining period in autobiographical memory: Evidence from a long-running radio show,"This study is the first to demonstrate that a self-defining period (SP) for personally relevant music emerges spontaneously in a public naturalistic setting. While previous research has demonstrated that people tend to have better memory and preference for songs from their teenage years, the theoretical relevance of these studies has been limited by their reliance on forced-choice methodology and a confinement to contemporary popular Western music. Here, we examine the record choices of famous guests (n = 80; mean age = 61.6 years) interviewed for Desert Island Discs, a long-running popular radio programme on BBC Radio 4. Half of all choices were shown to have been most important between the ages of 10 and 30 years, and the most popular reason for their relevance was the song's link to memories of a person, period, or place. We suggest that music is a defining feature of the SP, intrinsically connected to the developing self.",-1
Validity of Visceral Fat Area Measurement by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis in Japanese Obese Individuals,"Introduction:                    Obesity management is a critical global issue. It is essential to evaluate visceral adiposity which is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.              Aim:                    This study aims at precisely evaluating the necessity of visceral adipose tissue in obesity management.              Methods:                    We assessed the validity of visceral fat area (VFA) measurement using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with computed tomography (CT) as a reference in obese subjects. Although VFABIA exhibited significant correlation with VFACT, the difference between VFACT and VFABIA increased with an advancing degree of obesity.              Result and conclusion:                    The BIA device seemingly underestimated VFA in obese subjects compared with the normal-weight subjects.",-1
Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes in response to brassinolide treatment on flowering of tree peony ( Paeonia ostii),"Tree peony is a famous flower plant in China, but the short and concentrated flowering period limits its ornamental value and economic value. Brassinolide (BR) plays an important role in plant growth and development including flowering. There have been a large number of reports on the molecular aspects of the flowering process, but the genetic mechanism that was responsible for miRNA-guided regulation of tree peony is almost unclear. In this study, the leaves of tree peony cultivar, 'Feng Dan', were sprayed with different concentrations of BR, and the obvious bloom delay was found at the treatment with BR 50 Î¼g/L. The small RNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing were performed on the petals of tree peony under an untreated control (CK) and the treatment with BR 50 Î¼g/L during four consecutive flowering development stages. A total of 22 known miRNAs belonging to 12 families were identified and 84 novel miRNAs were predicted. Combined with transcriptome data, a total of 376 target genes were predicted for the 18 differentially expressed known miRNAs and 177 target genes were predicted for the 23 differentially expressed novel miRNAs. Additionally, the potential miRNAs and their target genes were identified, including miR156b targeting SPL, miR172a_4 targeting AP2 and four novel miRNAs targeting SPA1, and revealed that they might affect the flowering time in tree peony. Collectively, these results would provide a theoretical basis for further analysis of miRNA-guided regulation on flowering period in tree peony.",-1
Potential for online crowdsourced biological recording data to complement surveillance for arthropod vectors,"Voluntary contributions by citizen scientists can gather large datasets covering wide geographical areas, and are increasingly utilized by researchers for multiple applications, including arthropod vector surveillance. Online platforms such as iNaturalist accumulate crowdsourced biological observations from around the world and these data could also be useful for monitoring vectors. The aim of this study was to explore the availability of observations of important vector taxa on the iNaturalist platform and examine the utility of these data to complement existing vector surveillance activities. Of ten vector taxa investigated, records were most numerous for mosquitoes (Culicidae; 23,018 records, 222 species) and ticks (Ixodida; 16,214 records, 87 species), with most data from 2019-2020. Case studies were performed to assess whether images associated with records were of sufficient quality to identify species and compare iNaturalist observations of vector species to the known situation at the state, national and regional level based on existing published data. Firstly, tick data collected at the national (United Kingdom) or state (Minnesota, USA) level were sufficient to determine seasonal occurrence and distribution patterns of important tick species, and were able to corroborate and complement known trends in tick distribution. Importantly, tick species with expanding distributions (Haemaphysalis punctata in the UK, and Amblyomma americanum in Minnesota) were also detected. Secondly, using iNaturalist data to monitor expanding tick species in Europe (Hyalomma spp.) and the USA (Haemaphysalis longicornis), and invasive Aedes mosquitoes in Europe, showed potential for tracking these species within their known range as well as identifying possible areas of expansion. Despite known limitations associated with crowdsourced data, this study shows that iNaturalist can be a valuable source of information on vector distribution and seasonality that could be used to supplement existing vector surveillance data, especially at a time when many surveillance programs may have been interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions.",-1
Sex differences in the effect of acute fasting on excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons,"Key points:                    Fasting can increase motivation for food and can energize reward-seeking. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons respond to motivationally relevant information and fasting can influence mesolimbic dopamine concentration. An acute overnight fast differentially alters food approach behaviours and excitatory synaptic transmission onto VTA dopamine neurons of male or female mice. While inhibitory synapses onto VTA dopamine neurons are not altered by fasting in male or female mice, male mice had strengthened excitatory synapses whereas female mice had increased endocannabinoid-mediated short-term plasticity at excitatory synapses. These results help us understand how fasting differentially influences excitatory synaptic transmission onto dopamine neurons and may inform different strategies for fasting-induced food seeking by male and female mice.              Abstract:                    Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are important for energizing goal-directed behaviour towards food and are sensitive to changes in metabolic states. Fasting increases the incentive motivation for food and the mobilization of energy stores and has sex-dependent effects. However, it is unknown how acute fasting alters excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission onto VTA dopamine neurons. An acute 16 h overnight fast induced increased food-seeking behaviour that was more predominant in male mice. Fasting increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency and amplitude in male, but not female, mice. This effect was not due to altered release probability as there was no change in the paired pulse ratio, nor was it due to an altered postsynaptic response as there was no change in the AMPA receptor/NMDA receptor ratio or response to glutamate uncaging. However, this effect was consistent with an increase in the number of release sites. In addition, depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, a measure of short-term endocannabinoid-mediated plasticity, was enhanced in female but not male fasted mice. There were no fasting-induced changes at inhibitory synapses onto dopamine neurons of male or female mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that fasting influences excitatory synapses differentially in male and female mice, but preserves inhibitory synapses onto dopamine neurons, indicating that the mesolimbic circuits of male and female mice respond differently to acute energy deprivation.",-1
"Exploring the utility of social-ecological and entomological risk factors for dengue infection as surveillance indicators in the dengue hyper-endemic city of Machala, Ecuador","The management of mosquito-borne diseases is a challenge in southern coastal Ecuador, where dengue is hyper-endemic and co-circulates with other arboviral diseases. Prior work in the region has explored social-ecological factors, dengue case data, and entomological indices. In this study, we bring together entomological and epidemiological data to describe links between social-ecological factors associated with risk of dengue transmission at the household level in Machala, Ecuador. Households surveys were conducted from 2014-2017 to assess the presence of adult Aedes aegypti (collected via aspiration) and to enumerate housing conditions, demographics, and mosquito prevention behaviors. Household-level dengue infection status was determined by laboratory diagnostics in 2014-2015. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify social-ecological variables associated with household presence of female Ae. aegypti and household dengue infection status, respectively. Aedes aegypti presence was associated with interruptions in water service and weekly trash collection, and household air conditioning was protective against mosquito presence. Presence of female Ae. aegypti was not associated with household dengue infections. We identified shaded patios and head of household employment status as risk factors for household-level dengue infection, while window screening in good condition was identified as protective against dengue infection. These findings add to our understanding of the systems of mosquito-borne disease transmission in Machala, and in the larger region of southern Ecuador, aiding in the development of improved vector surveillance efforts, and targeted interventions.",-1
The gut virome in two indigenous populations from Malaysia,"The human gut contains a complex microbiota dominated by bacteriophages but also containing other viruses and bacteria and fungi. There are a growing number of techniques for the extraction, sequencing, and analysis of the virome but currently no standardized protocols. This study established an effective workflow for virome analysis to investigate the virome of stool samples from two understudied ethnic groups from Malaysia: the Jakun and Jehai Orang Asli. By using the virome extraction and analysis workflow with the Oxford Nanopore Technology, long-read sequencing successfully captured close to full-length viral genomes. The virome composition of the two indigenous Malaysian communities were remarkably different from those found in other parts of the world. Additionally, plant viruses found in the viromes of these individuals were attributed to traditional food-seeking methods. This study establishes a human gut virome workflow and extends insights into the healthy human gut virome, laying the groundwork for comparative studies.",-1
"Gait characteristics under single-/dual-task walking conditions in elderly patients with cerebral small vessel disease: Analysis of gait variability, gait asymmetry and bilateral coordination of gait","Background:                    Dual-task walking (DTW) is common in daily life and represents an ideal paradigm for elucidating gait irregularity. Under single-task walking (STW) and DTW conditions, the symmetric and bilaterally coordinated human gait pattern found in healthy individuals is absent in individuals with neurological ailments such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and post-stroke issues. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a neuropathological and radiological issue that has been reported to be associated with cognitive and motor disorders. However, few gait analyses have focused on elderly individuals with CSVD under DTW conditions.              Research question:                    Are parameters of gait analysis helpful in elucidating gait abnormalities in elderly patients with CSVD under DTW conditions?              Methods:                    A total of 46 elderly patients with CSVD (CSVD group) and 22 healthy, age-matched individuals (HE group) were recruited. Gait data were collected from both groups under STW and DTW conditions. Direct parameters and metrics reflecting gait variability, gait asymmetry, and bilateral coordination of gait in the two groups were compared.              Results:                    Under STW conditions, elderly individuals with CSVD showed markedly shorter stride length, were slower, and had higher gait asymmetry (GA) and phase coordination index (PCI) than healthy controls after adjusting for age, sex and level of education. Under DTW conditions, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups in stride time, stride length, cadence, stride time variability, GA and PCI after adjusting for age, sex, and level of education.              Significance:                    Reanalysis-generated parameters, such as gait variability, GA, and PCI, are biomarkers for gait dysfunction in elderly patients with CSVD. In this study, elderly individuals with CVSD showed abnormal gait features under both STW and DTW conditions.",-1
Impact of adrenomedullin blockage on lipid metabolism in female mice exposed to high-fat diet,"Purpose:                    Adrenomedullin (ADM) levels are elevated in gestational and type 2 diabetic patients. ADM also stimulates lipolysis in vitro. Disturbed lipid metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Here, we explore whether blockade of ADM is beneficial for metabolic homeostasis in a diabetic mouse model.              Methods:                    C57BL/6J female mice were placed on either a control or a high fat high sucrose (HFHS) diet for 8 weeks. At week 4, osmotic mini-pumps were implanted for constant infusion of either saline or ADM antagonist, ADM22-52. Glucose tolerance tests were performed prior to infusion and 4 weeks after infusion began. Animals were then sacrificed and visceral adipose tissue collected for further analysis.              Results:                    Mice fed HFHS displayed glucose intolerance, increased mRNA expressions in VAT for Adm and its receptor components, Crlr. HFHS fed mice also had increased basal and isoprenaline-induced glycerol release by VAT explants. ADM22-52 did not significantly affect glucose intolerance. ADM22-52 did suppress basal and isoprenaline-induced glycerol release by VAT explants. This alteration was associated with enhanced mRNA expression of insulin signaling factors Insr and Glut4, and adipogenic factor Pck1.              Conclusions:                    HFHS diet induces glucose intolerance and enhances ADM and its receptor expressions in VAT in female mice. ADM22-52 treatment did not affect glucose intolerance in HFHS mice, but reduced both basal and isoprenaline-induced lipolysis, which is associated with enhanced expression of genes involved in adipogenesis. These results warrant further research on the effects of ADM blockade in improving lipid homeostasis in diabetic patients.",-1
Ramadan Intermittent Fasting Affects Adipokines and Leptin/Adiponectin Ratio in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Their First-Degree Relatives,"Background:                    In view of the association of Ramadan intermittent fasting with profound changes in lifestyle both in nondiabetic and diabetic patients, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Ramadan fasting on adiponectin, leptin and leptin to adiponectin ratio (LAR), growth hormone (GH), human-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and diabetic and metabolic syndrome factors in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2 DM), their first-degree relatives (FDRs), and healthy controls.              Methods:                    This cohort study involved 98 Yemeni male subjects aged 30-70 years old: 30 Type 2 DM, 37 FDRs of Type 2 diabetic patients, and 31 healthy control subjects. Subjects' body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure (BP) were measured, and venous blood samples were collected twice: the first samples were collected a couple of days prior to Ramadan fasting (baseline) and the second samples after 3 weeks of fasting.              Results:                    Ramadan fasting did not affect BMI, WC, and BP in Type 2 DM and their FDRs with respect to the baseline levels prior to Ramadan, whereas triglyceride and cholesterol were borderline significantly decreased in Type 2 DM with no effect in FDRs. Fasting blood glucose was not affected in Type 2 DM but was significantly increased in FDRs and control groups, whereas glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was slightly decreased in Type 2 DM, FDRs, and healthy controls. C-peptide, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly increased in Type 2 DM and FDRs, with no effect in the control group, whereas Î²-cell function (HOMA-Î²) was significantly decreased in FDRs and controls with no change in Type 2 DM. Ramadan fasting significantly decreased GH in both FDRs and control groups, and significantly increased hs-CRP in the control with no effect in Type 2 DM and FDRs. Adiponectin was significantly decreased, and leptin and LAR were significantly increased in Type 2 DM, FDRs, and control groups.              Conclusion:                    Ramadan intermittent fasting decreased adiponectin and increased leptin, LAR, insulin, and insulin resistance in both Type 2 DM and FDRs as well as decreased GH in both FDRs and healthy controls and increased hs-CRP in healthy controls. Moreover, Ramadan intermittent fasting neither worsens a patient's glycemic parameters nor improves it, with the exception of a slight improvement in HbA1c in Type 2 DM, FDRs, and healthy controls.",-1
Dietary intake of magnesium in a type 1 diabetic pediatric population,"Several studies suggest the importance of adequate magnesium intake in the prevention of diabetes and/or its complications. The main objective of this study is to determine the daily dietary intake of magnesium in type 1 Algerian pediatric diabetics. The study involved a pediatric population of 201 individuals aged from 3 to 17 years, including 96 type 1 diabetics and 105 controls. The daily dietary intake of magnesium was determined by the 24-hour recall. The correlation between the intake of magnesium and glycemic control has been assessed in diabetics. The odds ratio was used to study the relationship between dietary magnesium intake and diabetes through multinomial logistic regression. The results indicate that there are 84% of diabetics with low magnesium intake compared to 61% of controls (P = 0.001). A negative but no significant correlation was found between magnesium intake, glycemia, and HbA1c. The multinomial logistic regression model showed that daily dietary magnesium intakes, lower than EFSA adequate intake, are associated with an OR of 5.50 (1.92-15.74; P = 0.002) in adjusted model for age, sex, and BMI. It is necessary to correct the low dietary intake of magnesium by changing the eating habits of the pediatric populations in western Algeria and more particularly type 1 diabetics.",-1
"Letter to the editor, ""High intensity aerobic exercise improves bimanual coordination of grasping forces in Parkinson's disease""","We have read with utmost interest the article entitled, ""High intensity aerobic exercise improves bimanual coordination of grasping forces in Parkinson's disease"" by Jansen et al. They have highlighted the importance and feasibility of providing high intensity aerobic exercise on improving the bimanual coordination of grasping forces for the patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Prediction of COMT Inhibitors Using Machine Learning and Molecular Dynamics Methods,"Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays a vital role in deactivating neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, etc., by methylating those compounds. However, the deactivation of an excess amount of neurotransmitters leads to serious mental ailments such as Parkinson's disease. Molecules that bind inside the enzyme's active site inhibit this methylation mechanism by methylating themselves, termed COMT inhibitors. Our study is focused on designing these inhibitors by various machine learning methods. First, we have developed a classification model with experimentally available COMT inhibitors, which helped us generate a new data set of small inhibitor-like molecules. Then, to predict the activity of the new molecules, we have applied regression techniques such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and support vector machines. Each of the regression models yielded an R2 value > 70% for both training and test data sets. Finally, to validate our models, 200 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the two known inhibitors with known IC50 values and the resultant inhibitors were performed inside the binding pockets to check their stability within. The free energy barrier of the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to each inhibitor was determined by combining steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and umbrella sampling using the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method.",-1
"Interventions Within the Scope of Occupational Therapy to Improve Activities of Daily Living, Rest, and Sleep in People With Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review","Importance:                    People with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly experience difficulty in performing activities of daily living (ADLs), which affects their perceived quality of life.              Objective:                    To examine the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy to improve performance and participation in ADLs, rest, and sleep in adults with PD.              Data sources:                    Databases searched were MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, OTseeker, and Cochrane Collection. Included articles were published between January 2011 and December 2018. Study Selection and Data Collection: Articles describing Level 1b, 2b, and 3b studies that examined outcomes related to ADLs, rest, and sleep in people with PD were included following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.              Findings:                    Forty-five articles (10 Level 1b, 27 Level 2b, and 8 Level 3b) met the inclusion criteria.              Conclusions and relevance:                    Strong strength of evidence was found to support inpatient multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment (MIRT) to improve ADLs, and moderate strength of evidence that MIRT improves sleep performance. Low strength of evidence was present for outpatient occupational therapy to improve ADL and sleep outcomes. Low strength of evidence was found for resistance exercise programs to improve ADLs, but moderate strength of evidence indicates that multimodal exercise programs and targeted exercise programs can improve ADLs. Low to moderate strength of evidence suggested that alternative therapies and cognitive-behavioral therapy have a positive impact on ADLs and sleep. These results can be used to inform evidence-based occupational therapy practice. What This Article Adds: This article provides information for practitioners on the effectiveness of interventions within the scope of occupational therapy practice to improve ADLs and sleep.",-1
Global MicroRNA Expression Profiling of Buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis) Embryos at Different Developmental Stages Produced by Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer and In-Vitro Fertilization Using RNA Sequencing,"Despite the success of cloning technology in the production of offspring across several species, its application on a wide scale is severely limited by the very low offspring rate obtained with cloned embryos. The expression profile of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cloned embryos throughout embryonic development is reported to deviate from regular patterns. The present study is aimed at determining the dynamics of the global expression of miRNA profile in cloned and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) pre-implantation embryos at different developmental stages, i.e., the two-cell, eight-cell, and blastocyst stages, using next-generation sequencing. The results of this study suggest that there is a profound difference in global miRNA profile between cloned and IVF embryos. These differences are manifested throughout the course of embryonic development. The cloned embryos differ from their IVF counterparts in enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms of biological process, molecular function, cellular component, and protein class categories in terms of the targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. The major pathways related to embryonic development, such as the Wnt signaling pathway, the apoptosis signaling pathway, the FGF signaling pathway, the p53 pathway, etc., were found to be affected in cloned relative to IVF embryos. Overall, these data reveal the distinct miRNA profile of cloned relative to IVF embryos, suggesting that the molecules or pathways affected may play an important role in cloned embryo development.",-1
The effectiveness of a structured group education programme for people with established type 2 diabetes in a multi-ethnic population in primary care: A cluster randomised trial,"Background and aims:                    Structured self-management education has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) but more research is needed to look at culturally appropriate programmes in ethnic minority groups, where prevalence of T2DM is higher and diagnosis earlier. The study tested the effectiveness of a group education programme for people with established T2DM in a multi-ethnic primary care population.              Methods and results:                    Cluster randomised trial conducted in two multi-ethnic UK sites. Practices were randomised (1:1) to a structured T2DM group education programme or to continue with routine care. A culturally-adapted version was offered to South Asians, who formed the majority of ethnic minority participants. Other ethnic minority groups were invited to attend the standard programme. Primary outcome was change in HbA1c at 12 months. All analyses accounted for clustering and baseline value.367 participants (64(SD 10.8) years, 36% women, 34% from minority ethnic groups) were recruited from 31 clusters. At 12 months, there was no difference in mean change in HbA1c between the two groups (-0.10%; (95% CI: -0.37, 0.17). Subgroup analyses suggested the intervention was effective at lowering HbA1c in White European compared with ethnic minority groups. The intervention group lost more body weight than the control group (-0.82 kg at 6 months and -1.06 kg at 12 months; both p = 0.03).              Conclusion:                    Overall, the programme did not result in HbA1c improvement but in subgroup analysis, a beneficial effect occurred in White Europeans. Findings emphasise a need to develop and evaluate culturally-relevant programmes for ethnic minority groups.",-1
Using Graphene-Based Biosensors to Detect Dopamine for Efficient Parkinson's Disease Diagnostics,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) depletes due to the progressive loss of nigrostriatal neurons. Therefore, DA measurement might be a useful diagnostic tool for targeting the early stages of PD, as well as helping to optimize DA replacement therapy. Moreover, DA sensing appears to be a useful analytical tool in complex biological systems in PD studies. To support the feasibility of this concept, this mini-review explores the currently developed graphene-based biosensors dedicated to DA detection. We discuss various graphene modifications designed for high-performance DA sensing electrodes alongside their analytical performances and interference studies, which we listed based on their limit of detection in biological samples. Moreover, graphene-based biosensors for optical DA detection are also presented herein. Regarding clinical relevance, we explored the development trends of graphene-based electrochemical sensing of DA as they relate to point-of-care testing suitable for the site-of-location diagnostics needed for personalized PD management. In this field, the biosensors are developed into smartphone-connected systems for intelligent disease management. However, we highlighted that the focus should be on the clinical utility rather than analytical and technical performance.",-1
Analysis of Psychological Changes and Intervention Mechanism of Elderly Groups Based on Deep Learning Analysis Technology,"The elderly group is a unique social phenomenon in China. This study analyzes the typology of psychological changes in the elderly group based on the analysis of deep learning techniques and also combines crisis intervention theory to study the intervention strategies of social workers in different stages of emotional changes in the elderly group. A questionnaire survey of the elderly was conducted using the survey method, in which 10,948 valid questionnaires were screened from the Psychological Condition Self-check Scale and 11,040 valid questionnaires were screened from the Mental Health Survey Questionnaire for the Elderly. The degree of negative emotions of the elderly group in public emergencies was not related to age, but significantly correlated with age (p value < 0.05), and there was a tendency that the higher the age, the deeper the degree; in addition, elderly people of different professions also showed significant differences (p < 0.05); elderly people of different regions also showed significant differences (p < 0.05). In crisis intervention, social workers mainly provide services such as initial diagnosis, primary intervention, secondary intervention, and assessment for the caseworkers. The practical study found that social workers need to use strategies such as short-term focal solutions, avoiding guiding clients with their own values; crisis intervention programmes should be flexible, proactively helping clients to rebuild their support network, developing clients' self-solving skills, and implementing interprofessional teamwork and whole-person rehabilitation services.",-1
Pulmonary emphysema quantification at low dose chest CT using Deep Learning image reconstruction,"Purpose:                    Quantitative analysis of emphysema volume is affected by the radiation dose and the CT reconstruction technique. We aim to evaluate the influence of a commercially available deep learning image reconstruction algorithm (DLIR) on the quantification of pulmonary emphysema in low-dose chest CT.              Methods:                    We performed a retrospective study of low dose chest CT scans in 54 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Raw data were reconstructed using FBP, iterative reconstruction (ASIR-V 70%) and deep learning based algorithms at high, medium and low-strength (DLIR -H, -M, -L). Filtered FBP images served as reference. Pulmonary emphysema volume (proportion of voxels below -950 UH) was measured on each reconstruction dataset and visually assessed by a chest radiologist. Quantitative image quality was assessed by placing 3 regions of interest in the trachea, in air and in a paraspinal muscle. Signal to noise ratio was also measured.              Results:                    The mean CDTIvol was 2.38 Â± 0.68 mGy. Significant differences in emphysema volumes between the filtered FBP reference and ASIR-V, DLIR-H, DLIR-M or DLIR-L were observed, (p < 10-3) for all. A strong correlation between filtered FBP volumes and DLIR-H was reported (r = 0.999, p < 10-4), a 10% overestimation with DLIR-H being observed. Noise was significantly reduced in DLIR-H volumes compared to the other reconstruction methods. Signal to noise ratio was improved when using DLIR-H (p < 10-6).              Conclusion:                    There are significant differences regarding emphysema volumes between FBP, iterative reconstruction or deep learning-based DLIR algorithm. DLIR-H shows the closest correlation to filtered FBP while increasing SNR.",-1
Precision of the Hologic DXA in the Assessment of Visceral Adipose Tissue,"Introduction:                    Visceral fat, also known as visceral adipose tissue (VAT), has been the focus of intensive research over the past several yr, as ground breaking studies have investigated its possible role in predicting long-term cardiac dysfunction, hypertension, and diabetes. Historically, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were the instruments of choice for visceral fat quantification. However, with the introduction of visceral fat assessment software for Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanners, DXA's use for VAT assessment has become increasingly common. To effectively utilize DXA in future VAT research studies, information about their precision and accuracy must be known. This study provides novel information regarding the precision of the Hologic Horizon DXA scanner in the assessment of VAT.              Methods:                    Sixty individuals (32.7 Â± 17.1 yr, 51% male, 40% with body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2) above the age of 16 years were recruited to participate in this study. Subjects found to be pregnant, have a lumbar vertebral compression fracture, nonremovable metal implants in the abdomen, or scoliosis/lordosis/kyphosis were excluded from the study. All subjects underwent 3 consecutive whole body scans on a Hologic Horizon A DXA scanner.              Results:                    VAT mass ranged from 102 g to 1454 g. VAT precision improved with increasing BMI (p = 0.025): coefficient of variation (%CV) was 15.2% for underweight subjects (n = 2), 7.1% for healthy subjects (n = 34), 6.4% for overweight subjects (n = 18), and 4.7% for obese subjects (n = 6).              Conclusions:                    VAT measurement by Hologic DXA displays a satisfactory level of precision in individuals with a BMI of >18.5 kg/m2. Precision was found to be higher in those with the greatest risk of cardio-metabolic dysfunction (individuals with high VAT). Due to its low cost, brief examination time, noninvasiveness, and limited radiation exposure, DXA may be considered the tool of choice for VAT determination in future studies.",-1
"Species Composition, Parous Rate, and Infection Rate of Anopheles Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in Bahir Dar City Administration, Northwest Ethiopia","Anopheles mosquitoes are the main vectors of malaria. There is little information on the current entomological aspects of Anopheles mosquitoes in Amhara region of northwestern Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevailing species composition, parous rate, and infection rate of Anopheles mosquitoes in the Bahir Dar city administration. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January through July 2020. For this, six Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps (three traps indoor and three traps outdoor) were used to collect adult female Anopheles mosquitoes. The species were morphologically identified, and the parous and infection rates were determined via dissection of ovaries and salivary gland, respectively. A total of 378 adult female Anopheles mosquitoes comprised of three species (Anopheles d'thali, Anopheles rhodesiensis, and Anopheles gambiae complex) were collected and identified at the study sites. Anopheles rhodesiensis was the predominant species accounting for 90% of all collections at the Zenzelima site, followed by An. gambiae complex (6.5%). In contrast, An. gambiae complex was the predominant species at the Tis Abay site, comprising 94% of captures. The overall parous and infection rates were 35 (62.5%) and 1 (2.9%), respectively.",-1

"Gut Microbiota Interact With the Brain Through Systemic Chronic Inflammation: Implications on Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Aging","It has been noticed in recent years that the unfavorable effects of the gut microbiota could exhaust host vigor and life, yet knowledge and theory are just beginning to be established. Increasing documentation suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis not only impacts brain cognition and psychiatric symptoms but also precipitates neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). How the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a machinery protecting the central nervous system (CNS) from the systemic circulation, allows the risky factors derived from the gut to be translocated into the brain seems paradoxical. For the unique anatomical, histological, and immunological properties underpinning its permeable dynamics, the BBB has been regarded as a biomarker associated with neural pathogenesis. The BBB permeability of mice and rats caused by GM dysbiosis raises the question of how the GM and its metabolites change BBB permeability and causes the brain pathophysiology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (NF&ND) and brain aging, a pivotal multidisciplinary field tightly associated with immune and chronic systemic inflammation. If not all, gut microbiota-induced systemic chronic inflammation (GM-SCI) mainly refers to excessive gut inflammation caused by gut mucosal immunity dysregulation, which is often influenced by dietary components and age, is produced at the interface of the intestinal barrier (IB) or exacerbated after IB disruption, initiates various common chronic diseases along its dispersal routes, and eventually impairs BBB integrity to cause NF&ND and brain aging. To illustrate the immune roles of the BBB in pathophysiology affected by inflammatory or ""leaky"" IB resulting from GM and their metabolites, we reviewed the selected publications, including the role of the BBB as the immune barrier, systemic chronic inflammation and inflammation influences on BBB permeability, NF&ND, and brain aging. To add depth to the bridging role of systemic chronic inflammation, a plausible mechanism indispensable for BBB corruption was highlighted; namely, BBB maintenance cues are affected by inflammatory cytokines, which may help to understand how GM and its metabolites play a major role in NF&ND and aging.",-1
MiR-128-1-5p regulates differentiation of ovine stromal vascular fraction by targeting the KLF11 5'-UTR,"Fat content is an important index to evaluate the individual performance of livestock animals such as sheep for meat production purposes. Reducing the subcutaneous and visceral fat while increasing the intramuscular fat is a valuable goal to achieve for the meat production industry. Here, we investigated the effect of miR-128-1-5p on adipogenesis of subcutaneous fat by targeting 5'-UTR in KLF11, a rare mechanism where most miRNAs bind the 3'-UTR of mRNAs. A dual fluorescence reporter assay was conducted to validate the binding sites of miR-128-1-5p on 5'-UTR of KLF11 mRNA. Roles of miR-128-1-5p in KLF11 expression were measured through co-transfecting miRNA mimics with KLF11-expressing vectors (CDSs together with or without the 5'-UTR) into ovine stromal vascular fractions (SVF). Additionally, functional roles of miR-128-1-5p, and KLF11 in adipogenesis of ovine subcutaneous fat were investigated. Results showed that miR-128-1-5p targeted KLF11 5'-UTR, reduced the fluorescence activity of the dual fluorescent reporter vector, as well as KLF11 mRNA, and protein expression levels. During the differentiation of SVF, disturbing the expression of miR-128-1-5p and KLF11 changed the adipogenic differentiation of SVF as observed in the lipid formation, and adipogenic marker genes. This study indicates that miR-128-1-5p promotes the expression of lipogenic marker genes and the formation of lipid droplets by targeting KLF11 5'-UTR. Furthermore, overexpression, and inhibition of KLF11 indicate that KLF11 inhibited SVF differentiation. In summary, the 5'-UTR binding mechanism discovered in this study extends the understanding of miRNA functions. Key roles of miR-128-1-5p and KLF11 in the adipogenesis of sheep subcutaneous fat have potential values for improving the meat and/or fat ratio of domestic animals.",-1
Identification and Contribution of Inflammation-Induced Novel MicroRNA in the Pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"Recently microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as powerful regulators of many genes and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by production of various autoantibodies, inflammatory immune cells, and dysregulation of epigenetic changes. Several candidate miRNAs regulating inflammation and autoimmunity in SLE are described. In this study, we found significant increases in the expression of miR21, miR25, and miR186 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE patients compared to healthy controls. However, miR146a was significantly decreased in SLE patients compared to healthy controls and was negatively correlated with plasma estradiol levels and with SLE disease activity scores (SLEDAI). We also found that protein levels of IL-12 and IL-21 were significantly increased in SLE patients as compared to healthy controls. Further, our data shows that protein levels of IL-12 were positively correlated with miR21 expression and protein levels of IL-21 positively correlated with miR25 and miR186 expression in SLE patients. In addition, we found that levels of miR21, miR25, and miR186 positively correlated with SLEDAI and miR146a was negatively correlated in SLE patients. Thus, our data shows a dynamic interplay between disease pathogenesis and miRNA expression. This study has translational potential and may identify novel therapeutic targets in patients with SLE.",-1
Manipulation of cadmium and diethylhexyl phthalate on Rana chensinensis tadpoles affects the intestinal microbiota and fatty acid metabolism,"Gastrointestinal tract and intestine microbiota can both have deep effects on the lipid metabolism and immune function of amphibians. Additionally, the composition and structure of the microbial community are influenced by environmental pollutions. It is noteworthy that environmental compounds such as Cd and DEHP are pervasive in the aquatic environment and do not exist in isolation, and single exposure experiments cannot well explain the effects of unpredictable interactions between co-existing compounds on amphibians. In this study, we calculated the parameters of morphological and histological indices of Rana chensinensis tadpoles after treated with Cd and/or DEHP. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology was used to assess the relative abundance of intestinal microbial community among tadpoles from each treatment groups. We also examined the mRNA expression levels of lipid digestion and absorption and SCFAs related-genes. Our results indicated that all morphological and histological indices were significantly declined in the Cd treatment group, while the mixed treatment group was similar to the control group. Compared with the control group, the relative abundances of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia exhibited distinctive differences in Cd and/or DEHP treatment groups. Further, RT-qPCR results revealed that the expression levels of lipid metabolism and SCFAs related-genes were also significantly altered among the treatment groups. Taken together, the present study highlighted a new evidence that the alterations in intestinal microbial community and mRNA expression levels of larval amphibians after exposure to Cd and/or DEHP may impair lipid storage and transport, as well as reduce anti-inflammatory capacity, which may ultimately lead to a decline in amphibian populations.",-1
Identification and Characterization of miRNAs and Their Predicted mRNAs in the Larval Development of Pearl Oyster Pinctada fucata,"As an important economic shellfish, the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata, and its larvae are an ideal model for studying molecular mechanisms of larval development in invertebrates. Larval development directly affects the quantity and quality of pearl oysters. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may play important roles in development, but the effects of miRNA expression on P. fucata early development remain unknown. In this study, miRNA and mRNA transcriptomics of seven different P. fucata developmental stages were analyzed using Illumina RNA sequencing. A total of 329 miRNAs, including 87 known miRNAs and 242 novel miRNAs, and 33,550 unigenes, including 26,333 known genes and 7217 predicted new genes, were identified in these stages. A cluster analysis showed that the difference in the numbers of miRNAs was greatest between fertilized eggs and trochophores. In addition, the integrated mRNA transcriptome was used to predict target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs between adjacent developmental stages, and the target genes were subjected to a gene ontology enrichment analysis. Using the gene ontology annotation, 100 different expressed genes and 95 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified as part of larval development regulation. Real-time PCR was used to identify eight mRNAs and three miRNAs related to larval development. The present findings will be helpful for further clarifying the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA in invertebrate larval development.",-1
The Natural Course of Impaired Fasting Glucose,"Impaired glucose regulation, including diabetes and prediabetes, poses a huge global problem not only in health but also in the epidemiological and economic areas. These disorders are often detected too late or remain unrecognized. The article aims to provide a review of the prevalence, etiology, and natural history of impaired fasting glucose (IFG). We focus on the progression of isolated IFG to full-fledged type 2 diabetes and the factors conducive to the development of diabetes. The knowledge about it could help design an optimal management program for the prevention of diabetes in patients with IFG; a program that would be patient-tailored and based on the underlying pathophysiology.",-1
Clinical value of serum miR-320-3p expression in predicting the prognosis of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury,"Background:                    For investigating the expression of miR-320-3p in children with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and its prognostic value.              Methods:                    A total of 142 patients were grouped into a survival group (n = 95) and death group (n = 47), which was based on their 28-day survival. Serum degrees of miR-320-3p, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipid carrier protein (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) were detected. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health scoring system â?(APACHE â? marks were recorded. Target gene forecast and functional enrichment discussion of miR-320-3p were performed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network diagram was plotted by applying bioinformatics methods. Multivariate logistic regression, ROC curve and Pearson correlation analysis were applied.              Results:                    The death group showed greatly higher serum levels of miR-320-3p, KIM-1 and APACHE â?scores than the survival group (p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that levels of miR-320-3p, NGAL, KIM-1 and APACHE â?scores were independent risk elements for death in sepsis children with AKI (p < 0.01). According to ROC curve analysis, the region under the curve (0.963, 95% CI: 0.908-0.996) of miR-320-3p, NGAL, KIM-1 levels and APACHE â?scores combined to forecast the death of kids suffering from sepsis and AKI were the biggest. According to correlation analysis, the expression degree of serum miR-320-3p in the death group was positively correlated with NGAL, KIM-1 and APACHE â?scores (all p < 0.01).              Conclusions:                    The expression level of serum miR-320-3p in children with sepsis-induced AKI was significantly increased, and the combination of NGAL, KIM-1 and APACHE â?scores has good value for prognosis prediction in children.",-1
Malignant Bone Tumors Diagnosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based on Deep Learning Algorithms,"Background and Objectives: Malignant bone tumors represent a major problem due to their aggressiveness and low survival rate. One of the determining factors for improving vital and functional prognosis is the shortening of the time between the onset of symptoms and the moment when treatment starts. The objective of the study is to predict the malignancy of a bone tumor from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using deep learning algorithms. Materials and Methods: The cohort contained 23 patients in the study (14 women and 9 men with ages between 15 and 80). Two pretrained ResNet50 image classifiers are used to classify T1 and T2 weighted MRI scans. To predict the malignancy of a tumor, a clinical model is used. The model is a feed forward neural network whose inputs are patient clinical data and the output values of T1 and T2 classifiers. Results: For the training step, the accuracies of 93.67% for the T1 classifier and 86.67% for the T2 classifier were obtained. In validation, both classifiers obtained 95.00% accuracy. The clinical model had an accuracy of 80.84% for training phase and 80.56% for validation. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the clinical model shows that the algorithm can perform class separation. Conclusions: The proposed method is based on pretrained deep learning classifiers which do not require a manual segmentation of the MRI images. These algorithms can be used to predict the malignancy of a tumor and on the other hand can shorten the time of their diagnosis and treatment process. While the proposed method requires minimal intervention from an imagist, it needs to be tested on a larger cohort of patients.",-1
Computational Intelligence for Observation and Monitoring: A Case Study of Imbalanced Hyperspectral Image Data Classification,"Imbalance in hyperspectral images creates a crisis in its analysis and classification operation. Resampling techniques are utilized to minimize the data imbalance. Although only a limited number of resampling methods were explored in the previous research, a small quantity of work has been done. In this study, we propose a novel illustrative study of the performance of the existing resampling techniques, viz. oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid sampling, for removing the imbalance from the minor samples of the hyperspectral dataset. The balanced dataset is classified in the next step, using the tree-based ensemble classifiers by including the spectral and spatial features. Finally, the comparative study is performed based on the statistical analysis of the outcome obtained from those classifiers that are discussed in the results section. In addition, we applied a new ensemble hybrid classifier named random rotation forest to our dataset. Three benchmark hyperspectral datasets: Indian Pines, Salinas Valley, and Pavia University, are applied for performing the experiments. We have taken precision, recall, F score, Cohen kappa, and overall accuracy as assessment metrics to evaluate our model. The obtained result shows that SMOTE, Tomek Links, and their combinations stand out to be the more optimized resampling strategies. Moreover, the ensemble classifiers such as rotation forest and random rotation ensemble provide more accuracy than others of their kind.",-1
Association of equol producing status with aortic calcification in middle-aged Japanese men: The ERA JUMP study,"Background:                    Equol, an isoflavone (ISF)-derived metabolite by the gut microbiome in certain individuals termed as equol-producers, might be the key anti-atherogenic component of ISFs. Our objective was to determine the association between equol-producing status and aortic atherosclerosis assessed as aortic calcification (AC).              Methods:                    This population-based study of 302 Japanese men aged 40-49, free of cardiovascular disease, examined serum levels of equol and ISFs, AC in the entire aorta by electron-beam computed tomography with Agatston method, and cardiovascular risk factors. We defined equol-producers as individuals with serum levels of equol â?0 nM and prevalent AC as an AC score â?10. We analyzed the association between equol-producing status and AC using Tobit and logistic regressions. We performed age-stratified analyses since age was a significant effect-modifier.              Results:                    The 70th to 90th percentile AC scores were 4 to 243 in equol-producers and 15 to 444 in non-producers, respectively. Overall, equol-producers (41% of the sample) had lower AC scores (-209, [95% confidence interval (CI): -455, 36]) and odds of AC (odds ratio (OR): 0.7 [95% CI: 0.4, 1.3]), although not statistically significant, compared to non-producers after controlling for cardiovascular risk factors. Among men aged 46-49, equol-producers had significantly lower AC scores (-428 [95% CI: -827, -29]). Furthermore, there were null associations between serum levels of ISFs and both AC score and the odds of AC.              Conclusion:                    In middle-aged Japanese men, equol-producers had a non-significantly lower burden of aortic atherosclerosis than non-producers whereas ISFs had a null association. Studies with larger sample sizes in both sexes are warranted.",-1
Influence of air pollutants on circulating inflammatory cells and microRNA expression in acute myocardial infarction,"Air pollutants increase the risk and mortality of myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to assess the inflammatory changes in circulating immune cells and microRNAs in MIs related to short-term exposure to air pollutants. We studied 192 patients with acute coronary syndromes and 57 controls with stable angina. For each patient, air pollution exposure in the 24-h before admission, was collected. All patients underwent systematic circulating inflammatory cell analyses. According to PM2.5 exposure, 31 patients were selected for microRNA analyses. STEMI patients exposed to PM2.5 showed a reduction of CD4+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, in STEMI patients the exposure to PM2.5 was associated with an increase of miR-146a-5p and miR-423-3p. In STEMI and NSTEMI patients PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increase of miR-let-7f-5p. STEMI related to PM2.5 short-term exposure is associated with changes involving regulatory T cells, miR-146a-5p and miR-423-3p.",-1
Bifidobacterium longum CCFM1077 Ameliorated Neurotransmitter Disorder and Neuroinflammation Closely Linked to Regulation in the Kynurenine Pathway of Autistic-like Rats,"The kynurenine pathway (KP) is abnormal in autistic patients and model animals. According to studies on the brain-gut axis, probiotics can help ameliorate the metabolic abnormalities of the KP in patients and model animals with neurological diseases. This study was aimed at evaluating the ability of Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) CCFM077 to enhance the gut microbiome and KP metabolism and regulate the neurotransmitter levels and neuroinflammation of autistic rats. The KP metabolism of autistic rats was significantly disordered and significantly related to the regulation of neurotransmitter (excitation and inhibition) and neuroglia states. B. longum CCFM1077 could effectively alleviate autistic-like behaviours (repetitive stereotyped behaviour, learning and memory ability, and despair mood) and regulate the KP metabolism in the periphery system (gut and blood) and brain. In particular, B. longum CCFM1077 could significant regulate the quinolinic acid (QUIN) level in the brain and markedly regulate glutamic acid (Glu) and Glu/Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the brain while alleviating microglia activity in the cerebellum. Through a correlation analysis, the QUIN level in the brain was strongly related with autistic-like behaviours and neurotransmitter levels (GABA and Glu). The QUIN level may thus be a potential therapeutic marker for treating autism through the intestinal and neural pathways.",-1
"Randomized controlled trial of early, small-volume formula supplementation among newborns: A study protocol","Childhood undernutrition is a major health burden worldwide that increases childhood morbidity and mortality and causes impairment in infant growth and developmental delays that can persist into adulthood. The first weeks and months after birth are critical to the establishment of healthy growth and development during childhood. The World Health Organization recommends immediate and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). In infants for whom EBF may not meet nutritional and caloric demands, early, daily, small-volume formula supplementation along with breastfeeding may more effectively avoid underweight wasting and stunting in early infancy than breastfeeding alone. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of formula for 30 days among low birth weight (LBW) infants <6 hours of age and those not LBW with weights <2600 grams at 4 days of age. We will compare breastfeeding and formula (up to 59 milliliters administered daily) through 30 days of infant age vs recommendations for frequent EBF without supplementation, and test the hypothesis that formula increases weight-for-age z-score at 30 days of infant age. The trial will enroll and randomize 324 mother-infant pairs in Guinea-Bissau and Uganda, and follow them for 6 months for outcomes including growth, intestinal microbiota, breastfeeding duration, infant dietary intake, and adverse events. Conservatively estimating 20% loss to follow up, this sample size provides â?0% power per weight stratum for intervention group comparison to detect a difference of 0.20 with respect to the outcome of WAZ at day 30. This trial was approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Review Board (19-29405); the Guinea-Bissau National Committee on Ethics in Health (Comite Nacional de Etica na Saude, 075/CNES/INASA/2020); the Higher Degrees, Research and Ethics Committee of Makerere University (871); and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (HS1226ES). We plan to disseminate study results in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. Trial registration number: NCT04704076.",-1
Obesity and ethnicity alter gene expression in skin,"Obesity is accompanied by dysfunction of many organs, but effects on the skin have received little attention. We studied differences in epithelial thickness by histology and gene expression by Affymetrix gene arrays and PCR in the skin of 10 obese (BMI 35-50) and 10 normal weight (BMI 18.5-26.9) postmenopausal women paired by age and ethnicity. Epidermal thickness did not differ with obesity but the expression of genes encoding proteins associated with skin blood supply and wound healing were altered. In the obese, many gene expression pathways were broadly downregulated and subdermal fat showed pronounced inflammation. There were no changes in skin microbiota or metabolites. African American subjects differed from European Americans with a trend to increased epidermal thickening. In obese African Americans, compared to obese European Americans, we observed altered gene expression that may explain known differences in water content and stress response. African Americans showed markedly lower expression of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator characteristic of the disease cystic fibrosis. The results from this preliminary study may explain the functional changes found in the skin of obese subjects and African Americans.",-1
Dynamics of body mass index and visceral adiposity index in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with tofacitinib,"The increase in cardiovascular risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with the general population is due to the combined effect of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, systemic inflammation, and side effects of antirheumatic drugs. Tofacitinib (TOFA) is an oral reversible inhibitor of janus kinases for the treatment of RA with proven efficacy and good tolerability, but its effects on body weight and metabolic profile need to be clarified. We investigated the effects of TOFA on body mass index (BMI) and visceral adiposity index (VAI) in RA patients. Thirty-one consecutive patients with active RA and starting new treatment with TOFA were included in a prospective 1 year follow-up observational study of cardiovascular effects of TOFA treatment. Weight, height, waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting glucose and VAI were measured at baseline and 12 months of treatment. Median weight gain was 3 kg (4.2%) after 1 year of TOFA. 23 (74%) patients suffered from a weight gain, and 6 (26%) out of them from a weight increment of 10% or more. Patients with lower BMI (p = 0.024) and higher baseline DAS28 [ESR] (p = 0.017) have the risk of an increase in BMI > 5% during TOFA treatment in a multivariate analysis. A decrease in VAI after 12 months was recorded. Weight increment and improvement of VAI are frequent on TOFA treatment. BMI dynamics associated with higher disease activity at baseline and lower baseline BMI.",-1
Gut Microbiome and Bile Acid Metabolism Induced the Activation of CXCR5+ CD4+ T Follicular Helper Cells to Participate in Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Recurrence,"From the perspective of the role of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the destruction of tolerance in disease progression, more attention has been paid to their role in autoimmunity. To address the role of Tfh cells in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) recurrence, serum C-X-C motif ligand 13 (CXCL13) levels reflect the effects of the Tfh cells on B-cell-mediated humoral immunity. We evaluated the immunobiology of the CXCR5+CD4+ Tfh cells in 46 patients with NMOSD, including 37 patients with NMOSD with an annual recurrence rate (ARR) of<1 and 9 patients with NMOSD with an ARR of â?. Herein, we reported several key observations. First, there was a lower frequency of circulating Tfh cells in patients with an ARR of<1 than in those with an ARR of â? (P< 0.05). Second, the serum CXCL13 levels were downregulated in individuals with an ARR<1 (P< 0.05), processing the ability to promote Tfh maturation and chemotaxis. Third, the level of the primary bile acid, glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), was higher in patients with NMOSD with an ARR of<1 than in those with NMOSD with an ARR of â?, which was positively correlated with CXCL13. Lastly, the frequency of the Tfh precursor cells decreased in the spleen of keyhole limpet haemocyanin-stimulated animals following GUDCA intervention. These findings significantly broaden our understanding of Tfh cells and CXCL13 in NMOSD. Our data also reveal the potential mechanism of intestinal microbiota and metabolites involved in NMOSD recurrence.",-1
Advances in Immunomodulation and Immune Engineering Approaches to Improve Healing of Extremity Wounds,"Delayed healing of traumatic wounds often stems from a dysregulated immune response initiated or exacerbated by existing comorbidities, multiple tissue injury or wound contamination. Over decades, approaches towards alleviating wound inflammation have been centered on interventions capable of a collective dampening of various inflammatory factors and/or cells. However, a progressive understanding of immune physiology has rendered deeper knowledge on the dynamic interplay of secreted factors and effector cells following an acute injury. There is a wide body of literature, both in vitro and in vivo, abstracted on the immunomodulatory approaches to control inflammation. Recently, targeted modulation of the immune response via biotechnological approaches and biomaterials has gained attention as a means to restore the pro-healing phenotype and promote tissue regeneration. In order to fully realize the potential of these approaches in traumatic wounds, a critical and nuanced understanding of the relationships between immune dysregulation and healing outcomes is needed. This review provides an insight on paradigm shift towards interventional approaches to control exacerbated immune response following a traumatic injury from an agonistic to a targeted path. We address such a need by (1) providing a targeted discussion of the wound healing processes to assist in the identification of novel therapeutic targets and (2) highlighting emerging technologies and interventions that utilize an immunoengineering-based approach. In addition, we have underscored the importance of immune engineering as an emerging tool to provide precision medicine as an option to modulate acute immune response following a traumatic injury. Finally, an overview is provided on how an intervention can follow through a successful clinical application and regulatory pathway following laboratory and animal model evaluation.",-1
Challenges and future directions for studying effects of host genetics on the gut microbiome,"The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that is involved in its host's metabolism, immunity and health. Although interindividual variations in gut microbial composition are mainly driven by environmental factors, some gut microorganisms are heritable and thus can be influenced by host genetics. In the past 5 years, 12 microbial genome-wide association studies (mbGWAS) with >1,000 participants have been published, yet only a few genetic loci have been consistently confirmed across multiple studies. Here we discuss the state of the art for mbGWAS, focusing on current challenges such as the heterogeneity of microbiome measurements and power issues, and we elaborate on potential future directions for genetic analysis of the microbiome.",-1
Fetal fractional limb volumes in pregnancies following bariatric surgery,"Introduction:                    Obesity rates have reached an epidemic level and bariatric surgery is the most effective method of sustainable weight loss. Pregnancy following bariatric surgery is associated with an increased prevalence of small babies. The objective of the study is to compare the fetal fat distribution, as assessed by fractional arm and thigh volume using three-dimensional ultrasonography, in pregnancies following maternal bariatric surgery with those without such history.              Material and methods:                    This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational study conducted in a Maternity Unit in the UK. The study included 189 pregnant women; 63 with previous bariatric surgery [27 restrictive (13 with gastric band, 14 with sleeve gastrectomy) and 36 malabsorptive procedures] and 126 with no previous surgery but similar maternal booking body mass index. Fetal arm and thigh volume were obtained at 30-33 and 35-37 weeks' gestation and fractional limb volumes were calculated using a commercially available software. Women underwent a 75 g, 2 h oral glucose tolerance test at 28-31 weeks of gestation.              Results:                    Overall, adjusted fetal arm and thigh volume were smaller in the post-bariatric, compared to the no surgery, group and this was more marked in women who had undergone a previous sleeve gastrectomy (P < .001 and P = .002, respectively) or a malabsorptive procedure (P < .001 for both). There was a strong positive correlation between maternal fasting/post-prandial (2 h) glucose levels, at the time of the oral glucose tolerance test, and arm and thigh volume at both 30-33 and 35-37 weeks (P < .01 for all).              Conclusions:                    The study has demonstrated that in the third trimester of pregnancy, fetuses of women with previous bariatric surgery have smaller fractional limb volumes, therefore less soft tissue, compared to fetuses of women without such surgery and this may be related to the lower maternal glucose levels seen in the former pregnancies.",-1
Deep learning kidney segmentation with very limited training data using a cascaded convolution neural network,"Background:                    Deep learning segmentation requires large datasets with ground truth. Image annotation is time consuming and leads to shortages of ground truth data for clinical imaging. This study is to investigate the feasibility of kidney segmentation using deep learning convolution neural network (CNN) models trained with MR images from only a few subjects.              Methods:                    A total of 60 subjects from two cohorts were included in this study. The first cohort of 20 subjects from publicly available data was used for training and testing. The second cohort of 40 subjects with renal masses from our institution was used for testing only. A few-shot deep learning approach using 3D augmentation was investigated. T1-weighted images in the first cohort were used for training and testing. Cascaded CNN networks were trained using images from one, three, and six subjects, respectively. Images for the remaining subjects were used for testing. Images in the second cohort were utilized for testing only. Dice and Jaccard coefficients were generated to evaluate the performance of CNN models. Statistical analyses for segmentation metrics among different approaches were performed.              Results:                    Our approach achieved mean Dice coefficients of 0.85 using a single training subject and 0.91 with six training subjects. Compared to a single Unet, the cascaded network significantly improved the results using a single training subject (Dice, 0.759 vs. 0.835; p<0.001) and three subjects (0.864 vs. 0.893; p = 0.015) in the first cohort, and the results for the second cohort (0.821 vs. 0.873; p = 0.008).              Conclusion:                    Our few-shot kidney segmentation approach using 3D augmentation achieved a good performance even using a single Unet. Furthermore, the cascaded network significantly improved the performance of segmentation and was superior to a single Unet in certain cases. Our approach provides a promising solution to segmentation in medical imaging when the number of ground truth masks is limited.",-1
Phenomic data-facilitated rust and senescence prediction in maize using machine learning algorithms,"Current methods in measuring maize (Zea mays L.) southern rust (Puccinia polyspora Underw.) and subsequent crop senescence require expert observation and are resource-intensive and prone to subjectivity. In this study, unoccupied aerial system (UAS) field-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) was employed to collect high-resolution aerial imagery of elite maize hybrids planted in the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons, with 13 UAS flights obtained from 2020 and 17 from 2021. In total, 36 vegetation indices (VIs) were extracted from mosaicked aerial images that served as temporal phenomic predictors for southern rust scored in the field and senescence as scored using UAS-acquired mosaic images. Temporal best linear unbiased predictors (TBLUPs) were calculated using a nested model that treated hybrid performance as nested within flights in terms of rust and senescence. All eight machine learning regressions tested (ridge, lasso, elastic net, random forest, support vector machine with radial and linear kernels, partial least squares, and k-nearest neighbors) outperformed a general linear model with both higher prediction accuracies (92-98%) and lower root mean squared error (RMSE) for rust and senescence scores (linear model RMSE ranged from 65.8 to 2396.5 across all traits, machine learning regressions RMSE ranged from 0.3 to 17.0). UAS-acquired VIs enabled the discovery of novel early quantitative phenotypic indicators of maize senescence and southern rust before being detectable by expert annotation and revealed positive correlations between grain filling time and yield (0.22 and 0.44 in 2020 and 2021), with practical implications for precision agricultural practices.",-1
Serum Neurofilament Light Chain as a Marker of Progression in Parkinson's Disease: Long-Term Observation and Implications of Clinical Subtypes,"Background:                    Biochemical and clinical biomarkers correlate with progression rate and disease severity in Parkinson's disease (PD) but are not sufficiently studied in late PD.              Objective:                    To examine how serum neurofilament light chain (S-NfL) alone or combined with clinical classifications predicts PD outcome in later disease stages.              Methods:                    Eighty-five patients with 7.9Â±5.1 years of PD duration were included in an observational cohort. Clinical scores were obtained at two separate examinations 8.2Â±2.0 years apart. S-NfL levels were determined with single molecule array (SiMoA). Five predefined disease progression milestones were assessed. After affirming combination potential of S-NfL and either of two clinical classifications, three combined models were constructed based on these factors and age at onset in different combinations.              Results:                    S-NfL levels showed significant hazard ratios for four out of five disease progression milestones: walking-aid usage (HR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4-8.5), nursing home living (5.1; 2.1-12.5), motor end-stage (6.2; 2.1-17.8), and death (4.1; 1.7-9.7). Higher S-NfL levels were associated with lower ability in activities of daily living and poorer cognition at baseline and/or at follow-up. Combined models showed significantly improved area under receiver operating characteristic curves (0.77-0.91) compared to S-NfL levels alone (0.68-0.71) for predicting the five disease milestones.              Conclusion:                    S-NfL levels stratified patients according to their likelihood to reach clinically relevant progression milestones during this long-term observational study. S-NfL alone reflected motor and social outcomes in later stages of PD. Combining S-NfL with clinical factors was possible and exploratory combined models improved prognostic accuracy.",-1
[Epilepsy detection and analysis method for specific patient based on data augmentation and deep learning],"In recent years, epileptic seizure detection based on electroencephalogram (EEG) has attracted the widespread attention of the academic. However, it is difficult to collect data from epileptic seizure, and it is easy to cause over fitting phenomenon under the condition of few training data. In order to solve this problem, this paper took the CHB-MIT epilepsy EEG dataset from Boston Children's Hospital as the research object, and applied wavelet transform for data augmentation by setting different wavelet transform scale factors. In addition, by combining deep learning, ensemble learning, transfer learning and other methods, an epilepsy detection method with high accuracy for specific epilepsy patients was proposed under the condition of insufficient learning samples. In test, the wavelet transform scale factors 2, 4 and 8 were set for experimental comparison and verification. When the wavelet scale factor was 8, the average accuracy, average sensitivity and average specificity was 95.47%, 93.89% and 96.48%, respectively. Through comparative experiments with recent relevant literatures, the advantages of the proposed method were verified. Our results might provide reference for the clinical application of epilepsy detection.",-1
Neuron-specific enolase level is a useful biomarker for distinguishing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from cervical spondylotic myelopathy,"The current study aimed to evaluate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels are elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and are effective in distinguishing ALS from cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). We retrospectively evaluated 45 patients with ALS, 23 with CSM, 28 controls, and 10 with Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent analysis of CSF NSE levels. The control group comprised patients aged above 45 years who underwent lumbar puncture because of suspected neurological disorders that were ruled out after extensive investigations. CSF NSE levels were evaluated using the electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay. The ALS group had significantly higher CSF NSE levels than the CSM and control groups (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The CSM, control, and PD groups did not significantly differ in terms of CSF NSE levels. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic value of CSF NSE levels in distinguishing ALS from CSM. The area under the curve for CSF NSE levels was 0.86. The optimal cutoff value was 17.7 ng/mL, with a specificity of 87% and a sensitivity of 80%. Hence, CSF NSE levels are elevated in ALS and are effective in distinguishing ALS from CSM.",-1
Serum hormone levels and normal breast histology among premenopausal women,"Purpose:                    Breast terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) are the main source of breast cancer (BC) precursors. Higher serum concentrations of hormones and growth factors have been linked to increased TDLU numbers and to elevated BC risk, with variable effects by menopausal status. We assessed associations of circulating factors with breast histology among premenopausal women using artificial intelligence (AI) and preliminarily tested whether parity modifies associations.              Methods:                    Pathology AI analysis was performed on 316 digital images of H&E-stained sections of normal breast tissues from Komen Tissue Bank donors ages â?45 years to assess 11 quantitative metrics. Associations of circulating factors with AI metrics were assessed using regression analyses, with inclusion of interaction terms to assess effect modification.              Results:                    Higher prolactin levels were related to larger TDLU area (p < 0.001) and increased presence of adipose tissue proximate to TDLUs (p < 0.001), with less significant positive associations for acini counts (p = 0.012), dilated acini (p = 0.043), capillary area (p = 0.014), epithelial area (p = 0.007), and mononuclear cell counts (p = 0.017). Testosterone levels were associated with increased TDLU counts (p < 0.001), irrespective of parity, but associations differed by adipose tissue content. AI data for TDLU counts generally agreed with prior visual assessments.              Conclusion:                    Among premenopausal women, serum hormone levels linked to BC risk were also associated with quantitative features of normal breast tissue. These relationships were suggestively modified by parity status and tissue composition. We conclude that the microanatomic features of normal breast tissue may represent a marker of BC risk.",-1
Olfaction in Anopheles mosquitoes,"As vectors of disease, mosquitoes are a global threat to human health. The Anopheles mosquito is the deadliest mosquito species as the insect vector of the malaria-causing parasite, which kills hundreds of thousands every year. These mosquitoes are reliant on their sense of smell (olfaction) to guide most of their behaviors, and a better understanding of Anopheles olfaction identifies opportunities for reducing the spread of malaria. This review takes a detailed look at Anopheles olfaction. We explore a range of topics from chemosensory receptors, olfactory neurons, and sensory appendages to behaviors guided by olfaction (including host-seeking, foraging, oviposition, and mating), to vector management strategies that target mosquito olfaction. We identify many research areas that remain to be addressed.",-1
"Subglottic Hemangioma: Now You See it, Now You Don't","Subglottic hemangiomas may be missed on flexible laryngoscopy or even bronchoscopy requiring a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan to clinch the diagnosis. We report an otherwise healthy three-month baby girl presenting with recurrent upper airway obstruction with a history of multiple admissions requiring intubation and artificial ventilation. An initial contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan was performed when the child was intubated, which showed no airway anomalies. Subsequent flexible laryngoscopy and diagnostic bronchoscopy showed features of laryngomalacia and subglottic edema; hence, an endoscopic laser-assisted supraglottoplasty was performed. Following the surgical intervention, the child had persistent stridor and a repeat contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan clinched a diagnosis of a localised subglottic hemangioma at the age of 7 months. In the presence of an endotracheal tube, airway hemangiomas may be missed on bronchoscopy and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan. Key Word: Subglottic stenosis, Congenital, Hemangiomas, Computed tomography.",-1
The research for PLTS normalization method based on minimum entropy change and its application in MAGDM problem,"In the problem of multiple attributes group decision making (MAGDM), the probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) is an useful tool which can be more flexible and accurate to express the evaluation information of decision makers (DMs). However, due to the lack of time or knowledge, DMs tend to provide the evaluation information by incomplete PLTSs (InPLTSs) which contain missing information. The process to estimate the missing information of InPLTSs is essential, which is called the normalization of InPLTSs. By analyzing the previous methods, the existing defect is that the original uncertainty information of InPLTS can be hardly retained after normalizing. Moreover, the literature that considers the normalization method from perspective of entropy change is absent. Thus, to overcome the shortcoming and fill the research blank, we propose two optimization models based on minimum entropy change of InPLTSs, which can remain the original uncertainty information of InPLTSs to the greatest extent. Inspired by entropy measure of PLTSs, the novel concepts related to entropy measure of InPLTS are developed. In addition, based on the novel normalization method, a decision model is constructed to solve the MAGDM problem. To verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method and model, a case about the selection of five-star scenic spots is given and we conduct to have comparative analysis with other methods.",-1
Bioactive Evaluation of Ursane-Type Pentacyclic Triterpenoids: Î²-Boswellic Acid Interferes with the Glycosylation and Transport of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma A549 Cells,"Ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids exert various biological effects, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. We previously reported that ursolic acid, corosolic acid, and asiatic acid interfered with the intracellular trafficking and glycosylation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1Î±. However, the structure-activity relationship of ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids remains unclear. In the present study, the biological activities of seven ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids (Î²-boswellic acid, uvaol, madecassic acid, 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-Î²-boswellic acid, ursolic acid, corosolic acid, and asiatic acid) were investigated. We revealed that the inhibitory activities of ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids on the cell surface expression and glycosylation of ICAM-1 and Î±-glucosidase activity were influenced by the number of hydroxy groups and/or the presence and position of a carboxyl group. We also showed that Î²-boswellic acid interfered with ICAM-1 glycosylation in a different manner from other ursane-type pentacyclic triterpenoids.",-1
SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding of Glycated Serum Albumin-Its Potential Role in the Pathogenesis of the COVID-19 Clinical Syndromes and Bias towards Individuals with Pre-Diabetes/Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases,"The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection requires antibody recognition of the spike protein. In a study designed to examine the molecular features of anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, patient plasma proteins binding to pre-fusion stabilised complete spike and nucleocapsid proteins were isolated and analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. Amongst the immunoglobulins, a high affinity for human serum albumin was evident in the anti-spike preparations. Careful mass comparison revealed the preferential capture of advanced glycation end product (AGE) forms of glycated human serum albumin by the pre-fusion spike protein. The ability of bacteria and viruses to surround themselves with serum proteins is a recognised immune evasion and pathogenic process. The preference of SARS-CoV-2 for AGE forms of glycated serum albumin may in part explain the severity and pathology of acute respiratory distress and the bias towards the elderly and those with (pre)diabetic and atherosclerotic/metabolic disease.",-1
Premature cognitive decline in specific domains found in young veterans with mTBI coincide with elder normative scores and advanced-age subjects with early-stage Parkinson's disease,"Importance:                    Epidemiologists report a 56% increased risk of veterans with (+) mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) developing Parkinson's disease (PD) within 12-years post-injury. The most relevant contributors to this high risk of PD in veterans (+) mTBI is unknown. As cognitive problems often precede PD diagnosis, identifying specific domains most involved with mTBI-related PD onset is critical.              Objectives:                    To discern which cognitive domains underlie the mTBI-PD risk relationship proposed in epidemiology studies.              Design and setting:                    This exploratory match-controlled, cross-sectional study was conducted in a medical school laboratory from 2017-2020.              Participants:                    Age- and IQ-matched veterans with (+) and without mTBI, non-veteran healthy controls, and IQ-matched non-demented early-stage PD were compared. Chronic neurological, unremitted/debilitating diseases, disorders, dementia, and substance use among others were excluded.              Exposure:                    Veterans were or were not exposed to non-penetrating combat-related mTBI occurring within the past 7-years. No other groups had recent military service or mTBI.              Main outcomes / measures:                    Cognitive flexibility, attention, memory, visuospatial ability, and verbal fluency were examined with well-known standardized neuropsychological assessments.              Results:                    Out of 200 volunteers, 114 provided evaluable data. Groups significantly differed on cognitive tests [F (21,299) = 3.09, p<0.0001]. Post hoc tests showed veterans (+) mTBI performed significantly worse than matched-control groups on four out of eight cognitive tests (range: p = .009 to .049), and more often than not performed comparably to early-stage PD (range: p = .749 to .140).              Conclusions and relevance:                    We found subtle, premature cognitive decline occurring in very specific cognitive domains in veterans (+) mTBI that would typically be overlooked in a clinic setting, This result potentially puts them at-risk for continual cognitive decline that may portend to the eventual onset of PD or some other neurodegenerative disease.",-1
METTL3 mediates osteoblast apoptosis by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress during LPS-induced inflammation,"Osteoblast apoptosis is a prominent factor for disrupting skeletal homeostasis in multiple inflammatory bone diseases. METTL3, a key methyltransferase that catalyzes the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA, has recently been shown to exert a critical role in osteogenic differentiation. However, the function of METTL3 in osteoblast apoptosis under inflammatory conditions remains elusive. In the present study, we observed that the total m6A level and METTL3 expression were upregulated in differentiated osteoblasts and downregulated after LPS stimulation. METTL3 knockdown induced a higher apoptotic rate in LPS-treated osteoblasts. The expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 decreased, and the apoptotic proteins cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved PARP-1 and cleaved Caspase-12 increased following METTL3 knockdown. Meanwhile, METTL3 silencing inhibited osteoblast proliferation and decreased osteogenic marker expression, ALP activity and mineralized nodules. RNA-seq analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in unfolded protein response pathways in METTL3-deficient cells. METTL3 depletion upregulated the expression of the ER stress-related markers, including p-PERK, p-eIF2Î±, p-IRE1Î±, GRP78, ATF4, CHOP and ATF6. Inhibition of ER stress by 4-PBA remarkably rescued METTL3 knockdown-induced apoptosis and promoted osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, METTL3 depletion enhanced the expression and mRNA stability of Grp78, and similar results were observed after YTHDF2 knockdown. RIP-qPCR revealed that YTHDF2 directly interacted with Grp78 mRNA and that the interaction relied on METTL3. Taken together, our study demonstrated that METTL3 knockdown enhanced Grp78 expression through YTHDF2-mediated RNA degradation, which elicited ER stress, thereby promoting osteoblast apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation and differentiation under LPS-induced inflammatory condition.",-1

Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease characterized by abdominal discomfort and bloating, diarrhea, and/or constipation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is transferring the fecal bacteria and other microorganisms from a healthy person to another. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of FMT in treating IBS patients. We searched Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases through June 2021 using relevant key words. We included 19 studies. Fecal microbiota transplantation was significantly superior to placebo in IBS quality of life after 4 weeks (mean difference [MD] = 7.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.05-12.89, p = .04), 12 weeks (MD = 9.99, 95% CI: 5.78-14.19, p < .00001), and 24 weeks (MD = 8.49, 95% CI: 0.47-16.52, p = .04), with no difference regarding IBS improvement symptoms and the IBS Severity Scoring System (SSS). Single-arm analysis revealed that the incidence of improvement of IBS symptoms was 57.8% (45.6%-69.9%) with reduction in IBS-SSS (MD = -74, 95% CI: -101.7 to -46.3). Fecal microbiota transplantation was superior to placebo in improving quality of life after 4, 12, and 24 weeks. Also, FMT improved IBS symptoms and reduced the IBS-SSS score. However, no deference was detected between FMT and placebo in IBS-SSS score and IBS symptoms improvement.",-1
Transfer learning strategy for plastic pollution detection in soil: Calibration transfer from high-throughput HSI system to NIR sensor,"Rapid detection tasks in soil environment are generally implemented by various spectrometers and chemometric models. To reduce costs for model construction, calibration transfer from laboratory spectral instruments to portable devices has recently received extensive attention. In different application cases of model transference, most conventional methods require extra time to tune hyperparameters and to select calibration transfer techniques. Based on the near-infrared (NIR) analytical technique, this work aimed at exploring a transfer learning strategy to detect plastic pollution levels in the soil by transferring the model from a high-throughput hyperspectral image (HSI) system to an ultra-portable NIR sensor. Transfer learning was explored to diagnose the proper calibration transfer algorithm and construct the transferable model. For transferable model construction, conventional calibration transfer algorithms (Direct Standardization (DS) or Repeatability file (Repfile)) served as a pre-processing step, and non-parametric transfer learning algorithm (Easy Transfer Learning (EasyTL)) was explored in the modeling step. Supporting vector machine (SVM) was carried out as a typical modeling algorithm for comparison. For transformation algorithms selection, a distance metric algorithm, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), was performed on spectral feature matrices before and after DS or Repfile transformation. On three transfer tasks, the results indicated that the Repfile-EasyTL model was a promising solution with higher accuracy, much lower time costs, less parameters, and dependency on the increase of standard samples than other models (SVM, DS-SVM, Repfile-SVM, EasyTL, DS-EasyTL). Moreover, MMD distance presented the great potential to serve as an indicator to vote the optimal calibration transfer algorithm before the modeling step.",-1
Microbiomes in physiology: insights into 21st-century global medical challenges,"New findings:                    What is the topic of this review? The role of the gut microbiome in physiology and how it can be targeted as an effective strategy against two of the most important global medical challenges of our time, namely, metabolic diseases and antibacterial resistance. What advances does it highlight? The critical roles of the microbiome in regulating host physiology and how microbiome analysis is useful for disease stratification to enable informed clinical decisions and develop interventions such as faecal microbiota transplantation, prebiotics and probiotics. Also, the limitations of microbiome modulation, including the potential for probiotics to enhance antimicrobial resistance gene reservoirs, and that currently a 'healthy microbiome' that can be used as a biobank for transplantation is yet to be defined.              Abstract:                    The human gut microbiome is a key factor in the development of metabolic diseases and antimicrobial resistance, which are among the greatest global medical challenges of the 21st century. A recent symposium aimed to highlight state-of-the-art evidence for the role of the gut microbiome in physiology, from childhood to adulthood, and the impact this has on global disease outcomes, ageing and antimicrobial resistance. Although the gut microbiome is established early in life, over time the microbiome and its components including metabolites can become perturbed due to changes such as dietary habits, use of antibiotics and age. As gut microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids and trimethylamine-N-oxide, can interact with host receptors including G protein-coupled receptors and can alter host metabolic fluxes, they can significantly affect physiological homoeostasis leading to metabolic diseases. These metabolites can be used to stratify disease phenotypes such as irritable bowel syndrome and adverse events after heart failure and allow informed decisions on clinical management and treatment. While strategies such as use of probiotics, prebiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation have been proposed as interventions to treat and prevent metabolic diseases and antimicrobial resistance, caution must be exercised, first due to the potential of probiotics to enhance antimicrobial resistance gene reservoirs, and second, a 'healthy gut microbiome' that can be used as a biobank for transplantation is yet to be defined. We highlight that sampling other parts of the gastrointestinal tract may produce more representative data than the faecal microbiome alone.",-1
Designing nanoformulation for the nose-to-brain delivery in Parkinson's disease: Advancements and barrier,"Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which results in the loss of motor activity. In the management of PD, the primary aim is to increase the dopamine content in the brain either by delivering the precursors of dopamine or by inhibiting the molecules responsible for dopamine degradation. Due to the low bioavailability, a higher dosage of drugs needs to be administered repeatedly for achieving the desired therapeutic effect. This repeated high dose not only increases the severe side effects but also produces tolerance in the body. Often, direct administration of drugs fails to ameliorate the symptoms as the unmodified drugs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Nanotherapeutic is at the forefront of the alternative treatment against the central nervous system (CNS) disorders due to the ability to circumvents the BBB. Here, all the available treatments for PD have been discussed with their limitation. The current trends of nanotherapeutics for PD have been explored. Suitability and formulation prospects for nasal delivery have been analyzed in detail to explore new research scope. The most effective approach is the nose-to-brain delivery for targeting drugs directly to the brain. This delivery bypasses the BBB and concentrates more drugs at the target site. Thus, developments of nose-to-brain delivery of nanoformulations explicit the new scope to manage PD better.

Postprandial Triglyceride-Rich Lipoproteins from Type 2 Diabetic Women Stimulate Platelet Activation Regardless of the Fat Source in the Meal,"Scope:                    The aim of this study is to examine whether postprandial (PP) triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL) secreted after a moderate fat intake would activate platelets differently according to their fatty acid (FA) composition.              Methods and results:                    In a parallel single-blind randomized trial, 30 women with type 2 diabetes are assigned a breakfast containing 20 g lipids from butter versus hazelnut-cocoa spread (HCS) rich in palm oil. Blood samples are collected at fasting and 4 h PP. FA composition of fasting and PP TGRL and their effects on the activation of platelets from healthy blood donors are assessed. Both breakfasts similarly increase plasma ApoB-48, plasma, and TGRL triglycerides (p < 0.05). TGRL mean diameter increases after both breakfasts and is greater after the butter breakfast. Both breakfasts are rich in palmitic acid, and the HCS breakfast contains 45% oleic acid. TGRL FA composition reflects the dietary FA composition. Pre-incubation of platelets with fasting and PP TGRL increases collagen-stimulated aggregation (p < 0.01 vs control). Fasting and PP TGRL similarly increase agonist-induced thromboxane B2 concentrations, and this effect is concentration-dependent for PP TGRL.              Conclusion:                    PP TGRL from type 2 diabetic women after a palm-oil spread versus butter-based mixed meal induce similar acute in vitro platelet activation.",-1
"Recent advances in understanding object recognition in the human brain: deep neural networks, temporal dynamics, and context","Object recognition is the ability to identify an object or category based on the combination of visual features observed. It is a remarkable feat of the human brain, given that the patterns of light received by the eye associated with the properties of a given object vary widely with simple changes in viewing angle, ambient lighting, and distance. Furthermore, different exemplars of a specific object category can vary widely in visual appearance, such that successful categorization requires generalization across disparate visual features. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the neural representations underlying object recognition in the human brain. We highlight three current trends in the approach towards this goal within the field of cognitive neuroscience. Firstly, we consider the influence of deep neural networks both as potential models of object vision and in how their representations relate to those in the human brain. Secondly, we review the contribution that time-series neuroimaging methods have made towards understanding the temporal dynamics of object representations beyond their spatial organization within different brain regions. Finally, we argue that an increasing emphasis on the context (both visual and task) within which object recognition occurs has led to a broader conceptualization of what constitutes an object representation for the brain. We conclude by identifying some current challenges facing the experimental pursuit of understanding object recognition and outline some emerging directions that are likely to yield new insight into this complex cognitive process.",-1
Supervised learning using routine surveillance data improves outbreak detection of Salmonella and Campylobacter infections in Germany,"The early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is a crucial task to protect population health. To this end, public health surveillance systems have been established to systematically collect and analyse infectious disease data. A variety of statistical tools are available, which detect potential outbreaks as abberations from an expected endemic level using these data. Here, we present supervised hidden Markov models for disease outbreak detection, which use reported outbreaks that are routinely collected in the German infectious disease surveillance system and have not been leveraged so far. This allows to directly integrate labeled outbreak data in a statistical time series model for outbreak detection. We evaluate our model using real Salmonella and Campylobacter data, as well as simulations. The proposed supervised learning approach performs substantially better than unsupervised learning and on par with or better than a state-of-the-art approach, which is applied in multiple European countries including Germany.",-1
Minimal effective dose of lactic-fermented egg white on visceral fat in Japanese men: a double-blind parallel-armed pilot study,"Background:                    We previously reported that the consumption of 8 g of protein per day in the form of lactic-fermented egg white (LAFEW) improves visceral fat obesity. In this study, we investigated the minimum effective intake of LAFEW for visceral fat reduction in the Japanese males with mild obesity.              Methods:                    Twenty-two Japanese adult males with a Body mass index (BMI) â?4 and a waist circumference â?85 cm were included in this study. The subjects were divided into three groups, that is, control group, LAFEW 6 g group, and LAFEW 8 g group. The LAFEW 6 and 8 g groups consumed 6 and 8 g, respectively, of egg white protein (EWP) in a drink at breakfast for 8 weeks, whereas the control group consumed a drink containing 8 g of milk whey protein. Body weight, body fat percentage, abdominal circumference, and visceral fat (VF) area around the navel were measured at 0 and 8 weeks after initiating the consumption.              Results:                    No changes in body weight or body fat percentage were observed in any of the groups. No significant differences between the pre- and posttreatment measurements were found in the VF area around the navel in the control group and the LAFEW 6 g group. In the LAFEW 8 g group, the VF area had decreased significantly after 8 weeks of consumption, when compared to that before consumption, and the average observed decrease (Îcm2) was 13.2 Â± 4.7 cm2. Among the subjects with an initial BMI > 25, the VF area was significantly smaller in the LAFEW 8 group, when compared to the week 0 values and those in the control group. Visceral fat/subcutaneous fat values in the LAFEW 8 group were also significantly smaller than those in the control group or at week 0.              Conclusion:                    The results suggested that the minimum effective intake of EWP in the LAFEW to reduce the VF area in the Japanese men is 8 g.              Trial registration:                    This clinical trial was retrospectively registered with the University hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Center, ( UMIN000031681 ; registered on 12/03/2018).",-1
Association between prolonged separation from parents and allostatic load among children in China,"Objective:                    To capture the association of exposure to prolonged separation from both parents early in life and allostatic load (AL), a measure of biological multi-system dysregulation.              Methods:                    We used data from 557 7-12-year-old children enrolled in rural area of Chizhou city, Anhui Province, China. We computed an AL score based on eleven biomarkers representing four regulatory systems: immune/inflammatory system (high sensitivity C-reactive protein); metabolic system (body mass index; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein, total cholesterol; triglycerides; fasting glucose; glycated hemoglobin; insulin) and cardiovascular system (systolic and diastolic blood pressure). Child's experiences of parent-child separation were collected a brief online questionnaire by parents of children.              Results:                    More than 1 in 3 of our participants separated with both parents at age 6 or younger and nearly 1 in 10 persistently separated from both parents after birth. The AL score was significantly higher among children separated from both parents during early childhood (3.25 Â± 1.98) or persistently since birth (3.48 Â± 1.92), compared with those who did not separated from both parents (2.34 Â± 1.53, F = 12.992, P<0.001). After adjustment of demographic covariates, body mass index as well as parent frequency of communication and parental warmth, children who separated from both parents in early childhood (Î² = 0.84, 95%CI:0.40, 1.28, P < 0.001) or persistently into adolescence (Î² = 1.27, 95%CI:0.43, 2.12, P = 0.003) evinced the highest levels of AL.              Conclusion:                    This study is the first to show an association between prolonged parent-child separation and physiological wear-and-tear as measured by AL, which provides potential insights into the biological mechanisms underpinning long-term health outcomes in contexts of parent-child separation.",-1
Variation of Serum Uric Acid Is Associated With Gut Microbiota in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease closely related to a disordered gut microbiome. Diabetic patients usually suffer from various metabolic disorders, such as increased serum uric acid levels. Although serum uric acid levels depend partially on intestine excretion, the relationship between uric acid and gut microbiome in diabetic patients remains unknown. We collected a total of 126 fecal samples from diabetic patients for 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing and recorded clinical data. We analyzed the correlation between clinical indicators and gut microbiota of diabetic patients using Spearman analysis. Since uric acid was the most prominent one, we classified diabetic patients based on their uric acid levels to find the microbiome associated with uric acid disturbance. We constructed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway profiles using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) to identify variations between the different groups. Among all the clinical indicators, uric acid had the strongest correlation with gut microbiota. First, we divided the patients into three groups according to their uric acid levels. The two low uric acid groups were similar, while the elevated uric acid group had significant differences in gut microbiota and metabolic pathways. The elevated uric acid group had a significantly lower gut microbiota diversity. At the genus level, this group had remarkably higher Escherichia-Shigella amounts and notably lower Faecalibacterium, Oscillospiraceae_UCG-002, and Oscillospiraceae_UCG-005 amounts. The gut microbiota of the high uric acid group was predicted to be enriched in metabolism, human diseases, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Since the two low uric acid groups were similar, we regrouped and matched the abnormal uric acid patients with normal uric acid patients. The differences in gut microbiota and metabolic pathways related to nucleotide metabolism became more significant. The serum uric acid levels were associated with gut microbiome changes. This might be related to uric acid metabolism by gut microbes. Our study indicates that targeting the gut microbiome could help manage elevated uric acid levels.",-1
Bevacizumab attenuates osteosarcoma angiogenesis by suppressing MIAT encapsulated by serum-derived extracellular vesicles and facilitating miR-613-mediated GPR158 inhibition,"Targeting angiogenesis has been considered a promising treatment for a large number of malignancies, including osteosarcoma. Bevacizumab (Bev) is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor being used for this purpose. We herein investigate the therapeutic potential of Bev in angiogenesis during osteosarcoma and the related mechanisms. Bioinformatics were performed for identification of osteosarcoma-related microarray dataset to collect related lncRNA and miRNA, with MIAT and miR-613 obtained. The predicted binding site between miR-613 and GPR158 3'UTR region was further confirmed by luciferase assay. Then, their effects combined with treatment with Bev on osteosarcoma cells were explored by the gain- and loss-of-function. After extraction from osteosarcoma patients' serum (serum-EVs) and identification, EVs were co-cultured with osteosarcoma cells, the biological behaviors of which were detected by CCK-8 assay and microtubule formation in vitro. A mouse tumor xenograft model was used to determine the effect of Bev on tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Bev inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. Besides, serum-EVs could transfer MIAT (EV-MIAT) into osteosarcoma cells, where it is competitively bound to miR-613 to elevate GPR158, thus promoting osteosarcoma cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, Bev arrested osteosarcoma cell proliferation and angiogenesis by inhibiting EV-MIAT and inducing miR-613-mediated GPR158 inhibition. In conclusion, the Bev-mediated MIAT/miR-613/GPR158 regulatory feedback revealed a new molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma angiogenesis.",-1
MiRNAs in milk can be used towards early prediction of mammary gland inflammation in cattle,"Considering the importance of early disease detection for reducing the huge financial and animal welfare impact of bovine mastitis globally, improved tools are urgently needed that can accurately detect early mammary inflammation. MiRNAs have demonstrated value as disease biomarkers, however, their potential for accurately detecting early mammary inflammation has not been examined in detail. To address this, we investigated the association between levels of four inflammation-associated miRNAs (bta-miR-26a, bta-miR-142-5p, bta-miR-146a and bta-miR-223) and CMT scores (0 to 3) obtained from a large number of individual quarter milk samples (n = 236) collected from dairy cows at different lactations (1 to 4). Initial analyses (n = 21 samples) confirmed that the levels of each of bta-miR-142-5p, bta-miR-146a and bta-miR-223 in whole milk were significantly correlated with mRNA levels of known inflammatory markers (HP, TNF, CXCL8 and IL1B) in milk cells (Rho â?0.49, P < 0.005). Subsequent analyses (n = 215 samples) revealed a significant effect of CMT score on each of the four miRNAs analysed (P < 0.0001), characterised by a progressive increase in miRNA levels in milk as CMT score increase from 0 to > 1. Moreover, a significant effect of lactation number (P < 0.01) for bta-miR-26a, bta-miR-142-5p and bta-miR-146a was attributed to higher miRNA levels during lactation 1 than later lactations. Finally, by generating ROC curves we showed that bta-miR-223 and bta-miR-142-5p levels could identify early inflammatory changes in individual quarter milk samples (CMT1) with high accuracy (100% sensitivity, > 81% specificity). Our results provide novel proof of the value of miRNAs as early diagnostic biomarkers of bovine mastitis.",-1
Intelligent Monitoring System Based on Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition Feature Extraction and Neural Networks,"Because of the nonlinearity and nonstationarity in the vibration signals of some rotating machinery, the analysis of these signals using conventional time- or frequency-domain methods has some drawbacks, and the results can be misleading. In this paper, a couple of features derived from multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) are introduced, which overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional features. A wind turbine gearbox and its bearings are investigated as rotating machinery. In this method, two types of feature structures are extracted from the decomposed signals resulting from the MEMD algorithm, called intrinsic mode function (IMF). The first type of feature vector element is the energy moment of effective IMFs. The other type of vector elements is amplitudes of a signal spectrum at the characteristic frequencies. A correlation factor is used to detect effective IMFs and eliminate the redundant IMFs. Since the basic MEMD algorithm is sensitive to noise, a noise-assisted extension of MEMD, NA-MEMD, is exploited to reduce the effect of noise on the output results. The capability of the proposed feature vector in health condition monitoring of the system is evaluated and compared with traditional features by using a discrimination factor. The proposed feature vector is utilized in the input layer of the classical three-layer backpropagation neural network. The results confirm that these features are appropriate for intelligent fault detection of complex rotating machinery and can diagnose the occurrence of early faults.",-1
Whole Agrocybe cylindracea Prevented Obesity Linking with Modification of Gut Microbiota and Associated Fecal Metabolites in High-Fat Diet-Fed Mice,"Scope:                    Whole-food-based strategies to prevent metabolic diseases are growing interests. Agrocybe cylindracea (AC) is a major edible mushroom with high values of nutrition, but little is known about its health benefits as a portion of whole food.              Methods and results:                    Diet-induced obese, C57BL/6J mice are fed an high-fat diet (HFD) with or without AC (3% or 5%, w/w in the diet) for 9 weeks. The results show that dietary AC reduced body weight, adipose accumulation, impairment of glucose tolerance, lipid levels, and liver injury in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, AC not only prevents HFD-induced gut disorder, as indicates by the enriched probiotic Bifidobacterium and reduced endotoxin-bearing Proteobacteria, but also improve the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level and gut tissue structure. Fecal metabolites such as harmine and harmanine are also remarkably altered by AC. Spearman's correlation analysis reveals that the AC-altered microbes and metabolites are strongly correlated with obesity-related indexes.              Conclusion:                    These findings suggest that dietary AC prevents HFD-induced obesity and its complications in association with modulating gut microbiota and associated fecal metabolites.",-1
Histopathologic Oral Cancer Prediction Using Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Biopsy Empowered with Transfer Learning,"Oral cancer is a dangerous and extensive cancer with a high death ratio. Oral cancer is the most usual cancer in the world, with more than 300,335 deaths every year. The cancerous tumor appears in the neck, oral glands, face, and mouth. To overcome this dangerous cancer, there are many ways to detect like a biopsy, in which small chunks of tissues are taken from the mouth and tested under a secure and hygienic microscope. However, microscope results of tissues to detect oral cancer are not up to the mark, a microscope cannot easily identify the cancerous cells and normal cells. Detection of cancerous cells using microscopic biopsy images helps in allaying and predicting the issues and gives better results if biologically approaches apply accurately for the prediction of cancerous cells, but during the physical examinations microscopic biopsy images for cancer detection there are major chances for human error and mistake. So, with the development of technology deep learning algorithms plays a major role in medical image diagnosing.

The miRNA-21-5p Payload in Exosomes from M2 Macrophages Drives Tumor Cell Aggression via PTEN/Akt Signaling in Renal Cell Carcinoma,"M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment are important drivers of cancer metastasis. Exosomes play a critical role in the crosstalk between different cells by delivering microRNAs or other cargos. Whether exosomes derived from pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages (M2-Exos) could modulate the metastatic behavior of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is unclear. This study found that M2-Exos promotes migration and invasion in RCC cells. Inhibiting miR-21-5p in M2-Exos significantly reversed their pro-metastatic effects on RCC cells in vitro and in the avian embryo chorioallantoic membrane in vivo tumor model. We further found that the pro-metastatic mechanism of miR-21-5p in M2-Exos is by targeting PTEN-3'UTR to regulate PTEN/Akt signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate that M2-Exos carries miR-21-5p promote metastatic features of RCC cells through PTEN/Akt signaling. Reversing this could serve as a novel approach to control RCC metastasis.",-1
Signal Processing Techniques Applied to Axial Transmission Ultrasound,"A new application of ultrasonography has been emerging in the bone quantitative ultrasound arena in the last twenty years: cortical bone characterization using axial transmission ultrasound (ATU). Although challenged by the complicated cortical tissue-ultrasonic wave interaction, ATU has proved to have promising potential to be a valuable diagnostic tool in the assessment of cortical bones. This chapter reviews the main landmarks of axial transmission signal processing in the past decade to provide a guide to the diversity of available techniques. In order to increase the readability of the chapter, the signal processing methods are categorized based on the experimental settings: single and multiple transmitter-receiver configuration. The review considers the key stages required for the analysis of bone guided-wave ultrasound data namely dispersion energy imaging, modal filtering, dispersion curve inversion, and measurement automation with integrated artificial intelligence concepts. Besides discussing the recent signal processing advances in the field of bone assessment by axial transmission, this communication offers developments that might be anticipated in the near future.",-1
Identifying Effects of Urinary Metals on Type 2 Diabetes in U.S. Adults: Cross-Sectional Analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2016,"Growing evidence supports the associations of metal exposures with risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the methodological limitations overlook the complexity of relationships within the metal mixtures. We identified and estimated the single and combined effects of urinary metals and their interactions with prevalence of T2D among 3078 participants in the NHANES 2011-2016. We analyzed 15 urinary metals and identified eight metals by elastic-net regression model for further analysis of the prevalence of T2D. Bayesian kernel machine regression and the weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models identified four metals that had greater importance in T2D, namely cobalt (Co), tin (Sn), uranium (U) and strontium (Sr). The overall OR of T2D was 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.08) for the positive effects and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98-1.02) for the negative effect in the WQS models. We observed positive (Poverall = 0.008 and Pnon-linear = 0.100 for Co, Poverall = 0.011 and Pnon-linear = 0.138 for Sn) and inverse (Poverall = 0.001, Pnon-linear = 0.209 for Sr) linear dose-response relationships with T2D by restricted cubic spline analysis. Both additive and multiplicative interactions were found in urinary Sn and Sr. In conclusion, urinary Co, Sn, U and Sr played important roles in the development of T2D. The levels of Sn might modify the effect of Sr on T2D risk.",-1
The larval environment strongly influences the bacterial communities of Aedes triseriatus and Aedes japonicus (Diptera: Culicidae),"Mosquito bacterial communities are essential in mosquito biology, and knowing the factors shaping these bacterial communities is critical to their application in mosquito-borne disease control. This study investigated how the larval environment influences the bacterial communities of larval stages of two container-dwelling mosquito species, Aedes triseriatus, and Aedes japonicus. Larval and water samples were collected from tree holes and used tires at two study sites, and their bacteria characterized through MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial richness was highest in Ae. japonicus, intermediate in Ae. triseriatus, and lowest in water samples. Dysgonomonas was the dominant bacterial taxa in Ae. triseriatus larvae; the unclassified Comamonadaceae was dominant in water samples from waste tires, while Mycobacterium and Carnobacterium, dominated Ae. japonicus. The two mosquito species harbored distinct bacterial communities that were different from those of the water samples. The bacterial communities also clustered by habitat type (used tires vs. tree holes) and study site. These findings demonstrate that host species, and the larval sampling environment are important determinants of a significant component of bacterial community composition and diversity in mosquito larvae and that the mosquito body may select for microbes that are generally rare in the larval environment.",-1
Exploration of consumer preference based on deep learning neural network model in the immersive marketing environment,"The study intends to increase the marketing quantity of various commodities and promote the comprehensive development of the market. The study first discusses the principle and current situation of the emerging Immersive Marketing. Then, it analyzes the Deep Learning (DL) Neural Network (NN) model. Finally, a Personalized Recommendation System (PRS) is designed based on the Immersive Marketing environment using the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model. The proposed PRS based on the Immersive Graph Neural Network (IGNN) model has reflected higher advantages over other recommendation systems. The experiment results suggest that Immersive Marketing can fully reflect commodities' essential attributes and characteristics, improve users' shopping experience, and promote sales. Meanwhile, the IGNN-based PRS reported here gives users an elevated and immersive shopping experience and entertainment process. Lastly, the model comparison finds that the proposed IGNN outperforms other models. The optimal model parameters are verified as P@20 and R@20 to gain the highest composite index values. In particular, parameter R@20 gives the model a better performance over P@20. The study provides technical references for improving the marketing process of various commodities and entertainment products and contributes to marketing technology development.",-1
Adipocyte-secreted exosomal microRNA-34a inhibits M2 macrophage polarization to promote obesity-induced adipose inflammation,"Persistent, unresolved inflammation in adipose tissue is a major contributor to obesity-associated metabolic complications. However, the molecular links between lipid-overloaded adipocytes and inflammatory immune cells in obese adipose tissues remain elusive. Here we identified adipocyte-secreted microRNA-34a (miR-34a) as a key mediator through its paracrine actions on adipose-resident macrophages. The expression of miR-34a in adipose tissues was progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity. Adipose-selective or adipocyte-specific miR-34a-KO mice were resistant to obesity-induced glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation, and this was accompanied by a significant shift in polarization of adipose-resident macrophages from proinflammatory M1 to antiinflammatory M2 phenotype. Mechanistically, mature adipocyte-secreted exosomes transported miR-34a into macrophages, thereby suppressing M2 polarization by repressing the expression of KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). The suppressive effects of miR-34a on M2 polarization and its stimulation of inflammatory responses were reversed by ectopic expression of Klf4 in both bone marrow-derived macrophages and adipose depots of obese mice. Furthermore, increased miR-34a expression in visceral fat of overweight/obese subjects correlated negatively with reduced Klf4 expression, but positively with the parameters of insulin resistance and metabolic inflammation. In summary, miR-34a was a key component of adipocyte-secreted exosomal vesicles that transmitted the signal of nutrient overload to the adipose-resident macrophages for exacerbation of obesity-induced systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.",-1
Gell-Mann-Low Criticality in Neural Networks,"Criticality is deeply related to optimal computational capacity. The lack of a renormalized theory of critical brain dynamics, however, so far limits insights into this form of biological information processing to mean-field results. These methods neglect a key feature of critical systems: the interaction between degrees of freedom across all length scales, required for complex nonlinear computation. We present a renormalized theory of a prototypical neural field theory, the stochastic Wilson-Cowan equation. We compute the flow of couplings, which parametrize interactions on increasing length scales. Despite similarities with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model, the theory is of a Gell-Mann-Low type, the archetypal form of a renormalizable quantum field theory. Here, nonlinear couplings vanish, flowing towards the Gaussian fixed point, but logarithmically slowly, thus remaining effective on most scales. We show this critical structure of interactions to implement a desirable trade-off between linearity, optimal for information storage, and nonlinearity, required for computation.",-1
Pueraria lobata Targeted Preparation Improves the Clinical Symptoms of Cervical Spondylosis by Regulating the Balance of Gut Microbiota,"Background:                    Nanotargeted preparations can enhance the safety and effectiveness of medication by altering the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs in the human body, and Pueraria lobata is shown to be effective in the treatment of neck and back pain.              Purpose:                    This study prepared a nano-Pueraria targeted preparation, in order to analyze its effect on improving the clinical symptoms of cervical spondylosis by adjusting the balance of intestinal flora.              Methods:                    A total of 200 patients with cervical spondylosis admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine were enrolled and divided into an observation group and a control group. The control group was given Tuina therapy, and the observation group was given nano-Pueraria targeted preparation + Tuina therapy. The clinical symptoms and intestinal microflora of the two groups were examined before intervention.              Results:                    It was found that the markedly effective of treatment efficacy of the observation group (98%) was higher than that of the control group (78%) after 15 days of intervention, and the clinical symptoms were obviously fewer than those of the control group. The distribution of gut microbiota showed that there were significant differences in the composition of gut microbiota between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the abundance of Firmicutes in the observation group was significantly higher, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria was significantly lower.              Conclusion:                    The targeted preparation of nano-Pueraria can improve the clinical symptoms of patients with cervical spondylosis by adjusting the balance of gut microbiota.",-1
A Novel Distachionate from Breynia distachia Treats Inflammations by Modulating COX-2 and Inflammatory Cytokines in Rat Liver Tissue,"Breynia distachia is a plant of genus Breynia belonging to family Phyllanthaceae. This study was conducted to isolate and examine the anti-inflammatory attributes of the roots of Breynia distachia. Methanol extract from roots were prepared by simple maceration. For phytochemical studies, isolation, purification, structure elucidation, metal analysis, total phenolic content, and solubility test were done by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by cotton pallet edema model and carrageenan paw edema model, and antioxidant potential was evaluated by DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS antioxidants assays. Metal analysis of BD.Me revealed the presence of Na &gt; Mg &gt; K &gt; Mn &gt; Fe = Zn in respective order. Four phytochemicals such as gallic acid, quercetin, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid are found in Breynia distachia. Quercetin is present in relatively larger quantity, and shows antioxidant activity by reducing the ferric iron to ferrous iron. Novel distachionate shows high antioxidant activity in ABTS assay by reducing reactive oxygen species. Quantitative or qualitative analysis performed by HPLC indicates the ascending peaks or presence of secondary products (metabolites) respectively. Histopathology analysis of liver, spleen, heart, and kidney was done, revealing mild inflammations in spleen and liver, and no cytotoxicity in heart and kidney. Oral administration of BD.Me and ditachionate significantly inhibits the carrageenan and cotton pellet-induced paw edema in 1st and 2nd h with (ns = p &gt; 0.05) than control. After 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th h, BD.Me and ditachionate showed inhibition of paw edema in a highly significant (*** = p &lt; 0.001) manner as compared to control. In cotton-pellet edema model, distachionate shows a %inhibition of 57.3% at a dose level of 5 mg/kg. Docking values obtained from distachionate-COX-2 complex suggest a potent inhibitor evaluated for this protein. The distachionate shows effective anti-inflammatory activity. Methanol extracts of roots showed significant lipoxygenase inhibitory activity by IC50 values of 155.7 Â± 0.55 and 132.9 Â± 0.33 Î¼g/mL. Data from various in vitro and in vivo models suggest that novel distachionate isolated from Breynia distachia shows strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities; it should be further studied for the exploration of its medicinal potential.",-1
The role of postprandial very-low-density lipoprotein in the development of atrial remodeling in metabolic syndrome,"Background:                    Negatively charged very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-Ï) in metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients exerts cytotoxic effects on endothelial cells and atrial myocytes. Atrial cardiomyopathy, manifested by atrial remodeling with a dilated diameter, contributes to atrial fibrillation pathogenesis and predicts atrial fibrillation development. The correlation of VLDL-Ï with atrial remodeling is unknown. This study investigated the association between VLDL-Ï and remodeling of left atrium.              Methods:                    Consecutively, 87 MetS and 80 non-MetS individuals between 23 and 74 years old (50.6% men) without overt cardiovascular diseases were included in the prospective cohort study. Blood samples were collected while fasting and postprandially (at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after a unified meal). VLDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation; the percentile concentration of VLDL-Ï (%) was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The correlations of left atrium diameter (LAD) with variables including VLDL-Ï, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, glucose, and blood pressure, were analyzed by multiple linear regression models. A hierarchical linear model was conducted to test the independencies of each variable's correlation with LAD.              Results:                    The mean LAD was 3.4 Â± 0.5 cm in non-MetS subjects and 3.9 Â± 0.5 cm in MetS patients (P < 0.01). None of the fasting lipid profiles were associated with LAD. VLDL-Ï, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and blood pressure were positively correlated with LAD (all P < 0.05) after adjustment for age and sex. Significant interactions between VLDL-Ï and blood pressure, waist circumference, and hip circumference were observed. When adjusted for obesity- and blood pressure-related variables, 2-h postprandial VLDL-Ï (mean 1.30 Â± 0.61%) showed a positive correlation with LAD in MetS patients. Each 1% VLDL-Ï increase was estimated to increase LAD by 0.23 cm.              Conclusions:                    Postprandial VLDL-Ï is associated with atrial remodeling particularly in the MetS group. VLDL-Ï is a novel biomarker and may be a therapeutic target for atrial cardiomyopathy in MetS patients.              Trial registration:                    ISRCTN 69295295 .

Exosomal lncRNA and mRNA profiles in polycystic ovary syndrome: bioinformatic analysis reveals disease-related networks,"Research question:                    What is the role of exosomal lncRNAs and mRNAs profiles and their interaction networks in regulating the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?              Design:                    LncRNA microarray was used to analyse the expression profiles of lncRNA and mRNA in follicular fluid exosomes from three patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and three control women. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied to explore biological functions of exosomal mRNAs in PCOS. Six PCOS-related genes were selected, and coding-non-coding gene co-expression (CNC) networks and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks analysis were combined to reveal lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction networks.              Results:                    A total of 5373 differentially expressed exosomal lncRNAs and 3381 differentially expressed exosomal mRNAs were identified (fold change â? and P < 0.05). Gene ontology analysis indicated that 14 terms of biological process were related to reproductive development. KEGG pathway analysis revealed PCOS-related pathways, such as MAPK signalling pathway and some inflammation-related signalling pathways. Interaction networks of lncRNAs, miRNAs and six PCOS-related genes (IRS1, CYP11A1, BMP6, FSHR, WNT4 and CYP19A1) were constructed. The CNC networks and ceRNA networks analysis uncovered some novel PCOS-related exosomal lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks.              Conclusions:                    Differential expression profiles of exosomal lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, and some PCOS-related biological processes and regulatory networks were indicated. LncRNAs and mRNAs in follicular fluid exosomes may play important roles in the follicular development of PCOS.",-1
Hypoketotic hypoglycemia in citrin deficiency: a case report,"Background:                    Citrin deficiency (CD) is a recessive metabolic disease caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC25A13. Although previous studies have reported ketosis in CD, it was observed at the time of euglycemia or mild hypoglycemia. Blood ketone levels concomitant with symptomatic or severe hypoglycemia in CD have not been a topic of focus despite its importance in identifying the etiology of hypoglycemia and assessing the ability of fatty acid utilization. Herein, we describe a patient with CD who had repeated episodes of hypoglycemia with insufficient ketosis.              Case presentation:                    A 1-year-old boy with repetitive hypoglycemia was referred to us to investigate its etiology. The fasting load for 13 h led to hypoketotic hypoglycemia, indicating the possibility of partial Î²-oxidation dysfunction. A genetic test led to the diagnosis of CD. The hypoglycemic episodes disappeared after switching to a medium-chain triglyceride-containing formula.              Conclusions:                    This case report suggests that symptomatic or severe hypoglycemia in patients with CD could be associated with relatively low levels of ketone bodies, implying that Î²-oxidation in these patients might possibly be partially disrupted. When encountering a patient with hypoglycemia, clinicians should check blood ketone levels and bear in mind the possibility of CD because excessive intravenous administration of glucose can cause decompensated symptoms in patients with CD as opposed to other disorders presenting with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, such as fatty acid oxidation disorders. Further studies in a large-scale cohort are warranted to confirm our speculation.",-1
"Early Changes in Adipose Tissue Morphology, Gene Expression, and Metabolism After RYGB in Patients With Obesity and T2D","Context:                    Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery effectively prevents or treats type 2 diabetes (T2D). Adipose tissue (AT) mechanisms may be of importance.              Objective:                    To assess the relationship between early changes in whole-body and AT metabolism in surgically treated patients with T2D.              Design and setting:                    A randomized single-center study.              Patients:                    Nineteen patients with T2D with body mass index 30 to 45 kg/m2.              Interventions:                    Thirteen patients were assessed at baseline and 4 and 24 weeks after RYGB (preceded by a 4-week low-calorie diet) and compared with 6 control patients continuing standard medical treatment: oral glucose tolerance test, subcutaneous AT biopsies for gene expression, adipocyte size, glucose uptake, lipolysis, and insulin action.              Results:                    At 4 and 24 weeks post-RYGB, all patients but one had stopped diabetes medication. Fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulin levels decreased and the Matsuda index increased compared with baseline (P < 0.01 for all), indicating improved whole-body insulin sensitivity. Mean adipocyte size significantly reduced, more at 4 than at 24 weeks; at 4 weeks, glucose uptake per adipocyte was lowered, and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis tended to increase, whereas the fold insulin effects on glucose uptake and lipolysis were unchanged. Expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, CPT1b and adiponectin, was increased at 4 weeks, whereas leptin and E2F1 (involved in cell proliferation) were reduced (P < 0.05 for all).              Conclusion:                    Glycemic control and in vivo insulin sensitivity improved 4 weeks after RYGB, but adipocyte insulin sensitivity did not change despite a marked reduction in adipocyte size. Thus, mechanisms for a rapid improvement of T2D after RYGB may occur mainly in other tissues than adipose.",-1
The AIM2 inflammasome is activated in astrocytes during the late phase of EAE,"Inflammasomes are a class of innate immune signaling platforms that activate in response to an array of cellular damage and pathogens. Inflammasomes promote inflammation under many circumstances to enhance immunity against pathogens and inflammatory responses through their effector cytokines, IL-1Î² and IL-18. Multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are autoimmune conditions influenced by inflammasomes. Despite work investigating inflammasomes during EAE, little remains known concerning the role of inflammasomes in the central nervous system (CNS) during the disease. Here, we used multiple genetically modified mouse models to monitor activated inflammasomes in situ based on oligomerization of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) in the spinal cord. Using inflammasome reporter mice, we found heightened inflammasome activation in astrocytes after the disease peak. In contrast, microglia and CNS-infiltrated myeloid cells had few activated inflammasomes in the CNS during EAE. Astrocyte inflammasome activation during EAE was dependent on absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), but low IL-1Î² release and no significant signs of cell death were found. Thus, the AIM2 inflammasome activation in astrocytes may have a distinct role from traditional inflammasome-mediated inflammation.",-1
A facile biosynthesis strategy of plasmid DNA-derived nanowires for readable microRNA logic operations,"Multiple microRNA (miRNA) logical assays have attracted wide attention recently, which can be applied to mimic and reveal cellular events at the molecular level. However, it remains challenging to develop labeling- and amplification-free approaches to perform logical functions with low levels of miRNA molecules. Herein, we proposed a strategy for miRNA logic operations using plasmid DNA-derived nanowires produced from a facile biosynthesis method. First, let-7d was chosen as the model target of the plasmid DNA-derived nanowire strategy, which showed good selectivity and a response sensitivity of as low as the femtomolar level. The operations of the miRNA logic gates proved the programmability of the constructed plasmid DNA-derived nanowire system for two inputs (let-7d and miR-21). Finally, three pairs of DNA nanowires were combined together to demonstrate the availability of this strategy in parallel multiple miRNAs assays. In this strategy, readout signals can be directly obtained from agarose gel without extra chemical labeling or amplification procedures. Considering the excellent performance of the logic gates with low levels of inputs, our plasmid DNA-derived nanowire strategy could provide a facile method to promote simultaneous multiple miRNA assays for the benefit of diagnosis and could be applied for the assembly of complex DNA nanostructures.",-1
Effects of prenatal nutrient supplementation and early life exposures on neurodevelopment at age 10: a randomised controlled trial - the COPSYCH study protocol,"Introduction:                    Nutrient deficiency and immune and inflammatory disturbances in early life may compromise neurodevelopment and be implicated in the aetiology of psychiatric disorders. However, current evidence is limited by its predominantly observational nature. COpenhagen Prospective Study on Neuro-PSYCHiatric Development (COPSYCH) is a research alliance between Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) and Center for Clinical Intervention and Neuropsychiatric Schizophrenia Research with the overall aim to investigate effects of prenatal and early life exposures on neurodevelopment at 10 years. COPSYCH will investigate the impact of prenatal n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) and high-dose vitamin D supplementation on neurodevelopment reflected by brain development, neurocognition and psychopathology. Moreover, the neurodevelopmental impact of early life exposures such as infections, low grade inflammation and the gut microbiome will be scrutinised.              Methods and analysis:                    COPSYCH is based on the prospective and ongoing COPSAC2010 birth cohort of 700 mother-child pairs. Randomised controlled trials of supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA and/or high-dose vitamin D or placebo in the third trimester were embedded in a factorial 2Ã2 design (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01233297 and NCT00856947). This unique cohort provides deep phenotyping data from 14 previous clinical follow-up visits and exposure assessments since birth. The ongoing 10-year visit is a 2-day visit. Day 1 includes a comprehensive neurocognitive examination, and assessment of psychopathological dimensions, and assessment of categorical psychopathology. Day 2 includes acquisition of brain structural, diffusion and functional sequences using 3 Tesla MRI. Study outcomes are neurocognitive, psychopathological and MRI measures.              Ethics and dissemination:                    This study has been approved by the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics and The Danish Data Protection Agency. The study is conducted in accordance with the guiding principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Parents gave written informed consent before enrolment.",-1
The role of circRNAs in the regulation of myocardial angiogenesis in coronary heart disease,"During myocardial ischemia, timely reperfusion is critical to limit infarct area and the overall loss of cardiac contractile function. New treatment strategies need to be developed for patients who are neither able to receive interventional treatment nor suitable for surgical blood transport reconstruction surgery. Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising approach that can be used to guide new treatment strategies. The goal of these therapies is to form new blood vessels or promote the maturation of existing vasculature systems, bypassing blocked arteries to maintain organ perfusion, thereby relieving symptoms and preventing the remodeling of bad organs. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been attracted much attention for their roles in various physiological and pathological processes. There is growing evidence that ncRNAs, especially circRNAs, play an important role in the regulation of cardiomyopathy angiogenesis due to its diversity of functions. Therefore, this article reviews the role and mechanisms of circRNA in myocardial angiogenesis to better understand the role of circRNA in myocardial angiogenesis, which may provide useful insights and new revelations for the research field of identifying diagnostic markers and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of coronary artery disease.",-1
Optimized Collaborative Brain-Computer Interfaces for Enhancing Face Recognition,"The aim of this study is to maximize group decision performance by optimally adapting EEG confidence decoders to the group composition. We train linear support vector machines to estimate the decision confidence of human participants from their EEG activity. We then simulate groups of different size and membership by combining individual decisions using a weighted majority rule. The weights assigned to each participant in the group are chosen solving a small-dimension, mixed, integer linear programming problem, where we maximize the group performance on the training set. We therefore introduce optimized collaborative brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where the decisions of each team member are weighted according to both the individual neural activity and the group composition. We validate this approach on a face recognition task undertaken by 10 human participants. The results show that optimal collaborative BCIs significantly enhance team performance over other BCIs, while improving fairness within the group. This research paves the way for practical applications of collaborative BCIs to realistic scenarios characterized by stable teams, where optimizing the decision policy of a single group may lead to significant long-term benefits of team dynamics.",-1
"Non-B, Non-C Hepatocellular Carcinoma in an HBV- and HCV-Endemic Area: A Community-Based Prospective Longitudinal Study","A large community cohort of adults who participated in a health screening program from 2003 to 2013 were prospectively analyzed for the risk factors of non-B, non-C (NBNC) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The serostatus of hepatitis B and C of 52,642 participants was linked to the mortality and cancer registration data of the Health and Welfare Data Science Center, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taiwan. During a median follow-up of 6 years, 35 of the 43,545 participants who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody developed HCC. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that old age (hazard ratio, 95% CI: 1.058, 1.019-1.098, p = 0.003); male sex (2.446, 1.200-4.985, p = 0.014); high aspartate aminotransferase levels (6.816, 2.945-15.779, p &lt; 0.001); fibrosis index based on four factor score (1.262, 1.154-1.381, p &lt; 0.001); blood sugar (1.009, 1.002-1.015, p = 0.006); and alpha-fetoprotein â?5 ng/mL (143.938, 43.094-480.760, p &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for HCC. By contrast, triglyceride &gt;150 mg/dL was associated with a decreased risk of HCC (0.216, 0.074-0.625, p = 0.005). This prospective community-based study provided insights into the potential HCC risk factors which may shed some light in HCC prevention and screening.",-1
Predictive models in SMA II natural history trajectories using machine learning: A proof of concept study,"It is known from previous literature that type II Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients generally, after the age of 5 years, presents a steep deterioration until puberty followed by a relative stability, as most abilities have been lost. Although it is possible to identify points of slope indicating early improvement, steep decline and relative stabilizations, there is still a lot of variability within each age group and it's not always possible to predict individual trajectories of progression from age only. The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model based on machine learning using an XGBoost algorithm for regression and report, explore and quantify, in a single centre longitudinal natural history study, the influence of clinical variables on the 6/12-months Hammersmith Motor Functional Scale Expanded score prediction (HFMSE). This study represents the first approach to artificial intelligence and trained models for the prediction of individualized trajectories of HFMSE disease progression using individual characteristics of the patient. The application of this method to larger cohorts may allow to identify different classes of progression, a crucial information at the time of the new commercially available therapies.",-1
Insoluble yeast Î²-glucan attenuates high-fat diet-induced obesity by regulating gut microbiota and its metabolites,"Emerging evidence suggests that insoluble dietary fiber prevents obesity by regulating gut dysbiosis. However, whether insoluble yeast Î²-glucan (IYG) has an anti-obesity effect is still unclear. Here, the impact and potential mechanism of long-term IYG supplementation on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity were investigated. After 24 weeks of long-term supplementation, IYG ameliorated weight gain, dyslipidemia, systemic inflammation, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in HFD-fed rats. In addition, HFD-induced gut dysbiosis and changed levels of short-chain fatty acids and lipopolysaccharide were restored by IYG. Meanwhile, HFD-induced downregulations of tight junction proteins and Mucin 2 as well as elevated gut permeability were recovered by IYG. IYG also mitigated HFD-induced colonic inflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, antibiotic treatment abrogated the protective effect of IYG on obesity, indicating the important role of gut microbiota in IYG's effect. This study demonstrated that IYG, as a potential prebiotic, exhibited a protective effect on HFD-induced obesity.",-1
"FTACMT study protocol: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of faecal microbiota transplantation for autism spectrum disorder","Introduction:                    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complicated diffuse developmental disorder that commonly involves gastrointestinal distress and dysbacteriosis. Emerging lines of evidence have shown faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to be a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the clinical outcomes of patients with ASD by re-establishing their intestinal microflora. We are undertaking the first-ever multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial of FMT for the treatment of children with both ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms and will assess the feasibility and efficacy outcomes of this strategy.              Methods:                    In total, 318 children with both ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms will be enrolled (from 15 hospitals in China) to receive either FMT intervention (n=212) or a placebo (control, n=106). Children aged 3-6 years will take two capsules two times a day, and those older than 6 years will take three capsules two times a day. Each patient will receive four treatment courses, with each 12-day course being repeated every month. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, throughout the period of intervention, and at subsequent follow-ups for 2 months. The primary trial objective is to investigate the remodelling effect of FMT on the intestinal microflora in patients with ASD. The secondary objective focuses on the clinical efficacy and safety of FMT, including its improvement of the clinical response and metabonomics.              Ethics and dissemination:                    Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital Ethics Committee of each Faecal Transfer for ASD China Multicenter Trial Working Group. The ongoing FMT clinical trial is intended to support the approval of the new technology and its administration. The results of this trial will provide high-quality evidence to inform the future clinical application of this new therapy.

Gene Expression Profiling of the Habenula in Rats Exposed to Chronic Restraint Stress,"Chronic stress contributes to the risk of developing depression; the habenula, a nucleus in epithalamus, is associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders. Using genome-wide gene expression analysis, we analyzed the transcriptome of the habenula in rats exposed to chronic restraint stress for 14 days. We identified 379 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were affected by chronic stress. These genes were enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signaling pathway, circadian entrainment, and synaptic signaling from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and responded to corticosteroids, positive regulation of lipid transport, anterograde trans-synaptic signaling, and chemical synapse transmission from the Gene Ontology analysis. Based on protein-protein interaction network analysis of the DEGs, we identified neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, circadian entrainment, and cholinergic synapse-related subclusters. Additionally, cell type and habenular regional expression of DEGs, evaluated using a recently published single-cell RNA sequencing study (GSE137478), strongly suggest that DEGs related to neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and trans-synaptic signaling are highly enriched in medial habenular neurons. Taken together, our findings provide a valuable set of molecular targets that may play important roles in mediating the habenular response to stress and the onset of chronic stress-induced depressive behaviors.",-1
Changes in biochemical parameters by gender and time: Effect of short-term vegan diet adherence,"Background:                    Vegetarian diets adapted for various reasons that may include religious, ethical, and health considerations have reasonable health benefits including weight loss, and favorable metabolic changes. However, studies that assessed health benefits associated with vegan diet practices during the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian (EOC) Lenten fasting remains limited. This study has, therefore, assessed how short-term vegan diet associated with metabolic traits, including weight, body mass index (BMI), circumference, blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), through longitudinal cross-sectional study design.              Methods:                    Seventy-five subjects (34 females and 41 males) with a mean age of [+SD] 27.3 + 5.8 years (range, 18 and 35) took part in the study. The study followed three assessment sessions: at baseline, during the Lenten (week 7), and 7 weeks after the end of the Lenten (week 14). An automatic chemistry analyzer (Mindray, BE-2000, China) used for lipid profile analysis. We used paired sample t-test in pre and post-performance and repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc adjustment between time points. The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.              Results:                    The EOC fasting with vegan diet induced significantly lower blood pressure, weight, BMI, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TC: HDL-C ratios, during Lenten (that is vegan diet consumption), but a regain noted in these parameters 7-weeks after Lenten (that is omnivore diet). On gender differences, vegan diet associated with significantly lower blood pressure, TC, and LDL-C in females compared with age-matched male counterparts. Some methodological limitations of this study are discussed with particular reference to lack of a randomized control group and self-reported data that limit this study in establishing a causal relationship through observed associations.              Conclusions:                    Vegan diet consumption even for short period corroborate ideal metabolic traits, with more favorable changes noted in women than age-matched men counterparts. These findings might help to define vegetarian diets as part of religious fasting (beyond its spiritual goals) as a non-pharmacological prescription in different populations, and our findings add to growing evidence in these subjects.",-1
Predictive Factors in the Appearance and Evolution of Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Oral Cavity,"Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) registered an alarming fall in the average age of individuals diagnosed in the last decade. Objectives: The aim of our study is to assess the main risk factors for OSCC specific to Romania and to identify patients at risk for this pathology. The purpose is to implement in the future a screening and early diagnosis program for OSCC in our country. Materials and Methods: A ten-year case-control study was conducted on patients selected from ""St. Spiridon"" Hospital-IaÅi, Romania. The study contained 1780 individuals diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Results: For the patients under 46 years old: APC = -2.8 percent (95% CI: -24.4 to -7.1; p = 0.0012), with the observed rate of 30.18 percent. The incidence increased in patients aged 46 to 49 years (APC = 9.6%; 95% CI: 6.7 to -10.4; p = 0.0081). For the age group 49 to 64 years old: APC = -2.4 percent (95% CI: -5.3 to -1.6, p = 0.1239). For the age group 64-74: APC = -4.6, (95% CI: 1.4 to 6.9, p = 0.0108). The incidence of incidents was lower in the age group 74-80 (p = 0.0025). For the age group 80-91: APC = 8.1 (95% CI: 6.4 to 14.2, p = 0.0024), with the incidence of cases: APC = 8.1 (95% CI: 6.4 to 14.2, p = 0.0024). Univariate analysis revealed a substantially higher risk of developing oral carcinoma in males (OR = 4.43; CI: 3.84 to 5.80). Age above 60, cigarette usage and alcohol abuse are significant risk factors for OSCC. Patients with lymph node dissemination, ulcero-vegetant form, stages II and IV, whose therapeutic approach consisted of radiotherapy and chemotherapy or radiotherapy only had a worse rate of survival at 24 months post-therapy. Conclusions: Our study highlights the increase in the incidence of OSCC in Romania during the research period, the decrease in the average age of diagnosed patients, as well as the degree to which the studied population is exposed to the main risk factors specific to this geographical area.",-1
Fasting Ghrelin and Postprandial GLP-1 Levels in Patients With Morbid Obesity and Medical Comorbidities After Sleeve Gastrectomy and One-anastomosis Gastric Bypass: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Background:                    Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) are among the commonly performed bariatric procedures. This randomized study aimed to compare SG and OAGB in terms of weight loss, improvement in comorbidities, and change in serum ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels.              Patients and methods:                    This was a prospective randomized trial on patients with morbid obesity associated with medical comorbidities who were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 equal groups; group I underwent SG and group II underwent OAGB. Outcome measures were percent of excess weight loss (%EWL), improvement in comorbidities, change in the venous levels of fasting ghrelin and postprandial GLP-1 at 12 months after surgery, in addition to operation time and complications.              Results:                    Forty patients (38 female) of a mean age of 33.8 years and mean body mass index of 48.6 kg/m2 were included. Operation time in group II was significantly longer than in group I (86 vs. 52.87 min; P<0.001). There were 6 recorded complications (1 in group I and 5 in group II, P=0.18). The %EWL, %total weight loss, and %excess body mass index loss at 6 and 12 months postoperatively were significantly higher in group II than in group I. Both groups had similar rates of improvement in comorbidities. Group I had significantly lower ghrelin and GLP-1 levels postoperatively at 6 and 12 months, respectively, as compared with group II.              Conclusions:                    OAGB was associated with significantly higher EWL than SG. The reduction in fasting ghrelin and postprandial GLP-1 serum levels at 12 months after SG was significantly higher than that after OAGB.",-1
Early life Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG colonisation inhibits intestinal tumour formation,"Background:                    Gut microbiota dysbiosis is closely related to the progression of colorectal cancer. Our previous study revealed that early life colonisation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) had long-term positive effects on health. We sought to investigate whether early life LGG colonisation could inhibit intestinal tumour formation in offspring.              Methods:                    Adult C57BL/6 female mice were mated with Apcmin/+ male mice. Pregnant mice with the same conception date received 108 cfu live or fixed LGG from day 18 of pregnancy until natural delivery. After genotyping, offspring mice received 107 cfu of live or fixed LGG for 0-5 days after birth.              Results:                    Early life LGG colonisation significantly promoted intestinal development, inhibited low-grade intestinal inflammation and altered the gut microbiota composition of offspring in the weaning period (3 week old). Notably, early life LGG colonisation reduced the multiplicity of intestinal tumours in adulthood (12 week old), possibly due to inhibition of Wnt signalling and promotion of tumour cell apoptosis. Importantly, at the genus level, Bifidobacterium and Anaeroplasma with potential anti-tumour effects were increased in adulthood, while Peptostreptococcus, which potentially contributes to tumour formation, was decreased.              Conclusions:                    Early life LGG colonisation inhibited the intestinal tumour formation of offspring in adulthood.",-1
Pleomorphic Adenoma of Minor Salivary Gland,"Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor of salivary glands, arising from minor salivary glands, is very rare and presents with a minor female predilection; and the highest occurrence is between the fourth and sixth decades of life. It is of glandular origin, usually presenting as a slowly growing, painless, firm swelling that does not cause ulceration of the overlying mucosa. In this case, a 27-year male presented with swelling on buccal mucosa for three years. The swelling was firm and well circumscribed. Excisional biopsy was done under general anesthesia and the mass was excised. The histopathological evaluation revealed pleomorphic adenoma. This case highlights the need to keep this entity in the differential diagnosis of intra-oral indolent swellings of some duration. Key Words: Pleomorphic adenoma, Buccal mucosa, Minor salivary glands.",-1
Dietary Protein Patterns during Pregnancy Are Associated with Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Chinese Pregnant Women,"Controversies around the association between dietary protein intake and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) persist. To the best of our knowledge, this association has not previously been reported from the perspective of dietary protein patterns. We aimed to investigate the relationship between dietary protein patterns and GDM risk in pregnant women, and 1014 pregnant women (20-28 weeks of gestation) were recruited in Guangzhou, China, during 2017-2018. Maternal dietary information was collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire, which covered the most common foods consumed in Guangzhou, China. GDM was identified by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test. A K-means cluster analysis was conducted to aggregate individuals into three groups, which were determined by the major sources of protein. Logistic regression was employed to explore the relationship between dietary protein patterns and the risk of GDM. Among the 1014 participants, 191 (18.84%) were diagnosed with GDM. In the total population, when comparing the highest quartile with the lowest, we found that total protein and animal protein intake increased the risk of GDM with the adjusted odds ratios (95%CI) being 6.27, 5.43 (1.71-23.03, 1.71-17.22), respectively. Pregnant women were further divided into three dietary protein patterns, namely, white meat, plant-dairy-eggs, and red meat protein patterns. Compared to women with the plant-dairy-eggs protein pattern, those with the red meat protein pattern (OR: 1.80; 95%CI: 1.06-3.07) or white meat protein pattern (OR: 1.83; 95%CI: 1.04-3.24) had an increased risk of GDM. Higher dietary intakes of total or animal protein during mid-pregnancy were related to an increased risk of GDM. Furthermore, we first found that, compared to women with the plant-dairy-eggs protein pattern, women with the red meat or white meat protein patterns had a higher risk of GDM.",-1
Exposure to microplastics reduces the bioaccumulation of sulfamethoxazole but enhances its effects on gut microbiota and the antibiotic resistome of mice,"Microplastics (MPs) have aroused a global health concern and their coexistence with antibiotics is inevitable. However, how MPs would affect the bioaccumulation and risks of antibiotics in humans remains poorly understood. Here a mouse model was used, and through dietary exposure, we observed that while the relative distributions of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in tissues were relatively stable, MPs significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX in mice tissues (liver, lung, spleen, heart and kidney). Notably, while SMX and MPs showed a differential effect, MPs could exacerbate the effects of SMX on gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profile, with the relative abundances of sulfonamide resistance genes and multidrug genes being significantly increased. We further identified that shifts in gut microbiota contributed to the changes in ARG profiles in mice. Combined, our results demonstrate that MPs reduced the bioaccumulation of SMX, but they enhanced its effects on gut microbiota and the antibiotic resistome of mice, indicating they might have high risks to humans.",-1
Integrative Analysis Revealing Human Adipose-Specific Genes and Consolidating Obesity Loci,"Identification of adipose-specific genes has contributed to an understanding of mechanisms underlying adipocyte development and obesity. Herein, our analyses of the recent Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database revealed 38 adipose-specific/enhanced protein coding genes, among which 3 genes were novel adipose-specific, and 414 highly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subcutaneous and omental adipose depots. By integrative analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), 14 adipose-specific/enhanced genes and 60 DEGs were found to be associated with obesity-related traits and diseases, consolidating evidence for contribution of these genes to the regional fat distribution and obesity phenotypes. In addition, expression of HOXC cluster was up-regulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and the majority of the HOXB cluster was expressed highly in omental adipose tissue, indicating differential expression patterns of HOX clusters in adipose depots. Our findings on the distinct gene expression profiles in adipose tissue and their relation to obesity provide an important foundation for future functional biological studies and therapeutic targets in obesity and associated diseases.",-1
Construction of miRNA-regulated drug-pathway network to screen drug repurposing candidates for multiple sclerosis,"Given the high disability rate of multiple sclerosis (MS), there is a need for safer and more effective therapeutic agents. Existing literature highlights the prominent roles of miRNA in MS pathophysiology. Nevertheless, there are few studies that have explored the usefulness of existing drugs in treating MS through potential miRNA-modulating abilities.The current investigation identifies genes that may exacerbate the risk of MS due to their respective miRNA associations. These findings were then used to determine potential drug candidates through the construction of miRNA-regulated drug-pathway network through genes. We uncovered a total of 48 MS risk pathways, 133 MS risk miRNAs, and 186 drugs that can affect these pathways. Potential MS risk miRNAs that are also regulated by therapeutic candidates were hsa05215 and hsa05152. We analyzed the properties of the miRNA-regulated drug-pathway network through genes and uncovered a number of novel MS agents by assessing their respective Z-values.A total of 20 likely drug candidates were identified, including human immunoglobulin, aspirin, alemtuzumab, minocycline, abciximab, alefacept, palivizumab, bevacizumab, efalizumab, tositumomab, minocycline, etanercept, catumaxomab, and sarilumab. Each of these agents were then explored with regards to their likely mechanism of action in treating MS.The current investigation provides a fresh perspective on MS biological mechanisms as well as likely treatment strategies.",-1
Circ_RPPH1 regulates glioma cell malignancy by binding to miR-627-5p/miR-663a to induce SDC1 expression,"Background:                    Recent studies revealed the key role of circular RNA (circRNA) in glioma progression. However, the effect of circ_0000520, also named as circRNA ribonuclease P RNA component H1 (circ_RPPH1), in glioma development was unknown. The study aimed to reveal the role of circ_RPPH1 in glioma cell malignancy.              Methods:                    Human astrocytes (NHA) and glioma cell lines (A172 and U251) were employed in this study. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to check the expression of circ_RPPH1, microRNA-627-5p (miR-627-5p), miR-663a and syndecan 1 (SDC1). Immunohistochemistry assay was conducted to assess the protein expression of nuclear proliferation marker ki67 and matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP9). Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry analysis, 5-Ethynyl-29-deoxyuridine, or cell colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell assays. The interaction between miRNAs (miR-627-5p and miR-663a) and circ_RPPH1 or SDC1 was identified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. A mouse model assay was performed to reveal the impact of circ_RPPH1 knockdown on glioma cell malignancy in vivo by analyzing neoplasm volume and weight.              Results:                    Circ_RPPH1 and SDC1 expression were significantly increased, whereas miR-627-5p and miR-663a expression were decreased in glioma tissues and cells in comparison with healthy brain tissues or human astrocytes. Circ_RPPH1 depletion led to the decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and the increased cell apoptosis. Additionally, circ_RPPH1 bound to miR-627-5p/miR-663a and mediated glioma cell processes by interacting with them. SDC1 overexpression attenuated miR-627-5p/miR-663a-mediated actions. Moreover, circ_RPPH1 regulated SDC1 expression through interaction with miR-627-5p and/or miR-663a. Furthermore, circ_RPPH1 knockdown inhibited glioma cell malignancy in vivo, accompanied by the decreases of ki67 and MMP9 expression.              Conclusion:                    Circ_RPPH1 knockdown inhibited glioma tumorigenesis by downregulating SDC1 by binding to miR-627-5p/miR-663a, showing that circ_RPPH1 might be an effective therapeutic target for glioma.",-1
Crocin attenuates NF-ÎºB-mediated inflammation and proliferation in breast cancer cells by down-regulating PRKCQ,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer confronting women worldwide. Crocin, a glycosylated carotenoid extracted from Crocus sativus L., possesses anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. This study tried to explore the influences of crocin on proliferation and inflammation of BC cells, and to investigate the possible mechanism. The protein levels of protein kinase C theta (PRKCQ) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) p-p65 and p65 were examined using western blot analysis. The potential targets of crocin were predicted using the PharmMapper database. Cell viability and proliferation were determined utilizing CCK-8 and EdU incorporation assays, respectively. Inflammation was assessed by detecting the levels of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) using RT-qPCR and ELISA. Results showed that crocin inhibited NF-ÎºB activation and suppressed cell viability and proliferation in BC cells. Crocin caused a significant reduction of levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², suggesting that crocin suppressed inflammation in BC cells. NF-ÎºB inhibition decreased proliferation and inflammation in BC cells. Additionally, PRKCQ was identified as a potential target of crocin according to PharmMapper database. Crocin treatment inhibited the activation of NF-ÎºB in BC cells by reducing PRKCQ expression. Mechanistically, PRKCQ-dependent activation of NF-ÎºB pathway reversed the effects of crocin on the proliferation and inflammation in BC cells. In conclusion, crocin inhibited NF-ÎºB-mediated inflammation and proliferation in BC cells through reducing PRKCQ expression.",-1
"Gut Microbiome Composition Is Predictive of Incident Type 2 Diabetes in a Population Cohort of 5,572 Finnish Adults","Objective:                    To examine the previously unknown long-term association between gut microbiome composition and incident type 2 diabetes in a representative population cohort.              Research design and methods:                    We collected fecal samples from 5,572 Finns (mean age 48.7 years; 54.1% women) in 2002 who were followed up for incident type 2 diabetes until 31 December 2017. The samples were sequenced using shotgun metagenomics. We examined associations between gut microbiome composition and incident diabetes using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. We first used the eastern Finland subpopulation to obtain initial findings and validated these in the western Finland subpopulation.              Results:                    Altogether, 432 cases of incident diabetes occurred over the median follow-up of 15.8 years. We detected four species and two clusters consistently associated with incident diabetes in the validation models. These four species were Clostridium citroniae (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21; 95% CI 1.04-1.42), C. bolteae (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.04-1.39), Tyzzerella nexilis (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.01-1.36), and Ruminococcus gnavus (HR 1.17; 95% CI 1.01-1.36). The positively associated clusters, cluster 1 (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.02-1.38) and cluster 5 (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.02-1.36), mostly consisted of these same species.              Conclusions:                    We observed robust species-level taxonomic features predictive of incident type 2 diabetes over long-term follow-up. These findings build on and extend previous mainly cross-sectional evidence and further support links between dietary habits, metabolic diseases, and type 2 diabetes that are modulated by the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome can potentially be used to improve disease prediction and uncover novel therapeutic targets for diabetes.",-1
HDL Subclass Distribution Shifts with Increasing Central Adiposity,"Although cross-sectional studies have shown that obesity is associated with lower concentrations of large high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses, it is unknown if changes in HDL subclasses are related to changes in body fat and its distribution over time. We therefore assessed changes in HDL subclass distribution over a 5.5-year free-living follow-up period in 24 black South African women. At baseline and follow-up, body composition and body fat distribution were measured using anthropometry, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and computerized tomography. HDL subclass distribution was quantified using LipoprintÂ®. Over the 5.5-year follow-up period, body fat (+17.3 Â± 4.5 kg, p < 0.05) and trunk fat mass (+7.4 Â± 1.9%, % fat mass, FM, p < 0.05) increased, while leg fat mass (-2.53 Â± 0.56%, % FM, p < 0.001) and the distribution of large (-6.43 Â± 2.12%, p < 0.05) HDL subclasses decreased. A percentage decrease in large HDL subclasses was associated with a percentage increase in central fat mass (visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area, p < 0.05) and a percentage decrease in peripheral fat mass (leg fat mass). These preliminary findings suggest that a relative redistribution of body fat from the periphery to the abdominal region were associated with a decrease HDL subclass size in black South African women and provide a novel link between body fat distribution and lipidology in this population.",-1
Bioequivalence and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Two Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets Under Fasting and Fed Conditions in Healthy Chinese Volunteers,"This article aims to assess the bioequivalence of the test and the reference metformin hydrochloride tablets in healthy Chinese volunteers under fasting and fed conditions and to explore the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of both formulations. In total, 56 healthy Chinese subjects (28 in each group) were enrolled in this randomized, open, single-center, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, 2-cycle cross clinical trial. The subjects were administrated a single dose of the test and the reference tablets at 0.25 g with a 7-day washout. Venous blood samples of all subjects were taken from predose 0 hour to postdose 24 hours according to the planned times. PK parameters for metformin were analyzed and calculated with noncompartmental methods. There were no significant differences in the PK parameters between the 2 formulations under both the fasting and the fed states. The 90% confidence intervals of 2 formulations were within 80.00%-125.00% based on Cmax , AUC0-t , and AUC0-â?under both conditions. High-fat and high-calorie diets delayed the Tmax and reduced the AUC0-t and AUC0-â?. No severe adverse events occurred in this study. Two metformin hydrochloride tablets were bioequivalent under both fasting and fed states; the high-fat and high-calorie diet could lower the rate and extent of absorption of metformin in healthy Chinese volunteers.",-1
Handgrip strength attenuates the adverse effects of overweight on cardiometabolic risk factors among collegiate students but not in individuals with higher fat levels,"The aims of this study are to (i) examine a clustered metabolic syndrome composite score (MetScore) and fatness among college students across body mass index (BMI) categories, and (ii) determine whether fit individuals have lower MetScores, fewer individual metabolic syndrome components, and lower fatness than unfit individuals across BMI categories. A total of 1,795 participants aged >18 years who participated in The FUPRECOL Study were selected for the present analyses. Handgrip strength was tested by a grip dynamometer and used to classify adults as fit or unfit. Among all participants, MetScore, percentage of body fat, and visceral adiposity increased linearly across the BMI categories among college students (all P < 0.001). Individuals who were overweight and fit had a lower MetScore (-0.6 SD; P = 0.02), body fat percentage (-2.6%; P < 0.001) and visceral adiposity (-0.2; P = 0.01) than unfit peers. Moderately fit obese individuals had significantly lower visceral fat levels than unfit obese peers (-3.0; P = 0.03). These results suggest that having adequate handgrip strength-a proxy of overall strength capacity-may attenuate obesity-related cardiometabolic risk. Moreover, weight loss should be recommended to all individuals with obesity, even among those who are currently considered fit.",-1
Transgenerational exposure to warming reduces the sensitivity to a pesticide under warming,"Despite the increased attention for temporal aspects of stressor interactions and for effects of warming in ecotoxicological studies, we lack knowledge on how different exposure durations to warming may affect pesticide sensitivity. We tested how three types of exposure duration to 4 Â°C warming (acute, developmental and transgenerational exposure to 24 Â°C vs 20 Â°C) shape the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos on two ecologically relevant fitness-related traits of mosquito larvae: heat tolerance and antipredator behaviour. Transgenerational (from the parental generation) and developmental (from the egg stage) warming appeared energetically more stressful than acute warming (from the final instar), because (i) only the latter resulted in an adaptive increase of heat tolerance, and (ii) especially developmental and transgenerational warming reduced the diving responsiveness and diving time. Exposure to chlorpyrifos decreased the heat tolerance, diving responsiveness and diving time. The impact of chlorpyrifos was lower at 24 Â°C than at 20 Â°C indicating that the expected increase in toxicity at 24 Â°C was overruled by the observed increase in pesticide degradation. Notably, although our results suggest that transgenerational warming was energetically more stressful, it did reduce the chlorpyrifos-induced negative effects at 24 Â°C on heat tolerance and the alarm escape response compared to acute warming. Our results provide important evidence that the exposure duration to warming may determine the impact of a pesticide under warming, thereby identifying a novel temporal aspect of stressor interactions in risk assessment.",-1
Pyrethrins elicit olfactory response and spatial repellency in Aedes albopictus,"Background:                    Pyrethrum from dry flowers of Chrysanthemum is a well-known botanical insecticide and repellent. Its insecticidal activity attributes to its six insecticidal esters, collectively known as pyrethrins. Pyrethrins and its synthetic analogs pyrethroids exert their toxic action by modifying the function of voltage-gated sodium channels. Aside from insecticidal activity, pyrethrum has also been used to repel mosquitoes for centuries. Today, pyrethrum continues to be used as an active ingredient in mosquito coils and other mosquito-repellent devices globally. However, the mechanism of pyrethrum repellency remains largely unknown.              Results:                    Here we report that pyrethrum vapor induced spatial (non-contact) repellency in Aedes albopictus, a major vector of dengue and West Nile viruses. Using electroantennogram (EAG) recordings from adult antennae, we found that pyrethrum elicited EAG response in a dose-dependent manner. We then isolated the six insecticidal esters, pyrethrins I and II, cinerins I and II, jasmolins I and II from pyrethrum extract and discovered that five of the six esters, except jasmolin I, all elicited EAG responses. Furthermore, pyrethrins I and II, cinerin II and jasmolin II induced repellency, whereas cinerin I and jasmolin I did not.              Conclusion:                    Of the six pyrethrins, four of them, pyrethrins I and II, cinerin II and jasmolin II, activate olfactory-receptor neurons and elicit spatial repellency in Ae. albopictus. Our study provided a foundation for future structure-function studies of pyrethrins, their cognate olfactory receptors and efficacies of repellency and for the development of new and more effective mosquito repellents for controlling vector-borne human diseases.

Plant secondary compound- and antibiotic-induced community disturbances improve the establishment of foreign gut microbiota,"Fecal transplants are a powerful tool for manipulating the gut microbial community, but how these non-native communities establish in the presence of an intact host gut microbiome is poorly understood. We explored the microbiome of desert woodrats (Neotoma lepida) to determine whether disrupting existing microbial communities using plant secondary compounds (PSCs) or antibiotics increases the establishment of foreign microbes. We administered two fecal transplants between natural populations of adult woodrats that harbor distinct gut microbiota and have different natural dietary exposure to PSCs. First, we administered fecal transplants to recipients given creosote resin, a toxin found in the natural diet of our ""donor"" population, and compared the gut microbial communities to animals given fecal transplants and control diet using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Second, we disrupted the gut microbial community of the same recipients with an antibiotic prior to fecal transplants. We found that gut microbial communities of woodrats disrupted with PSCs or antibiotics resembled that of donors more closely than control groups. PSC treatment also enriched microbes associated with metabolizing dietary toxins in transplant recipients. These results demonstrate that microbial community disturbances by PSCs or antibiotics are sufficient to facilitate establishment of foreign microbes in animals with intact microbiomes.",-1
The Profile of MicroRNA Expression and Potential Role in the Regulation of Drug-Resistant Genes in Doxorubicin and Topotecan Resistant Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines,"Epithelial ovarian cancer has the highest mortality among all gynecological malignancies. The main reasons for high mortality are late diagnosis and development of resistance to chemotherapy. Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs can result from altered expression of drug-resistance genes regulated by miRNA. The main goal of our study was to detect differences in miRNA expression levels in two doxorubicin (DOX)- and two topotecan (TOP)-resistant variants of the A2780 drug-sensitive ovarian cancer cell line by miRNA microarray. The next aim was to recognize miRNAs as factors responsible for the regulation of drug-resistance genes. We observed altered expression of 28 miRNA that may be related to drug resistance. The upregulation of miR-125b-5p and miR-935 and downregulation of miR-218-5p was observed in both DOX-resistant cell lines. In both TOP-resistant cell lines, we noted the overexpression of miR-99a-5p, miR-100-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-125b-2-3p and decreased expression of miR-551b-3p, miR-551b-5p, and miR-383-5p. Analysis of the targets suggested that expression of important drug-resistant genes such as the collagen type I alpha 2 chain (COL1A2), protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type K (PTPRK), receptor tyrosine kinase-EPHA7, Roundabout Guidance Receptor 2 (ROBO2), myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCK), and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) can be regulated by miRNA.",-1
Parallel Machine Learning for Forecasting the Dynamics of Complex Networks,"Forecasting the dynamics of large, complex, sparse networks from previous time series data is important in a wide range of contexts. Here we present a machine learning scheme for this task using a parallel architecture that mimics the topology of the network of interest. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of our method implemented using reservoir computing on a chaotic network of oscillators. Two levels of prior knowledge are considered: (i) the network links are known, and (ii) the network links are unknown and inferred via a data-driven approach to approximately optimize prediction.",-1
Handgrip Strength Values Depend on Tumor Entity and Predict 180-Day Mortality in Malnourished Cancer Patients,"Background:                    Cancer-related malnutrition is a prevalent condition associated with a loss of muscle mass and impaired functional status, leading to immunodeficiency, impaired quality of life and adverse clinical outcomes. Handgrip strength (HGS) is a practical measure to assess muscle strength in individual patients during clinical practice. However, HGS reference values refer to populations of healthy people, and population-specific values, such as those in the population of cancer patients, still need to be defined.              Methods:                    Within a secondary analysis of a previous randomized controlled nutritional trial focusing on hospitalized cancer patients at risk for malnutrition, we investigated sex-specific HGS values stratified by age and tumor entity. Additionally, we examined the association between HGS and 180-day all-cause mortality.              Results:                    We included data from 628 cancer patients, which were collected from eight hospitals in Switzerland. Depending on the age of patients, HGS varied among female patients from 7 kg to 26 kg and among male patients from 20.5 kg to 44 kg. An incremental decrease in handgrip strength by 10 kg resulted in a 50% increase in 180-day all-cause mortality (odds ratio 1.52 (95%CI 1.19 to 1.94), p = 0.001).              Conclusion:                    Our data provide evidence of the prognostic implications of HGS measurement in cancer patients and validate the prognostic value of handgrip strength in regard to long-term mortality. In addition, our results provide expected HGS values in the population of hospitalized malnourished cancer patients, which may allow better interpretation of values in individual patients.",-1
Autonomic nervous system activity predicts increasing serum cytokines in children,"Systemic inflammation is associated with increased risk for prevalent and costly diseases, and animal models implicate the autonomic nervous system in the control of inflammatory processes. In humans, research on autonomic-immune connections has been much more limited, and has focused on single branch autonomic measures (i.e., either parasympathetic or sympathetic). The current study utilized cardiac autonomic balance (CAB), derived from dual-branch cardiac autonomic recordings, to test the relation between resting autonomic function and inflammatory reactivity to challenge in children.              Methods:                    Participants included 96 children (51 boys, 45 girls) ages 9-11 years (mean age = 9.93 years, SD = 0.57 years). CAB values were calculated from standardized measures of parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, namely resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia and pre-ejection period data, respectively. Children provided two blood samples, one before and one following exposure to an acute social stressor or control condition. Serum was assayed for four cytokines that orchestrate inflammation: interleukin-6 (IL6), interleukin-8 (IL8), interleukin-10 (IL10), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa).              Results:                    We discovered large individual differences in inflammatory marker production across children, and no average main effect of stress condition. CAB significantly predicted these individual differences, such that children lower on CAB showed increasing serum cytokines from time 1 to time 2. In contrast, children with greater CAB tended to show declining inflammatory markers across the session.              Discussion:                    Low cardiac autonomic balance (i.e., the combination of low parasympathetic and high sympathetic activity) may be a useful marker of proinflammatory tendencies in children, suggesting novel paths for early risk detection and intervention.",-1
Synthesis of PP2A-Activating PF-543 Derivatives and Investigation of Their Inhibitory Effects on Pancreatic Cancer Cells,"Sphingosine kinase (SK) is involved in the growth of cells, including cancer cells. However, which of its two isotypes-SK1 and SK2-is more favorable for cancer growth remains unclear. Although PF-543 strongly and selectively inhibits SK1, its anticancer effect is not high, and the underlying reason remains difficult to explain. We previously determined that the tail group of PF-543 is responsible for its low metabolic stability (MS). In this study, compounds containing aromatic or aliphatic tails in the triazole group were synthesized, and changes in the SK-inhibitory effect and anticancer activity of PF-543 were assessed using pancreatic cancer cells. The compounds with aliphatic tails showed high inhibitory effects on pancreatic cancer cells but slightly lower selectivity for SK1. A compound with an introduced aliphatic tail activated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), showing an effect similar to that of FTY720. Molecular docking analysis revealed that the PP2A-binding form of this newly synthesized compound was different from that noted in the case of FTY720. This compound also improved the MS of PF-543. These results indicate that the tail structure of PF-543 influences MS.",-1
Accuracy of deep learning-based integrated tooth models by merging intraoral scans and CBCT scans for 3D evaluation of root position during orthodontic treatment,"Objective:                    This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of deep learning-based integrated tooth models (ITMs) by merging intraoral scans and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans for three-dimensional (3D) evaluation of root position during orthodontic treatment and to compare the fabrication process of integrated tooth models (ITMs) with manual method.              Material and methods:                    Intraoral scans and corresponding CBCT scans before and after treatment were obtained from 15 patients who completed orthodontic treatment with premolar extraction. A total of 600 ITMs were generated using deep learning technology and manual methods by merging the intraoral scans and CBCT scans at pretreatment. Posttreatment intraoral scans were integrated into the tooth model, and the resulting estimated root positions were compared with the actual root position at posttreatment CBCT. Discrepancies between the estimated and actual root position including average surface differences, arch widths, inter-root distances, and root axis angles were obtained in both the deep learning and manual method, and these measurements were compared between the two methods.              Results:                    The average surface differences of estimated and actual ITMs in the manual method were 0.02 mm and 0.03 mm for the maxillary and mandibular arches, respectively. In the deep learning method, the discrepancies were 0.07 mm and 0.08 mm for the maxillary and mandibular arches, respectively. For the measurements of arch widths, inter-root distances, and root axis angles, there were no significant differences between estimated and actual models both in the manual and in the deep learning methods, except for some measurements. Comparing the two methods, only three measurements showed significant differences. The procedure times taken to obtain the measurements were longer in the manual method than in the deep learning method.              Conclusion:                    Both deep learning and manual methods showed similar accuracy in the integration of intraoral scans and CBCT images. Considering time and efficiency, the deep learning automatic method for ITMs is highly recommended for clinical practice.",-1
Polydatin Improves Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy by Activating Sirt1 and Reducing p38 Phosphorylation,"Introduction:                    Our previous study confirmed that polydatin (PD) can alleviate sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction (in the vascular endothelium, kidney, and small intestine) by activating Sirt1 and that PD protects against traumatic brain injury in rats via increased Sirt1 and inhibition of the p38-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We aim to investigate whether PD may also attenuate sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE).              Methods:                    In this study, we constructed an SAE mouse model by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and measured Sirt1 protein activity, p38 phosphorylation, brain tissue pathological damage, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6), mitochondrial function (mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP content, and reactive oxygen species), neurological function, and animal survival time. Sirt1 selective inhibitor Ex527 and p38 inhibitor SB203580 were used to explore the possible mechanism of PD in SAE.              Results:                    We confirmed that PD inhibits neuroinflammation evidenced by reduced proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, PD protects mitochondria as demonstrated by restored mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. As we expected, p38 inhibition reduces neuroinflammation and mitochondrial damage. In contrast, Sirt1 inhibition aggravates cerebral cortex mitochondrial damage and neuroinflammation and promotes phosphorylation of p38. Mechanistically, PD treatment suppressed p38 phosphorylation and consequently reduced the neuroinflammatory response, and these effects were blocked by the Sirt selective inhibitor Ex527.              Conclusions:                    This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate that PD alleviates SAE, at least partially, by upregulating Sir1-mediated neuroinflammation inhibition and mitochondrial function protection.",-1
Long-term exclusive enteral nutrition remodels the gut microbiota and alleviates TNBS-induced colitis in mice,"Background: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) provides an effective strategy for the induction of clinical remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. However, the feasibility of long-term EEN in the management of disease and the underlying mechanism whereby long-term EEN prevents intestinal inflammation are still not fully understood. Methods: Paired male and female adult wild-type (WT) mice were mated to breed littermates, and these pups were then weaned at 3 weeks of age and randomly allocated into regular diet (RT) feeding group and EEN feeding group (Peptisorb; NUTRICIA), respectively. After feeding until adulthood at the age of 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and phenotypic analysis of immune cells in spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) was performed by flow cytometry. Fecal pellets were also collected to determine the levels of immunoglobulins and gut microbiota by ELISA and 16S rRNA sequencing. The role of long-term EEN in the development of colitis and its underlying mechanisms were evaluated in a TNBS-induced colitis model in mice. Results: Feeding with EEN decreased the percentages of IgA- and IgG-coated bacteria and the levels of soluble IgA and IgG in the feces of EEN-feeding mice compared with the controls, but did not affect the compositions of different immune cells including CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B220+ B cells in the spleens and MLNs. An in-depth analysis of the gut microbiota revealed a decrease of the general diversity of the gut microbiota, but a significant change of the composition of the gut microbiota after EEN feeding, characterized by an increase of the beneficial bacteria including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Alistipes, but a decrease of the detrimental bacteria such as Escherichia-Shigella. Moreover, we found that EEN feeding markedly improved intestinal inflammation in the TNBS-induced colitis model compared to RT feeding, as evidenced by decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and fecal soluble immunoglobulins and improved microbial community composition. Conclusions: Our data indicate that long-term EEN feeding remodels the composition of gut microbiota and alleviates intestinal mucosal inflammation. It provides new guidance using EEN for the management of gut inflammation.",-1
"Necdin, one of the important pathway proteins in the regulation of osteosarcoma progression by microRNA-200c","MicroRNA-200c (miR-200c) generally acts as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancer types and a promising therapeutic target in tumorigenesis. However, only a few studies have explained the role of miR-200c in the development of osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we investigated the role of miR-200c in OS progression and identified the regulatory pathway protein NDN involved in inhibiting the occurrence and development of OS. Firstly, we found that miR-200c is downregulated in OS cells and tissues. As well, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that upregulating miR-200c inhibits the proliferation, invasion, metastasis of Saos-2 cells, promotes the apoptosis of Saos-2 cells and suppresses tumor growth in mice, indicating miR-200c plays a major role in regulating the OS progression. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis showed that an anti-tumor protein, necdin (NDN), might be a potential target by miR-200c. To verify this hypothesis, we measured the expression level of NDN in OS cells and tissues and found NDN is downregulated, suggesting NDN is functional in OS progression. Moreover, we found that the expression levels of NDN and miR-200c in in vivo and in vitro experiments were positively correlated. However, the results of dual-luciferase reporter gene experiment showed miR-200c does not directly act on the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of NDN gene, indicating that NDN might be an important pathway protein which regulates OS progression in the presence of miR-200c. Therefore, miR-200c/NDN could be potential targets for developing effective treatment against OS.",-1
Predicting Characteristics Associated with Breast Cancer Survival Using Multiple Machine Learning Approaches,"Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed female disorders globally. Numerous studies have been conducted to predict survival markers, although the majority of these analyses were conducted using simple statistical techniques. In lieu of that, this research employed machine learning approaches to develop models for identifying and visualizing relevant prognostic indications of breast cancer survival rates. A comprehensive hospital-based breast cancer dataset was collected from the National Cancer Institute's SEER Program's November 2017 update, which offers population-based cancer statistics. The dataset included female patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3). The dataset included nine predictor factors and one predictor variable that were linked to the patients' survival status (alive or dead). To identify important prognostic markers associated with breast cancer survival rates, prediction models were constructed using K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), AdaBoost, logistic regression (LR), voting classifier, and support vector machine (SVM). All methods yielded close results in terms of model accuracy and calibration measures, with the lowest achieved from logistic regression (accuracy = 80.57 percent) and the greatest acquired from the random forest (accuracy = 94.64 percent). Notably, the multiple machine learning algorithms utilized in this research achieved high accuracy, suggesting that these approaches might be used as alternative prognostic tools in breast cancer survival studies, especially in the Asian area.",-1
Alteration of Bile Acid Metabolism by a High-Fat Diet Is Associated with Plasma Transaminase Activities and Glucose Intolerance in Rats,"Ingestion of a high-fat (HF) diet is known to enhance bile acid (BA) secretion, but precise information about the BA molecular species is lacking, especially information on the conjugated BAs in enterohepatic circulation. As cholesterol is the precursor of BAs, we analyzed alterations of the entire BA metabolic pathway in response to a HF diet without the addition of cholesterol and BA in the diet. Additionally, we evaluated the relationships between BA metabolism and some disorders, such as plasma transaminase activities and glucose intolerance induced by the HF diet. Acclimated WKAH/HkmSlc male rats (3 wk old) were divided into two groups fed a control or the HF diet for 22 wk. Fasting blood glucose was measured during the experimental period, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed at week 21. As a result, ingestion of the HF diet selectively increased the concentration of taurocholic acid in the bile and small intestinal contents as well as deoxycholic acid in the large intestinal contents and feces. These results indicated a selective increase of 12Î±-hydroxylated BA concentrations in response to the HF diet. Moreover, fecal 12Î±-hydroxylated BA concentration was positively correlated with cumulative energy intake, visceral adipose tissue weight, and glucose intolerance. The present study suggests that fecal 12Î±-hydroxylated BA is a non-invasive marker that can detect the early phase of glucose intolerance.",-1
Relapsing MOG-IgG-associated diseases coexisting with anti-NMDAR encephalitis: a case report and literature review,"Background:                    In recent years, an overlapping syndrome, MNOS, of MOG encephalomyelitis and NMDARE has been clinically identified. In these diseases, both MOG-Ab and NMDAR-Ab are positive. Previous studies were almost case reports and incomprehensive which focused on this kind of overlapping syndrome in adults.              Methods:                    We reported a rare case of MNOS. In addition, we reviewed the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of MNOS in adults by consulting relevant literature.              Results:                    The patient initially presented with CNS demyelination symptoms followed by recurrent encephalitis, concomitant anti-MOG, and NMDAR antibodies. His symptoms improved significantly after initiating hormonal therapy. We searched previous MNOS case reports and 17 adult MNOS cases were retrieved. The previous history of all patients was unremarkable. Most of these patients (72.2%, 13/18) first developed NMDR encephalitis-related symptoms, such as cognitive behavior abnormalities, cognitive decline, and epilepsy. Some patients (16.7%, 3/18) first developed MOG-related demyelinating symptoms, such as visual deterioration, walking instability, and dizziness. The most common site of new brain lesions was the supratentorial region. In the acute phase, MNOS patients were sensitive to hormone therapy. During the follow-up, 72.2% (13/18) of the patients relapsed, with a median interval of 12.25 months. Immunotherapy was still effective after recurrence, and no deaths were reported.              Conclusions:                    (1) The clinical manifestations of MNOS are atypical, sometimes like MOG encephalomyelitis, sometimes like NMDARE, sometimes both of the characteristic clinical manifestations are present. (2) Immunotherapy is the primary treatment of patients with MNOS. (3) MNOS are prone to recurrence, and serum MOG and tumor markers should be monitored.",-1
Regulation of circADAMTS6-miR-324-5p-PIK3R3 ceRNA pathway may be a novel mechanism of IL-1Î²-induced osteoarthritic chondrocytes,"Introduction:                    A disintegrin and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 6 (ADAMTS6)-derived circular RNA (circADAMTS6; hsa_circ_0008667) is a novel regulator in interleukin (IL)-1Î²-induced apoptosis of human chondrocytes (HCs). Here, we planned to probe into its role and mechanism underlying HCs injury in osteoarthritis.              Materials and methods:                    Real time-quantitative PCR and immunoblotting estimated the abundance of RNA and protein, respectively. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by WST-8, EdU, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and caspase3/7 activity assays. Levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î±), apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-2-associated X protein), extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins (matrix metalloproteinase-13 and collagen type II alpha-1), and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway-related proteins (AKT, mTOR, phosphorylated-AKT, and phosphorylated-mTOR) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting. Target relationship was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, Argonaute-2 immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays.              Results:                    Abundances of circADAMTS6 and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3 (PIK3R3) were underexpressed, and microRNA (miR)-324-5p was elevated in human osteoarthritic tissues and IL-1Î²-induced HCs. Overexpressing circADAMTS6 and inhibiting miR-324-5p enhanced proliferation and ECM synthesis, but suppressed apoptosis and inflammatory response in IL-1Î²-challenged HCs. Besides, silencing circADAMTS6 caused similar effects of IL-1Î² stress on HCs. Mechanically, there was a direct interaction between miR-324-5p and circADAMTS6 or PIK3R3, and IL-1Î²-induced activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was suppressed by circADAMTS6 overexpression and miR-324-5p silencing. Furthermore, counteractive effects of miR-324-5p upregulation on circADAMTS6 overexpression and PIK3R3 knockdown on miR-324-5p silencing were observed.              Conclusion:                    CircADAMTS6-miR-324-5p-PIK3R3 axis might participate in IL-1Î²-induced HCs dysfunction via competing endogenous RNA mechanism and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",-1
Achievement of guideline recommended diabetes treatment targets and health habits in people with self-reported diabetes in India (ICMR-INDIAB-13): a national cross-sectional study,"Background:                    There is little information on comprehensive diabetes care comprising glycaemic, lipid, and blood pressure control in India; therefore, we aimed to assess the achievement of treatment targets among adults with self-reported diabetes.              Methods:                    The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-India Diabetes (INDIAB) study is a cross-sectional, population-based survey of adults aged 20 years or older in all 30 states and union territories of India. We used a stratified multistage sampling design, sampling states in a phased manner, and selected villages in rural areas and census enumeration blocks in urban areas. We used a three-level stratification method on the basis of geography, population size, and socioeconomic status for each state. For the outcome assessment, good glycaemic control was defined as HbA1c of less than 7Â·0% (A), blood pressure control was defined as less than 140/90 mm Hg (B), and the LDL cholesterol target was defined as less than 100 mg/dL (C). ABC control was defined as the proportion of individuals meeting glycaemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol targets together. We also performed multiple logistic regression to assess the factors influencing achievement of diabetes treatment targets.              Findings:                    Between Oct 18, 2008, and Dec 17, 2020, 113 043 individuals (33 537 from urban areas and 79 506 from rural areas) participated in the ICMR-INDIAB study. For this analysis, 5789 adults (2633 in urban areas and 3156 in rural areas) with self-reported diabetes were included in the study population. The median age was 56Â·1 years (IQR 55Â·7-56Â·5). Overall, 1748 (weighted proportion 36Â·3%, 95% CI 34Â·7-37Â·9) of 4834 people with diabetes achieved good glycaemic control, 2819 (weighted proportion 48Â·8%, 47Â·2-50Â·3) of 5698 achieved blood pressure control, and 2043 (weighted proportion 41Â·5%, 39Â·9-43Â·1) of 4886 achieved good LDL cholesterol control. Only 419 (weighted proportion 7Â·7%) of 5297 individuals with self-reported diabetes achieved all three ABC targets, with significant heterogeneity between regions and states. Higher education, male sex, rural residence, and shorter duration of diabetes (<10 years) were associated with better achievement of combined ABC targets. Only 951 (weighted proportion 16Â·7%) of the study population and 227 (weighted proportion 36Â·9%) of those on insulin reported using self-monitoring of blood glucose.              Interpretation:                    Achievement of treatment targets and adoption of healthy behaviours remains suboptimal in India. Our results can help governments to adopt policies that prioritise improvement of diabetes care delivery and surveillance in India.

"A Nested Case-Control Study of Serum Fasting Lipid Profiles in Pre- Eclamptic Primigravidas in Ile-Ife, Nigeria","Background:                    Pre-eclampsia contributes significantly to both maternal and perinatal morbidities and mortalities. One of the identified pathophysiologies of pre-eclampsia is the deranged serum lipid profile of which some components have been found to be elevated early in pregnancy in women destined to develop pre-eclampsia.              Objectives:                    To compare the serum fasting lipid profiles of pre-eclamptic primigravidas with normal primigravidas at week 20, 28, and 34.              Methods:                    We conducted a nested case-control study at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife between November 2016 and April 2018. A cohort of 290 primigravidas was recruited at week 20 and followed up until delivery. Serum fasting lipid profiles were quantified at weeks 20, 28 and 34 for all participants. Twenty four women that developed pre-eclampsia were compared with 48 women that had a normal pregnancy. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 22. We used a linear mixed-effect regression model with random intercept and slope. Significance was established using p<0.05.              Results:                    Serum lipid profiles showed an average weekly increase in both groups. Primigravidas that developed pre-eclampsia had a weekly increase of 0.2(SE0.14) mmol/l in serum total cholesterol more than those with normal pregnancies. (p<0.001) Serum low-density lipoprotein also showed a differential weekly increase of 0.1(SE0.05)mmol/l in primigravidas that developed pre-eclampsia over primigravidas with normal pregnancies. (p<0.001).              Conclusion:                    The average weekly increase in serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein was significantly higher in primigravidas that developed pre-eclampsia when compared to the control group. These findings depicted an association between serum lipid profile and pre-eclampsia among the primigravidas.",-1
Serum metabolomic signatures of gestational diabetes in South Asian and white European women,"Introduction:                    This study aimed to identify serum metabolomic signatures associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and to examine if ethnic-specific differences exist between South Asian and white European women.              Research design and methods:                    Prospective cohort study with a nested case-control analysis of 600 pregnant women from two Canadian birth cohorts; using an untargeted approach, 63 fasting serum metabolites were measured and analyzed using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was conducted overall and by cohort.              Results:                    The proportion of women with GDM was higher in South Asians (27.1%) compared with white Europeans (17.9%). Several amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid pathways related to GDM were common to South Asian and white European women. Elevated circulating concentrations of glutamic acid, propionylcarnitine, tryptophan, arginine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, and 3-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid were associated with higher odds of GDM, while higher glutamine, ornithine, oxoproline, cystine, glycine with lower odds of GDM. Per SD increase in glucose concentration, the odds of GDM increased (OR=2.07, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.71), similarly for metabolite ratios: glucose to glutamine (OR=2.15, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.80), glucose to creatinine (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.32), and glutamic acid to glutamine (OR=1.46, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.83). South Asians had higher circulating ratios of glucose to glutamine, glucose to creatinine, arginine to ornithine, and citrulline to ornithine, compared with white Europeans.              Conclusions:                    We identified a panel of serum metabolites implicated in GDM pathophysiology, consistent in South Asian and white European women. The metabolic alterations leading to larger ratios of glucose to glutamine, glucose to creatinine, arginine to ornithine, and citrulline to ornithine in South Asians likely reflect the greater burden of GDM among South Asians compared with white Europeans.",-1
Circular RNAs in atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory lesion of the arterial vessel wall caused by a variety of complex factors. Furthermore, it is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of death. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new family of endogenous non-coding RNAs with unique covalently closed loops that have sparked interest due to their unique characteristics and potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications in various diseases. A growing number of studies have shown that circRNAs can be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of AS. In this article, we review the biogenesis, classification as well as functions of circRNA and summarize the research on circRNA as a diagnostic biomarker for AS. Finally, we describe the regulatory capacity of circRNA in AS pathogenesis through its pathogenesis and demonstrate the potential therapeutic role of circRNA for AS.",-1
Considering Insulin Secretory Capacity as Measured by a Fasting C-Peptide/Glucose Ratio in Selecting Glucose-Lowering Medications,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disease. Recently introduced new subclassifications promise more efficacious, tailored treatments which could complement current guidelines. In the differentiation of the new diabetes subphenotypes, assessment of insulin secretion is one of the essential components. Based on a large number of insulin secretion measurements, we propose fasting C-peptide/glucose ratio (CGR) as an adequate and practicable estimate of insulin secretion. CGR discriminates insulin deficiency from insulin hypersecretion. We suggest using insulin secretion, determined from CGR, as an essential input for therapeutic decisions at the beginning or modification of diabetes treatment. Furthermore, we propose 3 practical steps to guide decisions in the subtype-specific therapy of diabetes mellitus. The first step consists of detecting insulin deficiency indicated by a low CGR with the need for immediate insulin therapy. The second step is related to high CGR and aims at lowering cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes. The third step is the consideration of a de-escalation of glucose-lowering therapy in individuals with mild diabetes subphenotypes.",-1
Sub-Scarpa's Lipectomy in Abdominoplasty: An Analysis of Risks and Rewards in 723 Consecutive Patients,"Background:                    During the course of performing abdominoplasties, a plastic surgeon will encounter a certain body habitus characterized by a thick, tethered, and excessively redundant upper skin flap. Often these patients also demonstrate diffuse and substantial fascial laxity. One approach to this problem involves direct thinning and release of the flap by resection of the sub-Scarpa's fat pad. In theory, this resection should be safe from a flap perfusion standpoint. However, the safety of the sub-Scarpa's resection has not been completely documented.              Objectives:                    The author sought to assess the safety and efficacy of sub-Scarpa's lipectomy in abdominoplasty.              Methods:                    A total 723 patients were retrospectively examined and divided into 2 groups: those with (Group B) and those without (Group A) a sub-Scarpa's lipectomy component to the abdominoplasty. Because of differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, data analysis was performed with a logistic regression model and with propensity score matching.              Results:                    The sub-Scarpa's lipectomy technique allowed for substantial thinning of the flap: the average weight of the resected fat pad was 411 g. Wide undermining allowed for substantial fascial correction, and excellent results were obtainable even in challenging cases. The sub-Scarpa's lipectomy group did not demonstrate an increase in either minor (<5 cm2) or major (>5 cm2) flap necrosis. However, there was a statistically significant increase in fat necrosis and seroma formation in Group B compared with Group A. In both groups, an increasing body mass index was a risk factor for fat necrosis and major flap necrosis.              Conclusions:                    The implementation of a sub-Scarpa's lipectomy during abdominoplasty is a useful technique to consider for selected abdominoplasty candidates. The risks of minor and major flap loss do not seem to be increased compared to the standard abdominoplasty, but the risks of fat necrosis and seroma formation may be greater.",-1
MicroRNA-631 deriving from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell exosomes facilitates the malignant behavior of non-small cell lung cancer via modulating the E2F family of transcription factor 2/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway,"The exosomes (Exo) had always been considered as transport vectors for microRNA (miRNA). An increasing number of data had clarified the influence of Exo on the cell progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, its specific mechanism had not yet been verified. This work was to explore the potential mechanism of Exo-derived miR-631 targeting and regulating E2F family of transcription factor 2 (E2F2) to repress the malignant behavior of NSCLC cells. Test of microRNA (miR)-631 and E2F2 in NSCLC was performed. BMSCs-Exo that altered miR-631 was co-cultured with NSCLC cells. Detection of the cloning and progression of NSCLC cells was performed. Testification of the targeting of miR-631 with E2F2 was conducted. In vivo experiments were performed to verify the results in vitro. In short, elevation of miR-631 Exo repressed the advancement and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation of NSCLC cells, while silence of miR-631 was in the opposite. In terms of mechanism, miR-631 exerted the influence via targeting E2F2. The coincident results were obtained in animal models. In brief, BMSC-Exo mediated E2F2 via delivering miR-631 to NSCLC cells to modulate the malignant behavior of NSCLC.",-1
A Novel Sentiment Analysis Model of Museum User Experience Evaluation Data Based on Unbalanced Data Analysis Technology,"With the development of virtual reality and digital reconstruction technology, digital museums have been widely promoted in various cities. Digital museums offer new ways to display and disseminate cultural heritage. It allows remote users to autonomously browse displays in a physical museum environment in a digital space. It is also possible to reproduce the lost heritage through digital reconstruction and restoration, so as to digitally present tangible cultural heritage and intangible cultural heritage to the public. However, the user's experience of using digital museums has not been fully and deeply studied at present. In this study, the user's experience evaluation data of digital museum are classified and processed, so as to analyze the user's emotional trend towards the museum. Considering that the user's evaluation data are unbalanced data, this study uses an unbalanced support vector machine (USVM) in the classification of user evaluation data. The main idea of this method is that the boundary of the support vector is continuously shifted to the majority class by repeatedly oversampling some support vectors until the real support vector samples are found. The experimental results show that the classification obtained by the used USVM has a good practical reference value. Based on the classification results of the evaluation data, the construction of the digital museum can be further guided and maintained, thereby improving the user experience satisfaction of the museum. This research will make an important contribution to the construction of the museum and the inheritance of culture.",-1
Transcription shifts in gut bacteria shared between mothers and their infants,"The infant gut microbiome contains a portion of bacteria that originate from the maternal gut. In the infant gut these bacteria encounter a new metabolic environment that differs from the adult gut, consequently requiring adjustments in their activities. We used pilot community RNA sequencing data (metatranscriptomes) from ten mother-infant dyads participating in the NiPPeR Study to characterize bacterial gene expression shifts following mother-to-infant transmission. Maternally-derived bacterial strains exhibited large scale gene expression shifts following the transmission to the infant gut, with 12,564 activated and 14,844 deactivated gene families. The implicated genes were most numerous and the magnitude shifts greatest in Bacteroides spp. This pilot study demonstrates environment-dependent, strain-specific shifts in gut bacteria function and underscores the importance of metatranscriptomic analysis in microbiome studies.",-1
Systematic identification of plausible pathways to potential harm via problem formulation for investigational releases of a population suppression gene drive to control the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae in West Africa,"Background:                    Population suppression gene drive has been proposed as a strategy for malaria vector control. A CRISPR-Cas9-based transgene homing at the doublesex locus (dsxFCRISPRh) has recently been shown to increase rapidly in frequency in, and suppress, caged laboratory populations of the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae. Here, problem formulation, an initial step in environmental risk assessment (ERA), was performed for simulated field releases of the dsxFCRISPRh transgene in West Africa.              Methods:                    Building on consultative workshops in Africa that previously identified relevant environmental and health protection goals for ERA of gene drive in malaria vector control, 8 potentially harmful effects from these simulated releases were identified. These were stratified into 46 plausible pathways describing the causal chain of events that would be required for potential harms to occur. Risk hypotheses to interrogate critical steps in each pathway, and an analysis plan involving experiments, modelling and literature review to test each of those risk hypotheses, were developed.              Results:                    Most potential harms involved increased human (n = 13) or animal (n = 13) disease transmission, emphasizing the importance to subsequent stages of ERA of data on vectorial capacity comparing transgenics to non-transgenics. Although some of the pathways (n = 14) were based on known anatomical alterations in dsxFCRISPRh homozygotes, many could also be applicable to field releases of a range of other transgenic strains of mosquito (n = 18). In addition to population suppression of target organisms being an accepted outcome for existing vector control programmes, these investigations also revealed that the efficacy of population suppression caused by the dsxFCRISPRh transgene should itself directly affect most pathways (n = 35).              Conclusions:                    Modelling will play an essential role in subsequent stages of ERA by clarifying the dynamics of this relationship between population suppression and reduction in exposure to specific potential harms. This analysis represents a comprehensive identification of plausible pathways to potential harm using problem formulation for a specific gene drive transgene and organism, and a transparent communication tool that could inform future regulatory studies, guide subsequent stages of ERA, and stimulate further, broader engagement on the use of population suppression gene drive to control malaria vectors in West Africa.",-1
Post-Illumination Pupil Response as a Biomarker for Cognition in Î±-Synucleinopathies,"Neurodegenerative processes in the brain are reflected by structural retinal changes. As a possible biomarker of cognitive state in prodromal Î±-synucleinopathies, we compared melanopsin-mediated post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) with cognition (CERAD-plus) in 69 patients with isolated REM-sleep behavior disorder. PIPR was significantly correlated with cognitive domains, especially executive functioning (r = 0.417, p < 0.001), which was more pronounced in patients with lower dopamine-transporter density, suggesting advanced neurodegenerative state (n = 26; r = 0.575, p = 0.002). Patients with mild neurocognitive disorder (n = 10) had significantly reduced PIPR (smaller melanopsin-mediated response) compared to those without (p = 0.001). Thus, PIPR may be a functional-possibly monitoring-marker for impaired cognitive state in (prodromal) Î±-synucleinopathies.",-1
"Imaging of the nigrostriatal system for evaluating the preclinical phase of Parkinson's disease development: the utility of neuromelanin, diffusion MRI, and DAT-SPECT","Objective:                    To assess the utility of examining the nigrostriatal system with MRI and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging for evaluating the preclinical phase of Parkinson's disease (PD).              Methods:                    The subjects were 32 patients with early PD and a history of probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD; PD group), 15 patients with idiopathic RBD (RBD group), and 24 age-matched healthy controls (HC group) who underwent neuromelanin and diffusion tensor MRI for analysis of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The RBD and PD groups underwent DAT imaging. In the RBD group, totals of 39 MRI and 27 DAT imaging examinations were obtained longitudinally. For each value, intergroup differences and receiver operating characteristic analysis for diagnostic performance were examined statistically.              Results:                    The neuromelanin value was significantly lower and the diffusion tensor values except fractional anisotropy were significantly higher in the RBD and PD groups than in the HC group. The DAT specific binding ratio (SBR) was significantly lower in the PD group than in the RBD group. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for neuromelanin/mean diffusivity value in the SNpc were 0.76/0.82 for diagnosing RBD and 0.83/0.80 for diagnosing PD. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the SBR for discriminating PD from RBD was 0.87.              Conclusion:                    MRI and DAT imaging may be useful for evaluating sequential nigrostriatal changes during the preclinical phase of PD.              Advances in knowledge:                    MRI detects nigrostriatal changes in both RBD and early PD, and DAT imaging detects nigrostriatal changes during the transition to PD in RBD.",-1
LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 promotes osteogenic differentiation via miR-205-5p/RICTOR axis,"Osteoporosis is a prevalent degenerative disease that is characterized by decreased bone density and strength, resulting in gradually increasing bone fragility. Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the occurrence and development of osteoporosis. Herein, we explored the role of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). QPCR results indicated that KCNQ1OT1 and RICTOR were down-regulated, while miR-205-5p was up-regulated in the osteoporotic patients, as compared with non-osteoporotic controls. During the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, the expression of KCNQ1OT1 and RICTOR was upregulated, whereas miR-205-5p was downregulated. The interaction among KCNQ1OT1, miR-205-5p and RICTOR was validated by dual luciferase reporter system. KCNQ1OT1 promoted RICTOR expression via inhibiting miR-205-5p, therefore promoting osteogenesis as demonstrated by ALP assay, alizarin red staining and the increased expression of osteogenic markers (OPN, RUNX2 and OCN). Furthermore, KCNQ1OT1 overexpression or miR-205-5p inhibition could promote ALP activity and mineralization of BMSCs, while overexpressed miR-205-5p could reverse the effects of overexpressed KCNQ1OT1, and knockdown of RICTOR could reverse the effects of miR-205-5p inhibition. In conclusion, our study illustrated that KCNQ1OT1 might inhibit miR-205-5p in BMSCs, thus upregulating the expression of RICTOR and promoting osteogenic differentiation.",-1
Evaluating dopamine transporter imaging as an enrichment biomarker in a phase 2 Parkinson's disease trial,"Background:                    Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DaT-SPECT) can quantify the functional integrity of the dopaminergic nerve terminals and has been suggested as an imaging modality to verify the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Depending on the stage of progression, approximately 5-15% of participants clinically diagnosed with idiopathic PD have been observed in previous studies to have normal DaT-SPECT patterns. However, the utility of DaT-SPECT in enhancing early PD participant selection in a global, multicenter clinical trial of a potentially disease-modifying therapy is not well understood.              Methods:                    The SPARK clinical trial was a phase 2 trial of cinpanemab, a monoclonal antibody against alpha-synuclein, in participants with early PD. DaT-SPECT was performed at screening to select participants with DaT-SPECT patterns consistent with degenerative parkinsonism. Acquisition was harmonised across 82 sites. Images were reconstructed and qualitatively read at a central laboratory by blinded neuroradiologists for inclusion prior to automated quantitative analysis.              Results:                    In total, 482 unique participants were screened between January 2018 and May 2019; 3.8% (15/398) of imaged participants were excluded owing to negative DaT-SPECT findings (i.e., scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit [SWEDD]).              Conclusion:                    A smaller proportion of SPARK participants were excluded owing to SWEDD status upon DaT-SPECT screening than has been reported in prior studies. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for the low SWEDD rate in this study and whether these results are generalisable to future studies. If supported, the radiation risks, imaging costs, and operational burden of DaT-SPECT for enrichment may be mitigated by clinical assessment and other study design aspects.              Trial registration:                    ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03318523 . Date submitted: October 19, 2017. First Posted: October 24, 2017.",-1
Effect of Diabetes Mellitus on Implant Osseointegration of Titanium Screws: An Animal Experimental Study,"Objective:                    To explore the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on implant osseointegration of titanium screws.              Methods:                    Sixty rats were randomly divided into a DM group and a control group (each group, n = 30). DM group rats were injected with 1% Streptozotocin solution at 65 mg/kg to establish a DM model. Titanium screws were implanted into the rats' distal femurs in both groups. The rats were sacrificed for micro-CT scanning, micro-indentation, biomechanical detection, confocal Raman microspectroscopy, and histological and histomorphometric analysis at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-implantation, respectively. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein expression of the related growth factors around the implant were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blots.              Results:                    At 4, 8 and 12 weeks, micro-CT scanning, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, Gieson's acid-magenta staining, and fluorescent labeled staining showed disorder in the bone tissue arrangement, a lack of new bone tissue, poor maturity and continuity, and poor trabecular bone parameters around the implant in the DM group. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks, the interfacial bone binding rate in the DM group was significantly lower (16.2% Â± 4.8%, 25.7% Â± 5.7%, 42.5% Â± 5.8%, respectively) than that in the control group (23.6% Â± 5.2%, 40.8% Â± 6.3%, 64.2% Â± 7.3%, respectively; P < 0.05). At 8 and 12 weeks, the elastic modulus (17.0 Â± 1.8 and 15.1 Â± 1.5 GPa, respectively) and trabecular bone hardness (571 Â± 39 and 401 Â± 37 MPa, respectively) in the DM group were significantly lower than the elastic modulus (23.4 Â± 2.3 and 23.8 Â± 1.8 GPa, respectively) and trabecular bone hardness (711 Â± 45 and 719 Â± 46 MPa, respectively) in the control group (P < 0.05). The maximum load required for the prosthesis pull-out experiment in the DM group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks (55.14 Â± 6.74 N, 73.34 Â± 8.43 N, and 83.45 Â± 8.32 N, respectively) was significantly lower than that in the control group (77.45 Â± 7.48 N, 93.28 Â± 8.29 N, and 123.62 Â± 9.43 N, respectively, P < 0.05). At 8 and 12 weeks, the mineral-to-collagen ratio in the DM group (6.56 % Â± 1.35% and 4.45%Â± 1.25%, respectively) was significantly higher than that in the control group (5.31% Â± 1.42% and 3.62% Â± 1.33%, respectively, P < 0.05). At 12 weeks, mRNA and protein expression levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2, transforming growth factor-Î²1, vascular endothelial growth factor, osteopontin, osteocalcin, and runt-related transcription factor 2 in the DM group were significantly lower than that in the control group.              Conclusions:                    DM can negatively affect bone osseointegration, manifesting as disorder in bone tissue arrangement around the implant, a lack of new bone tissue, poor maturity and continuity, poor trabecular bone parameters and lower expression of the related growth factors.",-1
Association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and global DNA methylation in visceral adipose tissue from colorectal cancer patients,"Background:                    Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) has been identified as the essential fat depot for pathogenetic theories that associateobesity and colon cancer. LINE-1 hypomethylation has been mostly detected in tumor colon tissue, but less is known about the epigenetic pattern in surrounding tissues. The aim was to analyze for the first time the potential relationship between serum vitamin D, obesity and global methylation (LINE-1) in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from patients with and without colorectal cancer.              Methods:                    A total of 55 patients with colorectal cancer and 35 control subjects participated in the study. LINE-1 DNA methylation in VAT was measured by pyrosequencing. Serum 25(OH)D levels were determined by ELISA.              Results:                    Cancer patients had lower levels of LINE-1 methylation in VAT compared with the control group. In the subjects with colorectal cancer, LINE-1 DNA methylation levels were associated positively with vitamin D levels (r = 0,463; p < 0.001) and negatively with BMI (r = - 0.334, p = 0.01) and HOMA insulin resistance index (r = - 0.348, p = 0.01). Serum vitamin D was the main variable explaining the LINE-1% variance in the cancer group (Î² = 0.460, p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, subjects with higher LINE-1 methylation values had lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (OR = 0.53; IC95% =0.28-0.99) compared with the control group.              Conclusions:                    We showed for the first time an association between LINE-1 DNA methylation in VAT and vitamin D levels in subjects with colorectal cancer, highlighting the importance of VAT from cancer patients, which could be modified epigenetically compared to healthy subjects.",-1
Meprin A1 subunit beta gene polymorphism is associated with the length of post-partum anestrus interval in Murrah buffaloes,"Postpartum anestrus interval (PPAI) is the interval between parturition and the first postpartum estrus exhibition in animals. Appearance of both normal and PPA buffaloes under the same farm conditions indicates the role of possible genetic predisposition to PPA. To identify the genetic and non-genetic factors associated with PPA in buffaloes, we collected data on PPAI and other 38 non-genetic variables from 575 Murrah buffaloes in the field conditions and identified the PPA associated non-genetic factors in our previous study. To explore the genetic factors associated with the unexplained variation in PPAI residuals, the present study identified 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13 candidate genes using Sanger sequencing. Exploration of their association with the PPAI residuals of 50 extreme PPA and 50 normal buffaloes identified the significant (P < 0.01) association of the SNP (g.37219977A>G) in the 3'-UTR region of the Meprin A 1 subunit beta (Mep1b) gene with PPAI, which was further validated (P = 0.058) in a large population sample (n = 417). Bioinformatics analysis of the 3'-UTR region has identified three miRNA, bta-miR-2420, bta-miR-2325b and bta-miR-453 that could regulate Igf-1 in the plasma of animals with different genotypes (GG, AG and AA). The higher Igf-1 levels in the GG genotypes than that of AA and AG genotypes of this SNP (g.37219977A>G) further suggest the association of Mep1b gene with PPA condition in Murrah buffaloes. As a result of this study, we propose that buffaloes with protective alleles at this SNP be selected to improve the herd's reproductive efficiency.",-1
Metal-organic framework nanoreactor-based electrochemical biosensor coupled with three-dimensional DNA walker for label-free detection of microRNA,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), serving as the regulators for gene expression and cellular function, have emerged as the important biomarkers for diagnosis of cancers. In this study, a label-free electrochemical biosensing platform equipped with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based nanoreactors has been developed by coupling three-dimensional (3D) DNA walker for amplification detection of miRNA. The MOF-based nanoreactors are constructed via the encapsulation of GOx in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) driven by the rapid GOx-triggered nucleation of ZIF-8 with high catalytic activity, which also contributes to preserve the biological activity of GOx even in harsh environments. The gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are further loaded on the surface of ZIF-8 by electrostatic adsorption, which can be used to not only anchor the orbit of 3D DNA walker by Au-S covalent bond but also promote the electron transfer on electrode interface. In the presence of target miRNA-21, the 3D DNA walker is initiated, resulting in the recycling of targets and the immobilization of numerous fuel DNAs with G-quadruplex/hemin complex on the nanoreactors spontaneously. As a result, a cascade catalysis reaction is triggered in the confined space of ZIF-8 nanoreactors, where the H2O2 as an intermediate is generated with the oxidization of glucose catalyzed by GOx and subsequently decomposed by G-quadruplex/hemin HRP-mimicking DNAzyme for the further oxidation of ABTS to obtain a differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed electrochemical biosensor exhibits an excellent performance for amplification detection of miRNA-21 in the dynamic working range from 0.1 nM to 10 Î¼M with a detection limit of 29 pM, which opens a new way for clinical analysis of miRNAs and early diagnosis of cancers.",-1
Comparative Effects of Medical Versus Surgical Weight Loss on Body Composition: a Pilot Randomized Trial,"Objective:                    Bariatric surgery leads to more rapid and greater weight loss (WL) compared to medical weight loss (MWL), but the differences in body composition (BC) changes for these modalities remain unclear. Due to the known health risks associated with central adiposity, we compared the changes in regional distribution of fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM) after surgical versus MWL.              Methods:                    In this 1:1:1 randomized trial among 15 persons with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) 30-39.9 kg/m2, we compared changes in BC, by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and abdominal computerized tomography, at time of 10%WL or 9 months after intervention (whichever came first). Participants underwent MWL, adjustable gastric banding (AGB), or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Non-parametric tests evaluated BC differences (FM, LM, and visceral adipose tissue [VAT]) within and across all three arms and between pair-wise comparisons.              Results:                    Twelve female participants (75% African American) completed the study. Patient age, BMI, and baseline anthropometric characteristics were similar across study arms. AGB lost more LM (MWL - 5.2%, AGB - 10.3%, p = 0.021) and VAT (MWL + 10.9%, AGB - 28.0%, p = 0.049) than MWL. RYGB tended to lose more VAT (MWL +10.9%, RYGB - 20.2%, p = 0.077) than MWL. AGB tended to lose more LM than RYGB (AGB - 12.38%, RYGB - 7.29%, p = 0.15).              Conclusions:                    At similar WL, AGB lost more LM and VAT than MWL; RYGB similarly lost more VAT. Given the metabolic benefits of reducing VAT and retaining LM, larger studies should confirm the changes in BC after surgical versus medical WL.

Acute Parkinsonism in a Patient with Spinal Cord Injury: A Case Report,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism, a clinical syndrome that includes bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability. Secondary causes of parkinsonism include chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, clear physiopathologic association between spinal cord injury (SCI) and PD has not been well described yet. We describe a rare/unusual case of a patient with C7-D1 fracture/listhesis who, 12 days after the trauma, developed a progressive cognitive impairment together with mandibular tremor. Seven days after the onset of symptoms, because of the persistence of mandibular tremor and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4, therapy with L-DOPA/benserazide was started, which resulted in gradual reduction of symptoms and complete recovery of consciousness. This could be the first report of PD appearing only 12 days after an SCI in the acute stage. Early differential diagnosis on the first manifestations of this kind of symptoms should be considered in patients with SCI to set up the right therapy essential for improving the outcome and preventing devastating consequences. This might also provide insights into the potential pathophysiologic responses of the brain after primary (immediate) and secondary (delayed) damages.",-1
Metallic artifact reduction by evaluation of the additional value of iterative reconstruction algorithms in hip prosthesis computed tomography imaging,"To evaluate iterative metal artifact reduction (iMAR) technique in images data of hip prosthesis on computed tomography (CT) and the added value of advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) compared with standard filtered back projection (FBP).Twenty-eight patients addressed to CT examinations for hip prosthesis were included prospectively. Images were reconstructed with iMAR algorithm in addition to FBP and ADMIRE techniques. Measuring image noise assessed objective image quality and attenuation values with standardized region of interest (ROI) in 4 predefined anatomical structures (gluteus medius and rectus femoris muscles, inferior and anterior abdominal fat, and femoral vessels when contrast media was present). Subjective image quality was graded on a 5-point Likert scale, taking into account the size of artifacts, the metal-bone interface and the conspicuity of pelvic organs, and the diagnostic confidence.Improvement in overall image quality was statistically significant using iMAR (P<.001) compared with ADMIRE and FBP. ADMIRE did not show any impact in image noise, attenuation value, or global quality image. iMAR showed a significant decrease in image noise in all ROIs (Hounsfield Unit) as compared with FBP and ADMIRE. Interobserver agreement was high in all reconstructions (FBP, FBP+iMAR, ADMIRE, and ADMIRE + iMAR) more than 0.8. iMAR reconstructions showed emergence of new artifacts in bone-metal interface.iMAR algorithm allows a significant reduction of metal artifacts on CT images with unilateral or bilateral prostheses without additional value of ADMIRE. It improves the analysis of surrounding tissue but potentially generates new artifacts in bone-metal interface.",-1
Combined effects of host genetics and diet on human gut microbiota and incident disease in a single population cohort,"Human genetic variation affects the gut microbiota through a complex combination of environmental and host factors. Here we characterize genetic variations associated with microbial abundances in a single large-scale population-based cohort of 5,959 genotyped individuals with matched gut microbial metagenomes, and dietary and health records (prevalent and follow-up). We identified 567 independent SNP-taxon associations. Variants at the LCT locus associated with Bifidobacterium and other taxa, but they differed according to dairy intake. Furthermore, levels of Faecalicatena lactaris associated with ABO, and suggested preferential utilization of secreted blood antigens as energy source in the gut. Enterococcus faecalis levels associated with variants in the MED13L locus, which has been linked to colorectal cancer. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a potential causal effect of Morganella on major depressive disorder, consistent with observational incident disease analysis. Overall, we identify and characterize the intricate nature of host-microbiota interactions and their association with disease.",-1
The role of the colonic microbiota and bile acids in colorectal cancer,"Purpose of review:                    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Of the various established risk factors for this aggressive condition, diet is a notable modifiable risk factor. This review aims to summarize the mounting evidence to suggest the role of diet, the microbiota and their cross-talk in modulating an individual's risk of developing CRC.              Recent findings:                    Specifically, the metabolism of bile acids and its symbiosis with the microbiota has gained weight given its basis on a high meat, high fat, and low fibre diet that is present in populations with the highest risk of CRC. Bacteria modify bile acids that escape enterohepatic circulation to increase the diversity of the human bile acid pool. The production of microbial bile acids contributes to this as well. Epidemiological studies have shown that changing the diet results in different levels and composition of bile acids, which has in turn modified the risk of CRC at a population level. Evidence to identify underlying mechanisms have tied into the microbiota-led digestions of various foods into fatty acids that feedback into bile acid physiology as well as modulation of endogenous receptors for bile acids.              Summary:                    There is adequate evidence to support the role of microbiota in in the metabolism of bile acids, and how this relates to colorectal cancer. Further work is necessary to identify specific bacteriome involved and their underlying mechanistic pathways.",-1
Metamaterial Vivaldi Antenna Array for Breast Cancer Detection,"The objective of this work is the design and validation of a directional Vivaldi antenna to detect tumor cells' electromagnetic waves with a frequency of around 5 GHz. The proposed antenna is 33% smaller than a traditional Vivaldi antenna due to the use of metamaterials in its design. It has an excellent return loss of 25 dB at 5 GHz and adequate radiation characteristics as its gain is 6.2 dB at 5 GHz. The unit cell size of the proposed metamaterial is 0.058Î» Ã 0.054Î» at the operation frequency of 5 GHz. The proposed antenna was designed and optimized in CST microwave software, and the measured and simulated results were in good agreement. The experimental study demonstrates that an array composed with the presented antennas can detect the existence of tumors in a liquid breast phantom with positional accuracy through the analysis of the minimum amplitude of Sii.",-1
Evaluating atrial fibrillation artificial intelligence for the ED: statistical and clinical implications,"Objective:                    An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has been developed to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation (AF) present on an electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained during normal sinus rhythm. We evaluated the ability of this algorithm to predict incident AF in an emergency department (ED) cohort of patients presenting with palpitations without concurrent AF.              Methods:                    This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older who presented with palpitations to one of 15 ED sites and had a 12âlead ECG performed. Patients with prior AF or newly diagnosed AF during the ED visit were excluded. Of the remaining patients, those with a follow up ECG or Holter monitor in the subsequent year were included. We evaluated the performance of the AI-ECG output to predict incident AF within one year of the index ECG by estimating an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were determined at the optimum threshold (maximizing sensitivity and specificity), and thresholds by output decile for the sample.              Results:                    A total of 1403 patients were included. Forty-three (3.1%) patients were diagnosed with new AF during the following year. The AI-ECG algorithm predicted AF with an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.68-0.80), and an optimum threshold with sensitivity 79.1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 66.9%-91.2%), and specificity 66.1% (95% CI 63.6%-68.6%).              Conclusions:                    We found this AI-ECG AF algorithm to maintain statistical significance in predicting incident AF, with clinical utility for screening purposes limited in this ED population with a low incidence of AF.",-1
"Geraniol Ameliorates Doxorubicin-Mediated Kidney Injury through Alteration of Antioxidant Status, Inflammation, and Apoptosis: Potential Roles of NF-ÎºB and Nrf2/Ho-1","Doxorubicin-mediated kidney impairment is a serious problem in cancer treatment. Accordingly, this work investigated the ability of geraniol to modulate doxorubicin-induced kidney damage using a rat model. Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control, doxorubicin (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.), doxorubicin plus 100 mg/kg of geraniol, and doxorubicin plus 200 mg/kg of geraniol. A single doxorubicin injection triggered kidney impairment, as evidenced by the altered serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and albumin values; it also caused histological changes in the kidney architecture. Additionally, doxorubicin enhanced lipid peroxidation while lowering reduced glutathione, catalase activity, and the expression of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Interestingly, pre-treatment with geraniol rescued doxorubicin-induced alterations in kidney antioxidant parameters, enzymatic activity, and the expression of inflammatory and apoptosis-mediating gene and proteins. Moreover, prophylactic treatment with geraniol preserved most kidney histological characteristics in a dose-dependent manner. These findings support that geraniol could protect against doxorubicin-mediated kidney dysfunction. However, further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms of geraniol's protective effects against doxorubicin-mediated kidney dysfunction.",-1
E93 confers steroid hormone responsiveness of digestive enzymes to promote blood meal digestion in the midgut of the mosquito Aedes aegypti,"Anautogenous female mosquitoes obtain the nutrients needed for egg development from vertebrate blood, and consequently they transmit numerous pathogens of devastating human diseases. Digestion of blood proteins into amino acids that are used for energy production, egg maturation and replenishment of maternal reserves is an essential part of the female mosquito reproductive cycle. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the transcription factor E93 is a critical factor promoting blood meal digestion in adult females of the major arboviral vector Aedes aegypti in response to the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). E93 was upregulated in the female mosquito midgut after a blood meal, and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of E93 inhibited midgut blood digestion. E93 RNAi depletion repressed late trypsin (LT), serine protease I (SPI), SPVI and SPVII, and activated early trypsin (ET) expression in the female mosquito midgut after a blood meal. Injection of 20E activated E93, LT, SPI, SPVI and SPVII, and repressed ET expression, whereas RNAi knockdown of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) repressed E93, LT, SPI, SPVI and SPVII, and activated ET expression in the midgut. Furthermore, E93 depletion resulted in a complete loss of 20E responsiveness of LT, SPVI and SPVII. Our findings reveal important mechanisms regulating blood meal digestion in disease-transmitting mosquitoes.",-1
"Are There Bad ICU Rooms? Temporal Relationship between Patient and ICU Room Microbiome, and Influence on Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus Colonization","The gut microbiome of an individual can shape the local environmental surface microbiome. We sought to determine how the intensive care unit (ICU) patient gut microbiome shapes the ICU room surface microbiome, focusing on vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), a common ICU pathogen. This was an ICU-based prospective cohort study. Rectal swabs were performed in adult ICU patients immediately at the time of ICU admission and environmental surface swabs were performed at five predetermined time points. All swabs underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and culture for VRE. 304 ICU patients and 24 ICU rooms were sampled (5 longitudinal samples per ICU room). Spatially adjacent ICU rooms were no more microbially similar than nonadjacent rooms. Microbial signatures within rooms diverged rapidly over time: in 14 days, ICU rooms were as similar to other ICU rooms as they were to their prior selves. This divergence over time was more pronounced in rooms with higher patient turnover. Examining VRE status by culture, patient VRE gut colonization had modest agreement with room surface VRE (kappa statistic 0.36). There were no ICU rooms that consistently cultured positive for VRE, including those that housed VRE positive patients. Individual ICU patients had a limited impact on ICU room surface microbiome, and rooms diverged similarly over time regardless of patients. Patient VRE gut colonization may have a modest influence on room surface VRE but there were no ""bad rooms"" that consistently cultured positive for VRE. These results may be useful in planning infection control measures. IMPORTANCE This study found that intensive care unit (ICU) room microbial signatures diverged from their baseline quickly: within 2 weeks, individual ICU rooms had lost distinguishing characteristics and were as similar to other ICU rooms as they were to their former selves. Patient turnover within rooms accelerated this drift. Patient gut colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) was associated with ICU room surface contamination with VRE; again, within 2 weeks, this association was substantially diminished. These results provide dynamic information regarding how patients control the microbiota on local hospital room surfaces and may facilitate decision making for infection prevention and control measures targeting VRE or other organisms.",-1
Acanthopanax senticosus total flavonoids alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal inflammation and modulate the gut microbiota in mice,"Here, we study the therapeutic effect of Acanthopanax senticosus total flavonoids (ASTFs) using a mouse intestinal inflammation model. The inflammation model used in the present study was developed through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment of mice. The experimental mice were divided into a control group, model group (10 mg/kg LPS), dexamethasone group (1 mg/kg DEX) and ASTF low-, medium- and high-dosage groups (200, 400 and 800 mg/kg, respectively). The morphological and structural changes in the ileum, jejunum and duodenum were observed using HE staining. The number of intestinal goblet cells (GCs) was calculated based on PAS staining. The contents of interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the related mRNA expression level were measured by RT-PCR. The protein expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, p65 and p-p65 were measured using Western blotting. In addition, the 16S rRNA sequences of bacterial taxa were amplified and analyzed to assess changes in the intestinal microbes of LPS-induced mice and also in response to regulation by ASTF. Following intervention with ASTF, different therapeutic effects were shown according to the various dosages tested, all of which resulted in improved intestinal morphology and an increased number of intestinal GCs, while the contents of IL-1Î², IL-6, PGE2 and TNF-Î± and the related mRNA expression level were significantly reduced. The TLR4, MyD88 and p-p65/p-65 protein expression levels were also significantly reduced. In addition, 16S rRNA sequencing results show that LPS disrupts the structure of mouse gut microbes, though we observed that normal microbial status can be restored through ASTF intervention.",-1
Gradient tree boosting and network propagation for the identification of pan-cancer survival networks,"Cancer survival prediction is typically done with uninterpretable machine learning techniques, e.g., gradient tree boosting. Therefore, additional steps are needed to infer biological plausibility of the predictions. Here, we describe a protocol that combines pan-cancer survival prediction with XGBoost tree-ensemble learning and subsequent propagation of the learned feature weights on protein interaction networks. This protocol is based on TCGA transcriptome data of 8,024 patients from 25 cancer types but can easily be adapted to cancer patient data from other sources. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Thedinga and Herwig (2022).",-1
"Live-Birth Prediction of Natural-Cycle In Vitro Fertilization Using 57,558 Linked Cycle Records: A Machine Learning Perspective","Background:                    Natural-cycle in vitro fertilization (NC-IVF) is an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle without gonadotropins or any other stimulation of follicular growth. Previous studies on live-birth prediction of NC-IVF were very few; the sample size was very limited. This study aims to construct a machine learning model to predict live-birth occurrence of NC-IVF using 57,558 linked cycle records and help clinicians develop treatment strategies.              Design and methods:                    The dataset contained 57,558 anonymized register patient records undergoing NC-IVF cycles from 2005 to 2016 filtered from 7bsp;60,732 records in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) data. We selected matching records and features through data filtering and feature selection methods. Two groups of twelve machine learning models were trained and tested. Eight metrics, e.g., F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), etc., were computed to evaluate the performance of each model.              Results:                    Two groups of twelve models were trained and tested. The artificial neural network (ANN) model performed the best in the machine learning group (F1 score, 70.87%; MCC, 50.37%; and AUC score, 0.7939). The LogitBoost model obtained the best scores in the ensemble learning group (F1 score, 70.57%; MCC, 50.75%; and AUC score, 0.7907). After the comparison between the two models, the LogitBoost model was recognized as an optimal one.              Conclusion:                    In this study, NC-IVF-related datasets were extracted from the HFEA data, and a machine learning-based prediction model was successfully constructed through this largest NC-IVF dataset currently. This model is universal and stable, which can help clinicians predict the live-birth success rate of NC-IVF in advance before developing IVF treatment strategies and then choose the best benefit treatment strategy according to the patients' wishes. As ""use less stimulation and back to natural condition"" becomes more and more popular, this model is more meaningful in the decision-making assistance system for IVF.",-1
A Review of Metabolic Targets of Anticancer Nutrients and Nutraceuticals in Pre-Clinical Models of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that is notoriously aggressive and has poorer outcomes as compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Due to a lack of targeted therapies, TNBC is often treated with chemotherapeutics as opposed to hormone therapy or other targeted therapies available to individuals with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers. Because of the lack of treatment options for TNBC, other therapeutic avenues are being explored. Metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark of cancer, provides potential opportunities to target cancer cells more specifically, increasing efficacy and reducing side effects. Nutrients serve a significant role in metabolic processes involved in DNA transcription, protein folding, and function as co-factors in enzyme activity, and may provide novel strategies to target cancer cell metabolism in TNBC. This article reviews studies that have investigated how nutrients/nutraceuticals target metabolic processes in TNBC cells alone or in combination with existing drugs to exert anticancer effects. These agents have been shown to cause perturbations in many metabolic processes related to glucose metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, as well as autophagy and oxidative stress-related metabolism. With this information, we present the potential of nutrients as metabolism-directed anticancer agents and the potential for using these agents alone or in cocktails as a new direction for TNBC therapy.",-1
Anopheles arabiensis hotspots along intermittent rivers drive malaria dynamics in semi-arid areas of Central Ethiopia,"Background:                    Understanding malaria vector's population dynamics and their spatial distribution is important to define when and where the largest infection risks occur and implement appropriate control strategies. In this study, the seasonal spatio-temporal dynamics of the malaria vector population and transmission intensity along intermittent rivers in a semi-arid area of central Ethiopia were investigated.              Methods:                    Mosquitoes were collected monthly from five clusters, 2 close to a river and 3 away from a river, using pyrethrum spray catches from November 2014 to July 2016. Mosquito abundance was analysed by the mixed Poisson regression model. The human blood index and sporozoite rate was compared between seasons by a logistic regression model.              Results:                    A total of 2784 adult female Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) were collected during the data collection period. All tested mosquitoes (n = 696) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis by polymerase chain reaction. The average daily household count was significantly higher (P = 0.037) in the clusters close to the river at 5.35 (95% CI 2.41-11.85) compared to the clusters away from the river at 0.033 (95% CI 0.02-0.05). Comparing the effect of vicinity of the river by season, a significant effect of closeness to the river was found during the dry season (P = 0.027) and transition from dry to wet season (P = 0.032). Overall, An. arabiensis had higher bovine blood index (62.8%) as compared to human blood index (23.8%), ovine blood index (9.2%) and canine blood index (0.1%). The overall sporozoite rate was 3.9% and 0% for clusters close to and away from the river, respectively. The overall Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax entomologic inoculation rates for An. arabiensis in clusters close to the river were 0.8 and 2.2 infective bites per person/year, respectively.              Conclusion:                    Mosquito abundance and malaria transmission intensity in clusters close to the river were higher which could be attributed to the riverine breeding sites. Thus, vector control interventions including targeted larval source management should be implemented to reduce the risk of malaria infection in the area.",-1
The Association of Adiponectin and Visceral Fat with Insulin Resistance and Î²-Cell Dysfunction,"Background:                    Obesity is a risk factor for metabolic abnormalities. We investigated the relationship of adiponectin levels and visceral adiposity with insulin resistance and Î²-cell dysfunction.              Methods:                    This cross-sectional study enrolled 1,347 participants (501 men and 846 women aged 30-64 years) at the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Etiology Research Center. Serum adiponectin levels and visceral fat were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Insulin resistance was evaluated using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and Matsuda insulin sensitivity index. Î²-cell dysfunction was evaluated using the homeostatic model assessment of Î²-cell function (HOMA-Î²), insulinogenic index, and disposition index.              Results:                    Regarding insulin resistance, compared with individuals with the highest adiponectin levels and visceral fat mass < 75th percentile, the fully adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for HOMA-IR â?2.5 and Matsuda index < 25th percentile were 13.79 (95% confidence interval, 7.65-24.83) and 8.34 (4.66-14.93), respectively, for individuals with the lowest adiponectin levels and visceral fat â?75th percentile. Regarding Î²-cell dysfunction, the corresponding ORs for HOMA-Î² < 25th percentile, insulinogenic index < 25th percentile, and disposition index < 25th percentile were 1.20 (0.71-2.02), 1.01 (0.61-1.66), and 1.87 (1.15-3.04), respectively.              Conclusion:                    Low adiponectin levels and high visceral adiposity might affect insulin resistance and Î²-cell dysfunction.",-1
Convolutional neural network ensemble for Parkinson's disease detection from voice recordings,"The computerized detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) will facilitate population screening and frequent monitoring and provide a more objective measure of symptoms, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers. Dysarthria is an early symptom of the disease and examining it for computerized diagnosis and monitoring has been proposed. Deep learning-based approaches have advantages for such applications because they do not require manual feature extraction, and while this approach has achieved excellent results in speech recognition, its utilization in the detection of pathological voices is limited. In this work, we present an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of PD from the voice recordings of 50 healthy people and 50 people with PD obtained from PC-GITA, a publicly available database. We propose a multiple-fine-tuning method to train the base CNN. This approach reduces the semantical gap between the source task that has been used for network pretraining and the target task by expanding the training process by including training on another dataset. Training and testing were performed for each vowel separately, and a 10-fold validation was performed to test the models. The performance was measured by using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the ROC curve (AUC). The results show that this approach was able to distinguish between the voices of people with PD and those of healthy people for all vowels. While there were small differences between the different vowels, the best performance was when/a/was considered; we achieved 99% accuracy, 86.2% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity and 89.6% AUC. This shows that the method has potential for use in clinical practice for the screening, diagnosis and monitoring of PD, with the advantage that vowel-based voice recordings can be performed online without requiring additional hardware.",-1
Peptide Antibody Reactivity to Homologous Regions in Glutamate Decarboxylase Isoforms and Coxsackievirus B4 P2C,"Two isoforms of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) enzyme exist, GAD65 and GAD67, which are associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and stiff-person syndrome (SPS), respectively. Interestingly, it has been reported that T1D patients seldom develop SPS, whereas patients with SPS occasionally develop T1D. In addition, coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) has previously been proposed to be involved in the onset of T1D through molecular mimicry. On this basis, we aimed to examine antibody cross-reactivity between a specific region of GAD65 and GAD67, which has high sequence homology to the nonstructural P2C protein of CVB4 to determine potential correlations at antibody level. Monoclonal peptide antibodies generated in mice specific for a region with high similarity in all three proteins were screened for reactivity along with human sera in immunoassays. In total, six antibodies were generated. Two of the antibodies reacted to both GAD isoforms. However, none of the antibodies were cross-reactive to CVB, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity between GAD65 and CVB, and GAD67 and CVB may not contribute to the onset of T1D and SPS, respectively.",-1
"IGFBP-6: At the Crossroads of Immunity, Tissue Repair and Fibrosis","Insulin-like growth factors binding protein-6 (IGFBP-6) is involved in a relevant number of cellular activities and represents an important factor in the immune response, particularly in human dendritic cells (DCs). Over the past several years, significant insights into the IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-6 were discovered, such as the induction of chemotaxis, capacity to increase oxidative burst and neutrophils degranulation, ability to induce metabolic changes in DCs, and, more recently, the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway during fibrosis. IGFBP-6 has been implicated in different human diseases, and it plays a rather controversial role in the biology of tumors. Notably, well established relationships between immunity, stroma activity, and fibrosis are prognostic and predictive of response to cancer immunotherapy. This review aims at describing the current understanding of mechanisms that link IGFBP-6 and fibrosis development and at highlighting the multiple roles of IGFBP-6 to provide an insight into evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that can be relevant for inflammation, tumor immunity, and immunological diseases.",-1
Gut microbiota mediates the alleviative effect of polar lipids-enriched milk fat globule membrane on obesity-induced glucose metabolism disorders in peripheral tissues in rat dams,"Background:                    Obesity during pregnancy and lactation not only increases the incidence of metabolic disorders and gestational diabetes in mothers, but also programs adiposity and related metabolic diseases in offspring. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of milk polar lipids on gut microbiota and glucose metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rat dams.              Methods:                    Sprague Dawley (SD) female rats were fed a HFD for 8 weeks to induce obesity, followed by HFD with or without oral administration of polar lipids-enriched milk fat globule membrane (MFGM-PL) at 400 mg/kg BW during pregnancy and lactation. At the end of lactation, fresh fecal samples of dams were collected, the gut microbiota was assessed, and the insulin-signaling protein expression in peripheral tissues (adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle) were measured.              Results:                    MFGM-PL supplementation attenuated body weight gain, ameliorated serum lipid profiles and improved insulin sensitivity in obese dams at the end of lactation. 16 S rDNA sequencing revealed that MFGM-PL increased the community richness and diversity of gut microbiota. The composition of gut microbiota was also changed after MFGM-PL supplementation as shown by an increase in the ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes and the relative abundance of Akkermansia, as well as a decrease in the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae. The functional prediction of microbial communities by PICRUSt analysis showed that there were 7 KEGG pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism changed after MFGM-PL supplementation to HFD dams, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, MFGM-PL improved insulin signaling in the peripheral tissues including liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.              Conclusions:                    MFGM-PL supplementation during pregnancy and lactation improves the glucose metabolism disorders in HFD-induced obese dams, which may be linked to the regulation of gut microbiota induced by MFGM-PL.",-1
The impact of sublethal permethrin exposure on susceptible and resistant genotypes of the urban disease vector Aedes aegypti,"Background:                    In urban environments, some of the most common control tools used against the mosquito disease vector Aedes aegypti are pyrethroid insecticides applied as aerosols, fogs or residual sprays. Their efficacy is compromised by patchy deployment, aging residues, and the evolution and invasion of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. A large proportion of mosquitoes in a given environment will therefore receive sublethal doses of insecticide. The potential impact of this sublethal exposure on the behaviour and biology of Ae. aegypti carrying commonly reported resistance alleles is poorly documented.              Results:                    In susceptible insects, sublethal exposure to permethrin resulted in reductions in egg viability (13.9%), blood avidity (16.7%) and male mating success (28.3%). It caused a 70% decrease in the lifespan of exposed susceptible females and a 66% decrease in the insecticide-resistant females from the parental strain. Exposure to the same dose of insecticide in the presence of the isolated kdr genotype resulted in a smaller impact on female longevity (a 58% decrease) but a 26% increase in eggs per female and a 37% increase in male mating success. Sublethal permethrin exposure reduced host-location success by 20-30% in all strains.              Conclusion:                    The detrimental effects of exposure on susceptible insects were expected, but resistant insects demonstrated a less predictable range of responses, including negative effects on longevity and host-location but increases in fecundity and mating competitiveness. Overall, sublethal insecticide exposure is expected to increase the competitiveness of resistant phenotypes, acting as a selection pressure for the evolution of permethrin resistance.

Anchoring Î²-CD on simvastatin-loaded rHDL for selective cholesterol crystals dissolution and enhanced anti-inflammatory effects in macrophage/foam cells,"Macrophage/foam cells and cholesterol crystals (CCs) have been regarded as the central triggers of maladaptive inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque. Despite the tremendous progress of recombinant high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) serving for targeted drug delivery to alleviate inflammation in macrophage/foam cells, the active attempt to modulate/improve its CCs dissolution capacity remains poorly explored. The untreated CCs can seriously aggravate inflammation and threaten plaque stability. Based on the superb ability of Î²-cyclodextrin (Î²-CD) to bind CCs and promote cholesterol efflux, simvastatin-loaded discoidal-rHDL (ST-d-rHDL) anchored with Î²-CD (Î²CD-ST-d-rHDL) was constructed. We verified that Î²CD-ST-d-rHDL specifically bound and dissolved CCs extracellularly and intracellularly. Furthermore, anchoring Î²-CD onto the surface of ST-d-rHDL enhanced its cholesterol removal ability in RAW 264.7 cell-derived foam cells characterized by accelerated cholesterol efflux, reduced intracellular lipid deposition, and improved cell membrane fluidity/permeability. Finally, Î²CD-ST-d-rHDL exerted efficient drug delivery and effective anti-inflammatory effects in macrophage/foam cells. Collectively, anchoring Î²-CD onto the surface of ST-d-rHDL for selective CCs dissolution, accelerated cholesterol efflux, and improved drug delivery represents an effective strategy to enhance anti-inflammatory effects for the therapy of atherosclerosis.",-1
CircTHBS1 drives gastric cancer progression by increasing INHBA mRNA expression and stability in a ceRNA- and RBP-dependent manner,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital regulatory roles in the progression of multiple cancers. In our study, transcriptome analysis and self-organizing maps (SOM) were applied to screen backbone circRNAs in gastric cancer (GC). Upon validation of the expression patterns of screened circRNAs, gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed in vitro and in vivo. Underlying mechanisms were investigated using RNA pull-down, luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. The expression of circTHBS1 was significantly increased in GC and associated with poor prognosis. CircTHBS1 facilitated the malignant behavior and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of GC cells. Mechanistically, circTHBS1 sponged miR-204-5p to promote the expression of Inhibin Subunit Beta A (INHBA). Moreover, circTHBS1 could enhance the HuR-mediated mRNA stability of INHBA, which subsequently activated the TGF-Î² pathway. Our research identified circTHBS1 as an oncogenic circRNA that enhances GC malignancy by elevating INHBA expression, providing new insight and a feasible target for the diagnosis and treatment of GC.",-1
Comprehensive Surveillance of Virus Infection among Captive African Pygmy Hedgehogs in Japan,"African pygmy hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris) are popular exotic pets in Japan, and their breeding numbers have recently increased. Although various diseases have been reported in hedgehogs, including skin, respiratory, neurological, and neoplastic diseases, most of the causes remain unidentified. In this study, we investigated herpesvirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus infections among 150 African pygmy hedgehogs in Japan and evaluated the correlations between virus infection and diseases. A novel herpesvirus named Atelerix albiventris herpesvirus 1 (AAHeV), and African pygmy hedgehog adenovirus 1 (AhAdV-1) were detected in 14 and 3 oral swab samples, respectively. AAHeV infection may be related to neurological clinical signs. Interestingly, no hedgehog with a neoplastic disorder tested positive for AAHeV. Further research is required to determine the pathogenicity and prevalence of the detected viruses.",-1
Maternal heat stress regulates the early fat deposition partly through modification of m 6 A RNA methylation in neonatal piglets,"It is known that heat stress induces various physiological challenges in livestock production including changes in lipid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism of how heat stress regulates lipid metabolism at the mRNA level is still largely unknown. N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most common and abundant modification on RNA molecules present in eukaryotes, which affects almost all aspects of RNA metabolism and thus gives us the hint that it may participate in changes of gene expression of lipid metabolism during heat stress. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of heat stress on fat metabolism in 21-day Large White Ã Landrace piglets from sows challenged by heat stress from day 85 of gestation until day 21 of lactation. We measured the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), genes associated with lipid metabolism, m6A-related enzymes, and m6A levels in abdominal fat and liver of offspring piglets. Our results showed that high ambient temperature significantly increased the expression of HSP70 (P < 0.01) in both liver and abdominal fat and upregulated HSP27 in the liver (P < 0.05). Additionally, genes involved in fat metabolism such as ACACA, FASN, DGAT1, PPAR-Î³, SREBP-1c, and FABP4 were upregulated in abdominal fat in the experimental group challenged by high ambient temperature. In the liver, heat stress increased the mRNA expression of DGAT1, SREBP-1c, and CD36 and decreased ATGL and CPT1A expression (P < 0.05). The m6A level was higher in the heat stress group compared with the control group in the liver and abdominal fat of offspring piglets (P < 0.01). Notably, heat stress also increased gene expression of METTL14, WTAP, FTO, and YTHDF2 (P < 0.05) in both abdominal fat and liver. The protein abundances of METTL3, METTL14, and FTO were upregulated after heat stress in abdominal fat (P < 0.05) but not in the liver. Although there was no difference in the protein abundance of YTHDF2 in abdominal fat, its level was increased in the liver (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings showed that heat stress increased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, which provided scientific evidence to the observation of increased fatness in pigs under heat stress. We also demonstrated a possible mechanism that m6A RNA modification may be associated with these changes in lipid metabolism upon heat stress.",-1
Parasite-Probiotic Interactions in the Gut: Bacillus sp. and Enterococcus faecium Regulate Type-2 Inflammatory Responses and Modify the Gut Microbiota of Pigs During Helminth Infection,"Dietary probiotics may enhance gut health by directly competing with pathogenic agents and through immunostimulatory effects. These properties are recognized in the context of bacterial and viral pathogens, but less is known about interactions with eukaryotic pathogens such as parasitic worms (helminths). In this study we investigated whether two probiotic mixtures (comprised of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, and Enterococcus faecium [BBE], or Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG and Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies Lactis Bb12 [LB]) could modulate helminth infection kinetics as well as the gut microbiome and intestinal immune responses in pigs infected with the nodular worm Oesophagostomum dentatum. We observed that neither probiotic mixture influenced helminth infection levels. BBE, and to a lesser extent LB, changed the alpha- and beta-diversity indices of the colon and fecal microbiota, notably including an enrichment of fecal Bifidobacterium spp. by BBE. However, these effects were muted by concurrent O. dentatum infection. BBE (but not LB) significantly attenuated the O. dentatum-induced upregulation of genes involved in type-2 inflammation and restored normal lymphocyte ratios in the ileo-caecal lymph nodes that were altered by infection. Moreover, inflammatory cytokine release from blood mononuclear cells and intestinal lymphocytes was diminished by BBE. Collectively, our data suggest that selected probiotic mixtures can play a role in maintaining immune homeostasis during type 2-biased inflammation. In addition, potentially beneficial changes in the microbiome induced by dietary probiotics may be counteracted by helminths, highlighting the complex inter-relationships that potentially exist between probiotic bacteria and intestinal parasites.",-1
Preservation by lyophilization of a human intestinal microbiota: influence of the cultivation pH on the drying outcome and re-establishment ability,"Faecal microbiota transplantation is an emerging medical concept for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. This concept, however, has disadvantages as low storability of stool and intensive donor screening. A solution to overcome these problems would be the preservation of an in vitro microbiota through freeze-drying. However, the influence of the entire preservation process, including cultivation and lyophilization, has not been assessed so far. In this study, the influences of the process steps cultivation, drying and re-cultivation were determined with cell count, production of metabolites, microbial composition and diversity in the system as evaluation criteria. All pH conditions resulted in stable, culturable communities after re-cultivation. Cell count, richness, diversity and microbial composition were affected by freeze-drying, but these effects were reversible and vanished during re-cultivation. Hence, the re-cultivated system did not differ from the system before drying. The metabolism, measured by short-chain fatty acids as indicators, showed slight changes due to natural dynamics. Consequently, the cultivation prior to drying was identified to have more influence than the drying itself on the preservation process and therefore the biggest potential for optimization. Hence, the highest similarity with the initial stool sample was obtained with pH 6.0 - 6.5 during cultivation.",-1
Metal Ions Induce Liquid Condensate Formation by the F Domain of Aedes aegypti Ecdysteroid Receptor. New Perspectives of Nuclear Receptor Studies,"The superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs), composed of ligand-activated transcription factors, is responsible for gene expression as a reaction to physiological and environmental changes. Transcriptional machinery may require phase separation to fulfil its role. Although NRs have a similar canonical structure, their C-terminal domains (F domains) are considered the least conserved and known regions. This article focuses on the peculiar molecular properties of the intrinsically disordered F domain of the ecdysteroid receptor from the Aedes aegypti mosquito (AaFEcR), the vector of the world's most devastating human diseases such as dengue and Zika. The His-Pro-rich segment of AaFEcR was recently shown to form the unique poly-proline helix II (PPII) in the presence of Cu2+. Here, using widefield microscopy of fluorescently labeled AaFEcR, Zn2+- and Cu2+-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) was observed for the first time for the members of NRs. The perspectives of this finding on future research on the F domain are discussed, especially in relation to other NR members.",-1
"Homocysteine, Vitamins B6 and Folic Acid in Experimental Models of Myocardial Infarction and Heart Failure-How Strong Is That Link?","Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and the main cause of disability. In the last decade, homocysteine has been found to be a risk factor or a marker for cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF). There are indications that vitamin B6 plays a significant role in the process of transsulfuration in homocysteine metabolism, specifically, in a part of the reaction in which homocysteine transfers a sulfhydryl group to serine to form Î±-ketobutyrate and cysteine. Therefore, an elevated homocysteine concentration (hyperhomocysteinemia) could be a consequence of vitamin B6 and/or folate deficiency. Hyperhomocysteinemia in turn could damage the endothelium and the blood vessel wall and induce worsening of atherosclerotic process, having a negative impact on the mechanisms underlying MI and HF, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and altered function of gasotransmitters. Given the importance of the vitamin B6 in homocysteine metabolism, in this paper, we review its role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, influencing the functions of gasotransmitters, and improving vasodilatation and coronary flow in animal models of MI and HF.",-1
A laboratory-based study to explore the use of honey-impregnated cards to detect chikungunya virus in mosquito saliva,"Mosquito control is implemented when arboviruses are detected in patients or in field-collected mosquitoes. However, mass screening of mosquitoes is usually laborious and expensive, requiring specialized expertise and equipment. Detection of virus in mosquito saliva using honey-impregnated filter papers seems to be a promising method as it is non-destructive and allows monitoring the viral excretion dynamics over time from the same mosquito. Here we test the use of filter papers to detect chikungunya virus in mosquito saliva in laboratory conditions, before proposing this method in large-scale mosquito surveillance programs. We found that 0.9 cm2 cards impregnated with a 50% honey solution could replace the forced salivation technique as they offered a viral RNA detection until 7 days after oral infection of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes with CHIKV.",-1
Gut bless you: The microbiota-gut-brain axis in irritable bowel syndrome,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common clinical label for medically unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, recently described as a disturbance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of this highly heterogeneous disorder remains elusive. However, a dramatic change in the understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms surfaced when the importance of gut microbiota protruded the scientific picture. Are we getting any closer to understanding IBS' etiology, or are we drowning in unspecific, conflicting data because we possess limited tools to unravel the cluster of secrets our gut microbiota is concealing? In this comprehensive review we are discussing some of the major important features of IBS and their interaction with gut microbiota, clinical microbiota-altering treatment such as the low FODMAP diet and fecal microbiota transplantation, neuroimaging and methods in microbiota analyses, and current and future challenges with big data analysis in IBS.",-1
Roles of the Core Components of the Mammalian miRISC in Chromatin Biology,"The Argonaute (AGO) and the Trinucleotide Repeat Containing 6 (TNRC6) family proteins are the core components of the mammalian microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), the machinery that mediates microRNA function in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic miRISC-mediated post-transcriptional gene repression has been established as the canonical mechanism through which AGO and TNRC6 proteins operate. However, growing evidence points towards an additional mechanism through which AGO and TNRC6 regulate gene expression in the nucleus. While several mechanisms through which miRISC components function in the nucleus have been described, in this review we aim to summarize the major findings that have shed light on the role of AGO and TNRC6 in mammalian chromatin biology and on the implications these novel mechanisms may have in our understanding of regulating gene expression.",-1
Early identification of ICU patients at risk of complications: Regularization based on robustness and stability of explanations,"The aim of this study is to build machine learning models to predict severe complications using administrative and clinical elements that are collected immediately after patient admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Risk models are of increasing importance in the ICU setting. However, they generally present the black-box issue because they do not provide meaningful information about the logic involved in patient-specific predictions. Fortunately, effective algorithms exist for explaining black-box models, and in practice, they offer valuable explanations for model predictions. These explanations are becoming essential to engender trust and accreditation to the model. However, once the model is implemented, a major issue is whether it will continue to employ the same prediction logic as originally intended to. To build our models, features are obtained from patient administrative data, laboratory results and vital signs available within the first hour after ICU admission. This enables our models to provide great anticipation because complications can occur at any moment during ICU stay. To build models that continue to work as originally designed we first propose to measure (i) how the provided explanations vary for different inputs (that is, robustness), and (ii) how the provided explanations change with models built from different patient sub-populations (that is, stability). Second, we employ these measures as regularization terms that are coupled with a feature selection procedure such that the final model provides predictions with more robust and stable explanations. Experiments were conducted on a dataset containing 6000 ICU admissions of 5474 patients. Results obtained on an external validation cohort of 1069 patients with 1086 ICU admissions showed that selecting features based on robustness led to gains in terms of predictive power that varied from 6.8% to 9.4%, whereas selecting features based on stability led to gains that varied from 7.2% to 11.5%, depending on the target complication. Our results are of practical importance as our models predict complications with great anticipation, thus facilitating timely and protective interventions.",-1
Development and application of SYBR Green â?real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR assay for detection of swine Getah virus,"Getah virus (GETV), a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the Alphavirus genus of family Togaviridae, has become increasingly problematic, which poses a huge threat to the safety of animals and public health. In order to detect GETV quickly and accurately, we have developed a SYBR Green I real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for GETV with the detection limit of 66 copies/Î¼L, excellent correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9975, and amplification efficiency (E) of 98.90%, the target selected was the non-structural protein 3 of GETV. The sensitivity of it was higher than that of ordinary RT-PCR by 1000 folds, and the inter-assay and intra-assay CV values were all less than 0.99%. The newly developed RT-qPCR assay exhibited good sensitivity and reproducibility, which will provide technical support for the reliable and specific rapid diagnosis, and quantitative analysis of GETV infection.",-1
Biomechanical responses of Nordic walking in people with Parkinson's disease,"In healthy adults, Nordic walking (NW) is known to increase the external mechanical energy fluctuations, though the external work is unaltered due to an improved pendulum-like recovery in comparison with free walking (FW). We aimed to compare mechanical, pendulum-like, and spatiotemporal parameters of gait at different speeds with and without NW poles in people with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. The study included 11 people (aged 65.6 Â± 7.0 years) with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, scoring between 1 and 1.5 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y), and nine healthy controls (aged 70.0 Â± 5.6 years). All the people were experienced Nordic walkers. Walking tests were performed at 1.8 km h-1 and 4.7 km h-1 , on eight 3D force platforms on a walkway. We found greater pendulum-like energy recovery (p < 0.05) in the Parkinson group during NW than in FW, while external mechanical work remained similar (p > 0.05). People with Parkinson's disease showed a major increase in vertical and forward energy fluctuations using poles than in healthy controls. In addition, the Parkinson group showed increased stride frequency and reduced stride length compared to controls in the NW and FW conditions. Our findings partly justify the lower walking economy in Parkinson's disease due to reduced pendulum-like mechanism at commonly used speeds. NW alters gait mechanics similarly in Parkinson group and healthy control, increasing the total mechanical work. Therefore, NW can be a compelling strategy for rehabilitation because of its potential for improving functional mobility, increasing pendulum-like mechanism in Parkinson's disease.",-1
Ab initio neural network MD simulation of thermal decomposition of a high energy material CL-20/TNT,"CL-20 (2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane, also known as HNIW) is one of the most powerful energetic materials. However, its high sensitivity to environmental stimuli greatly reduces its safety and severely limits its application. In this work, ab initio based neural network potential (NNP) energy surfaces for both Î²-CL-20 and CL-20/TNT co-crystals were constructed. To accurately simulate the thermal decomposition processes of these two crystal systems, reactive molecular dynamics simulations based on the NNPs were performed. Many important intermediate species and their associated reaction paths during the decomposition had been identified in the simulations and the direct results on detonation temperatures of both systems were provided. The simulations also showed clearly that 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) molecules in the co-crystal act as a buffer to slow down the chain reactions triggered by nitrogen dioxide and this effect is more significant at lower temperatures. Specifically, the addition of TNT molecules in the CL-20/TNT co-crystal introduces intermolecular hydrogen bonds between CL-20 and TNT molecules in the system, thereby increasing the thermal stability of the co-crystal. The current reactive molecular dynamics simulation is performed based on the NNP which helps in accelerating the speed of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation by more than 3 orders of magnitude while preserving the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This enabled us to perform longer-time simulations at more realistic temperatures that traditional AIMD methods cannot achieve. With the advantage of the NNP in its powerful fitting ability and transferability, the NNP-based MD simulation can be widely applied to energetic material systems.",-1
Cost and cost-effectiveness of indoor residual spraying with pirimiphos-methyl in a high malaria transmission district of Mozambique with high access to standard insecticide-treated nets,"Background:                    As malaria cases increase in some of the highest burden countries, more strategic deployment of new and proven interventions must be evaluated to meet global malaria reduction goals.              Methods:                    The cost and cost-effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) with pirimiphos-methyl (ActellicÂ®300 CS) were assessed in a high transmission district (Mopeia) with high access to pyrethroid insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), compared to ITNs alone. The major mosquito vectors in the area were susceptible to primiphos-methyl, but resistant to pyrethoids. A decision analysis approach was followed to conduct deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses in a theoretical cohort of 10,000 children under five years of age (U5) and 10,000 individuals of all ages, separately. Model parameters and distributions were based on prospectively collected cost and epidemiological data from a cluster-randomized control trial and a literature review. The primary analysis used health facility-malaria incidence, while community cohort incidence and cross-sectional prevalence rates were used in sensitivity analyses. Lifetime costs, malaria cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated to determine the incremental costs per DALY averted through IRS.              Results:                    The average IRS cost per person protected was US$8.26 and 51% of the cost was insecticide. IRS averted 46,609 (95% CI 46,570-46,646) uncomplicated and 242 (95% CI 241-243) severe lifetime cases in a theoretical children U5 cohort, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$400 (95% CI 399-402) per DALY averted. In the all-age cohort, the ICER was higher: US$1,860 (95% CI 1,852-1,868) per DALY averted. Deterministic and probabilistic results were consistent. When adding the community protective effect of IRS, the cost per person protected decreased (US$7.06) and IRS was highly cost-effective in children U5 (ICER = US$312) and cost-effective in individuals of all ages (ICER = US$1,431), compared to ITNs alone.              Conclusion:                    This study provides robust evidence that IRS with pirimiphos-methyl can be cost-effective in high transmission regions with high pyrethroid ITN coverage where the major vector is susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl but resistant to pyrethroids. The finding that insecticide cost is the main driver of IRS costs highlights the need to reduce the insecticide price without jeopardizing effectiveness.

Endoscopic Characteristics of Dysphagia in Multiple System Atrophy Compared to Parkinson's Disease,"Background:                    Dysphagia is a major clinical concern in multiple system atrophy (MSA). A detailed evaluation of its major endoscopic features compared with Parkinson's disease (PD) is lacking.              Objective:                    This study systematically assessed dysphagia in MSA compared with PD and correlated subjective dysphagia to objective endoscopic findings.              Methods:                    Fifty-seven patients with MSA (median, 64 [interquartile range (IQR): 59-71] years; 35 women) underwent flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing using a specific MSA-flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing task protocol. Findings were compared with an age-matched cohort of 57 patients with PD (median, 67 [interquartile range: 60-73] years; 28 women). In a subcohort, subjective dysphagia was assessed using the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire and correlated to endoscopy findings.              Results:                    Patients with MSA predominantly showed symptoms suggestive of oral-phase disturbance (premature spillage, 75.4%, piecemeal deglutition, 75.4%). Pharyngeal-phase symptoms occurred less often (pharyngeal residues, 50.9%; penetration/aspiration, 28.1%). In contrast, pharyngeal symptoms were the most common finding in PD (pharyngeal residues, 47.4%). Oral symptoms occurred less frequently in PD (premature spillage, 15.8%, P < 0.001; piecemeal deglutition, 1.8%, P < 0.01). Patients with MSA had a greater risk for oral-phase disturbances with increased disease severity (P < 0.05; odds ratio, 3.15). Patients with MSA showed a significantly higher intraindividual interswallow variability compared with PD. When correlating Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire scores with endoscopy results, its cutoff, validated for PD, was not sensitive enough to identify patients with MSA with dysphagia. We developed a subscore for identifying dysphagia in MSA and calculated a new cutoff (sensitivity 85%, specificity 100%).              Conclusions:                    In contrast with patients with PD, patients with dysphagic MSA more frequently present with oral-phase symptoms and a significantly higher intraindividual interswallow variability. A novel Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire MSA subscore may be a valuable tool to identify patients with MSA with early oropharyngeal dysphagia. Â© 2021 The Authors.

Effects of fasting during Ramadan on seizure control and quality of life in patients with epilepsy,"Background:                    During Ramadan, the ninth month of the lunar Islamic calendar, adult Muslims are obliged to fast, which involves refraining from taking any food, beverages, or oral medications from dawn to sunset. Fasting's effect on seizure control is not fully understood, and a few observational studies have provided inconclusive results. This study aimed to investigate the effect of fasting during Ramadan on seizure control and quality of life in adult patients with epilepsy.              Methods:                    This was a prospective observational study over a 3-month period (one month before fasting, the fasting month, and one month after fasting). We recruited adult patients with active epilepsy who were able to fast during the month of Ramadan. The primary outcome measures were as follows: 1) seizure control and 2) quality of life score using the Arabic version of the Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index (QLI). Changes in anticonvulsant medications were not allowed during the study period. We used a seizure log provided to participants to record the number of seizures during the 3-month period. Quality of life was scored at the end of each month of the study period.              Results:                    Thirty-seven patients were studied (59% males). The mean age was 30 years (range, 14-51 years), and mean age at epilepsy onset was 13 years (range, 0.5-35 years). On average, patients were on three antiepileptic medications at baseline (range: 2-5). A total of 1576 seizures were reported during the 3-month follow-up, where seizures prior to fasting represented 35.5% of all seizures. Multilinear regression analysis revealed a significant decline of seizures by 21% during the fasting month compared with baseline (adjusted coefficient = 0.79, p < 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI); 0.61-0.98, R2 = 0.81) and by 29% during post fasting compared with baseline (adjusted coefficient = 0.71, p < 0.01, 95% CI; 0.53-0.90, R2 = 0.79). No significant change was found in the QLI scores calculated during the three months of the study period.              Conclusion:                    Fasting during Ramadan might have a positive impact on seizure control in patients with epilepsy, which continued during the month following fasting, whereas the quality of life scores were not affected by fasting.",-1
"Profile of Small RNAs, vDNA Forms and Viral Integrations in Late Chikungunya Virus Infection of Aedes albopictus Mosquitoes","The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is contributing to the (re)-emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). To gain insights into the molecular underpinning of viral persistence, which renders a mosquito a life-long vector, we coupled small RNA and whole genome sequencing approaches on carcasses and ovaries of mosquitoes sampled 14 days post CHIKV infection and investigated the profile of small RNAs and the presence of vDNA fragments. Since Aedes genomes harbor nonretroviral Endogenous Viral Elements (nrEVEs) which confers tolerance to cognate viral infections in ovaries, we also tested whether nrEVEs are formed after CHIKV infection. We show that while small interfering (si)RNAs are evenly distributed along the full viral genome, PIWI-interacting (pi)RNAs mostly arise from a ~1000 bp window, from which a unique vDNA fragment is identified. CHIKV infection does not result in the formation of new nrEVEs, but piRNAs derived from existing nrEVEs correlate with differential expression of an endogenous transcript. These results demonstrate that all three RNAi pathways contribute to the homeostasis during the late stage of CHIKV infection, but in different ways, ranging from directly targeting the viral sequence to regulating the expression of mosquito transcripts and expand the role of nrEVEs beyond immunity against cognate viruses.",-1
Contribution of epicardial and abdominopelvic visceral adipose tissues in Chinese adults with impaired glucose regulation and diabetes,"Aims:                    To quantify epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in Chinese adults with impaired glucose regulation (IGR) or diabetes and compare the contributions of EAT and VAT to the occurrence of IGR and diabetes with those of traditional obesity indices.              Methods:                    Cardiac and abdominopelvic noncontrast computed tomographic images of 668 individuals were used to measure EAT and VAT volume. Multivariable logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to illustrate the contributions of these tissues.              Results:                    Patients with IGR or diabetes had larger EAT and VAT volumes than did the controls, and the VAT volume was significantly different between the IGR and diabetic groups. In multivariable models, higher EAT or VAT volume was positively associated with the presence of IGR and diabetes. After adjusting further for body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a higher EAT volume was still positively associated with IGR (odds ratio (OR) = 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-2.03), and a higher VAT volume was positively associated with IGR (OR = 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15-3.02) and diabetes (OR = 1.86; 95% CI, 1.16-2.99). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the association of EAT (AUC = 0.751; 95% CI, 0.712-0.789) and VAT (AUC = 0.752; 95% CI, 0.713-0.792) with dysglycemia (IGR + diabetes) were significantly larger than those of the traditional obesity indices (all P < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    High EAT or VAT volume is positively associated with IGR and diabetes in Chinese adults. With a given WHR and BMI, such an association still exists to some extent. The correlation may be stronger than those of the traditional obesity indices.",-1
Neuroprotection of chicoric acid in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease involves gut microbiota and TLR4 signaling pathway,"Chicoric acid (CA), a polyphenolic acid obtained from chicory and purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), has been regarded as a nutraceutical to combat inflammation, viruses and obesity. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the potential mechanism in the pathogenesis and development of PD. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that oral pretreatments of CA significantly prevented the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor dysfunctions and death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons along with the inhibition of glial hyperactivation and the increment in striatal neurotrophins. 16S rRNA sequence results showed that CA significantly reduced MPTP-induced microbial dysbiosis and partially restored the composition of the gut microbiota to normal, including decreased phylum Bacteroidetes and genera Parabacteroide, as well as increased phylum Firmicutes, genera Lactobacillus and Ruminiclostridium. Besides, CA promoted colonic epithelial integrity and restored normal SCFA production. We also observed that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the serum, striatum and colon were reduced by CA, indicating that CA prevented neuroinflammation and gut inflammation, in which the suppression of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway might be the underlying molecular mechanism. These findings demonstrated that CA had neuroprotective effects on MPTP-induced PD mice possibly via modulating the gut microbiota and inhibiting inflammation throughout the brain-gut axis.",-1
Respiratory disorders of Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, mainly affecting people over 60 yr of age. Patients develop both classic symptoms (tremors, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and nonclassical symptoms (orthostatic hypotension, neuropsychiatric deficiency, sleep disturbances, and respiratory disorders). Thus, patients with PD can have a significantly impaired quality of life, especially when they do not have multimodality therapeutic follow-up. The respiratory alterations associated with this syndrome are the main cause of mortality in PD. They can be classified as peripheral when caused by disorders of the upper airways or muscles involved in breathing and as central when triggered by functional deficits of important neurons located in the brainstem involved in respiratory control. Currently, there is little research describing these disorders, and therefore, there is no well-established knowledge about the subject, making the treatment of patients with respiratory symptoms difficult. In this review, the history of the pathology and data about the respiratory changes in PD obtained thus far will be addressed.",-1
Therapeutic and technological advancements in haemophilia care: Quantum leaps forward,"Introduction:                    Recent technological innovations in haemophilia have advanced at an astounding pace, including gene therapy programmes and bioengineered molecules for prophylaxis, products that reduce treatment burden through half-life extension, unique mechanisms of action, and subcutaneous administration. Additional technological advancements have emerged that are anticipated to further transform haemophilia care.              Aim:                    Review new and emerging haemophilia therapies, including replacement and bypassing products, digital applications, utilisation of big data, and personalised medicine.              Methods:                    Data were obtained from peer-reviewed presentations/publications, and ongoing studies in haemophilia, ultrasonography, and artificial intelligence (AI).              Results:                    Available treatments include new recombinant factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX), extended half-life FVIII/IX products, a new FVIIa product for inhibitor patients, and a FVIIIa-mimetic. Several novel therapeutics are in clinical trials, including FVIIIa mimetics and inhibitors of naturally-occurring anticoagulants. Ongoing gene therapy trials suggest that a single vector infusion using an optimised construct can produce factor activity that reduces bleeding to near zero for years. Today, persons with haemophilia (PwH) approach a lifespan comparable to that of the general population, presenting treatment challenges for age-related co-morbidities. Technological innovations have broadened beyond therapeutics to include large database analyses utilising remote data collection with handheld devices, and to tailor AI applications. Current development efforts include patient-performed ultrasonography, algorithms for scan interpretation, and point-of-care haemostatic testing devices.              Conclusions:                    We have entered a golden age for haemophilia treatment and care with wide-ranging advancements targeting improved quality of life (QoL). Future-focused efforts by clinical and patient communities may provide equitable access and care for people impacted by haemophilia worldwide.",-1
Cortical activation during gait adaptability in people with Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    People with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulties adapting their gait. While underlying neural mechanisms involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been studied across various complex walking tasks, less is known about the premotor cortex (PMC) and supplementary motor area (SMA), key cortical regions for motor planning. This study compared frontal cortical regions activation patterns using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), between people with PD and healthy controls (HC) during gait adaptability tasks.              Methods:                    Forty-nine people with PD (mean (SD) age: 69.5 (7.9) years) and 21 HC (69.0 (5.9) years) completed a simple walk and three randomly presented gait adaptability tasks: (i) stepping on targets, (ii) avoiding obstacles and (iii) negotiating both targets and obstacles. Cortical activity in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), SMA and PMC were recorded using fNIRS. Step length, velocity and accuracy and cortical activity were contrasted between the groups and walking conditions.              Results:                    Compared with the HC, the PD group exhibited greater PMC activation and walked significantly slower and took shorter steps in all conditions. A statistically significant group by condition interaction indicated an increase in DLPFC cortical activation in the HC participants when undertaking the obstacle avoidance task compared with the simple walk but no increase in cortical activation in the PD group when undergoing this more challenging gait task.              Conclusions:                    Our findings suggest people with PD have little or no DLPFC, SMA and PMC capacity beyond what they need for simple walking and in consequence need to slow their gait velocity to meet the demands of target stepping and obstacle avoidance tasks. Such behavioral and neural patterns appear consistent with concepts of compensatory over-activation and capacity limitation.",-1
The Extracellular Mass to Body Cell Mass Ratio as a Predictor of Mortality Risk in Hemodialysis Patients,"The extracellular mass/body cell mass ratio (ECM/BCM ratio) is a novel indicator of nutritional and hydration status in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This study aimed to explore the ECM/BCM ratio as a predictor of mortality risk with nutritional-inflammatory markers in HD patients. A prospective observational study was conducted in 90 HD patients (male: 52.2%; DM: 25.60%). Clinical and biochemical parameters [serum albumin, serum C-reactive protein (s-CRP), interleukine-6 (IL-6)] were analysed and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was performed. Protein-energy wasting syndrome (PEW) was diagnosed using malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS). Based on BIA-derived measurements, the ECM/BCM ratio with a cut-off point of 1.20 was used as a PEW-fluid overload indicator. Comorbidity by Charlson index and hospital admissions were measured. Out of 90 HD patients followed up for 36 months, 20 patients (22.22%) died. PEW was observed in 24 survivors (34.28%) and all non-survivors. The ECM/BCM ratio was directly correlated with MIS, s-CRP, Charlson index and hospital admissions but was negatively correlated with phase angle and s-albumin (all, p &lt; 0.001). Values of the ECM/BCM ratio â?1.20 were associated with higher probability of all-cause mortality (p = 0.002). The ECM/BCM ratio â?1.20, IL-6 â?3.1 pg/mL, s-CRP and s-albumin â?3.8 g/dL and Charlson index were significantly associated with all-cause mortality risk in multivariate adjusted analysis. This study demonstrates that the ECM/BCM ratio â?1.20 as a nutritional marker and/or fluid overload indicator had a significant prognostic value of death risk in HD patients.",-1
Community-wide seasonal shifts in thermal tolerances of mosquitoes,"The broadening in species' thermal tolerance limits and breadth from tropical to temperate latitudes is proposed to reflect spatial gradients in temperature seasonality, but the importance of seasonal shifts in thermal tolerances within and across locations is much less appreciated. We performed thermal assays to examine the maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin , respectively) of a mosquito community across their active seasons. Mosquito CTmin tracked seasonal shifts in temperature, whereas CTmax tracked a countergradient pattern with lowest heat tolerances in summer. Mosquito thermal breadth decreased from spring to summer and then increased from summer to autumn. We show a temporal dichotomy in thermal tolerances with thermal breadths of temperate organisms in summer reflecting those of the tropics (""tropicalization"") that is sandwiched between a spring and autumn ""temperatization."" Therefore, our tolerance patterns at a single temperate latitude recapitulate classical patterns across latitude. These findings highlight the need to understand the temporal and spatial components of thermotolerance variation better, including plasticity and rapid seasonal selection, and the potential for this variation to affect species responses to climate change. With summers becoming longer and increasing winter nighttime temperatures, we expect increasing tropicalization of species thermal tolerances in both space and time.",-1
Obesity and Dyslipidemia Synergistically Exacerbate Psoriatic Skin Inflammation,"Patients with psoriasis are frequently complicated with metabolic syndrome; however, it is not fully understood how obesity and dyslipidemia contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To investigate the mechanisms by which obesity and dyslipidemia exacerbate psoriasis using murine models and neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), we used wild-type and Apoe-deficient dyslipidemic mice, and administered a high-fat diet for 10 weeks to induce obesity. Imiquimod was applied to the ear for 5 days to induce psoriatic dermatitis. To examine the innate immune responses of NHEKs, we cultured and stimulated NHEKs using IL-17A, TNF-Î±, palmitic acid, and leptin. We found that obesity and dyslipidemia synergistically aggravated psoriatic dermatitis associated with increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Treatment of NHEKs with palmitic acid and leptin amplified pro-inflammatory responses in combination with TNF-Î± and IL-17A. Additionally, pretreatment with palmitic acid and leptin enhanced IL-17A-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. These results revealed that obesity and dyslipidemia synergistically exacerbate psoriatic skin inflammation, and that metabolic-disorder-associated inflammatory factors, palmitic acid, and leptin augment the activation of epidermal keratinocytes. Our results emphasize that management of concomitant metabolic disorders is essential for preventing disease exacerbation in patients with psoriasis.",-1
FBXO7 triggers caspase 8-mediated proteolysis of the transcription factor FOXO4 and exacerbates neuronal cytotoxicity,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Mutations in the F-box only protein 7 gene (Fbxo7) have been reported to cause an autosomal recessive form of early-onset familial PD. FBXO7 is a part of the SKP1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates ubiquitination of numerous substrates. FBXO7 also regulates mitophagy, cell growth, and proteasome activity. A member of the FOXO family, the transcription factor FOXO4, is also known to modulate several cellular responses, including cell cycle progression and apoptosis; however, the relationship between FBXO7 and FOXO4 has not been investigated. In this study, we determined that FBXO7 binds to FOXO4 and negatively regulates intracellular FOXO4 levels. Interestingly, we also found that FBXO7-mediated degradation of FOXO4 did not occur through either of two major proteolysis systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system or the lysosome-autophagy pathway, although it was blocked by a caspase 8-specific inhibitor and caspase 8-knockdown. Moreover, intracellular FOXO4 levels were greatly reduced in dopaminergic MN9D cells following treatment with neurotoxic 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which was produced upon FBXO7-mediated and caspase 8-mediated proteolysis. Taken together, these results suggest that FOXO4 is negatively regulated in FBXO7-linked PD through caspase 8 activation, suppressing the cytoprotective effect of FOXO4 during 6-OHDA-induced neuronal cell death.",-1
The proteasome-dependent degradation of ALKBH5 regulates ECM deposition in PM 2.5 exposure-induced pulmonary fibrosis of mice,"Long-term inhalation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can cause serious effects on the respiratory system. It might be attributed to the fact that PM2.5 could directly enter and deposit in lung tissues. We established models of PM2.5 exposure in vivo and in vitro to explore the adverse effects of ambient PM2.5 on pulmonary and its potential pathogenic mechanisms. Our results showed that PM2.5 exposure promoted the deposition of ECM and the increased stiffness of the lungs, and then led to pulmonary fibrosis in time- and dose- dependent manners. Pulmonary function test showed restrictive ventilation function in mice after PM2.5 exposure. After PM2.5 exposure, ALKBH5 was recognized by TRIM11 and then degraded through the proteasome pathway. ALKBH5 deficiency (ALKBH5-/-) aggravated restrictive ventilatory disorder and promoted ECM deposition in lungs of mice induced by PM2.5. And the YAP1 signaling pathway was more activated in ALKBH5-/- than WT mice after PM2.5 exposure. In consequence, decreased ALKBH5 protein levels regulated miRNAs and then the miRNAs-targeted YAP1 signaling was activated to promote pulmonary fibrosis induced by PM2.5.",-1
Gut Microbial Signatures for Glycemic Responses of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Pilot Study,"Backgrounds:                    Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) is probably one of more effective antidiabetic agents in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). However, the heterogenicity in responses to GLP-1 RA may be potentially related to gut microbiota, although no human evidence has been published. This pilot study aims to identify microbial signatures associated with glycemic responses to GLP-1 RA.              Materials and methods:                    Microbial compositions of 52 patients with T2D receiving GLP-1 RA were determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Bacterial biodiversity was compared between responders versus non-responders. Pearson's correlation and random forest tree algorithm were used to identify microbial features of glycemic responses in T2D patients and multivariable linear regression models were used to validate clinical relevance.              Results:                    Beta diversity significantly differed between GLP-1 RA responders (n = 34) and non-responders (n = 18) (ADONIS, P = 0.004). The top 17 features associated with glycohemoglobin reduction had a 0.96 diagnostic ability, based on area under the ROC curve: Bacteroides dorei and Roseburia inulinivorans, the two microbes having immunomodulation effects, along with Lachnoclostridium sp. and Butyricicoccus sp., were positively correlated with glycemic reduction; Prevotella copri, the microbe related to insulin resistance, together with Ruminococcaceae sp., Bacteroidales sp., Eubacterium coprostanoligenes sp., Dialister succinatiphilus, Alistipes obesi, Mitsuokella spp., Butyricimonas virosa, Moryella sp., and Lactobacillus mucosae had negative correlation. Furthermore, Bacteroides dorei, Lachnoclostridium sp. and Mitsuokella multacida were significant after adjusting for baseline glycohemoglobin and C-peptide concentrations, two clinical confounders.              Conclusions:                    Unique gut microbial signatures are associated with glycemic responses to GLP-RA treatment and reflect degrees of dysbiosis in T2D patients.",-1
Protective effects of Forsythiae fructus and Cassiae semen water extract against memory deficits through the gut-microbiome-brain axis in an Alzheimer's disease model,"Context:                    Fruits of Forsythia suspensa Vahl (Oleaceae) and seeds of Cassia obtusifolia Linne (Caesalpinaceae) have been used to treat inflammation in Asia.              Objective:                    We examined the alleviation of memory function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats fed Forsythiae Fructus (FF) and Cassiae Semen water extracts (CS) and investigated the mechanisms responsible for the effects.              Materials and methods:                    Thirty Sprague-Dawley male rats had hippocampal infusions of amyloid-Î²(25-35) (AD rats; memory deficit), and ten rats were infused with amyloid-Î²(35-25) (non-AD rats; no memory deficit). For eight weeks, all rats freely consumed high-fat diets (43% lard) incorporated with 200 mg/kg body weight assigned aqueous herbal extracts: AD-FF, AD-CS, or without extracts AD-CON (control), non-AD (normal-control).              Results:                    Memory impairment was prevented in the AD-FF (0.54 Â± 0.06-fold) and the AD-CS rats (0.33 Â± 0.04-fold) compared to the AD-CON by inhibiting amyloid-Î² deposition to the levels less than one-fourth of the AD-CON group. The hippocampal pAktâpGSK-3Î²âpFOXO1 pathway was attenuated by approximately 3.25-fold in the AD-CON, while AD-FF prevented the attenuation better than AD-CS. The relative intensity of hippocampal tau protein based on Î²-actin was suppressed with AD-FF (0.68 Â± 0.09) and AD-CS (0.96 Â± 0.81), compared to AD-CON (1.19 Â± 0.13). AD decreased the abundance of Bacteroidales by 34.2% and Lactobacillales by 23.8% and increased Clostridiales by 181% while the AD-FF, but not the AD-CS, normalised the gut microbiota changes to be similar to the non-AD.              Discussion and conclusions:                    FF improved memory deficits better than CS in an AD-induced rat model. The potential neuroprotective benefits of FF against AD may be applicable to human AD therapy with additional clinical research.",-1
First probable case of congenital Zika syndrome in Lao People's Democratic Republic,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a Flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, and was responsible for a worldwide outbreak between 2013 and 2016. However, no ZIKV outbreak has been described in Southeast Asia since 2017. In this study, we report the first microcephaly case with probable ZIKV infection during pregnancy in Lao People's Democratic Republic.",-1
Single-Trajectory Multiple-Target Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinsonian Mobility and Cognition,"Background:                    Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) is an emerging target to potentially treat cognitive dysfunction.              Objectives:                    The aim of this study is to achieve feasibility and safety of globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) and NBM DBS in advanced PD with cognitive impairment.              Methods:                    We performed a phase-II double-blind crossover pilot trial in six participants to assess safety and cognitive measures, the acute effect of NBM stimulation on attention, motor and neuropsychological data at one year, and neuroimaging biomarkers of NBM stimulation.              Results:                    NBM DBS was well tolerated but did not improve cognition. GPi DBS improved dyskinesia and motor fluctuations (P = 0.04) at one year. NBM stimulation was associated with reduced right frontal and parietal glucose metabolism (P < 0.01) and increased low- and high-frequency power and functional connectivity. Volume of tissue activated in the left NBM was associated with stable cognition (P < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Simultaneous GPi and NBM stimulation is safe and improves motor complications. NBM stimulation altered neuroimaging biomarkers but without lasting cognitive improvement. Â© 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",-1
Gut microbiome of the largest living rodent harbors unprecedented enzymatic systems to degrade plant polysaccharides,"The largest living rodent, capybara, can efficiently depolymerize and utilize lignocellulosic biomass through microbial symbiotic mechanisms yet elusive. Herein, we elucidate the microbial community composition, enzymatic systems and metabolic pathways involved in the conversion of dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, a main energy source for the host. In this microbiota, the unconventional enzymatic machinery from Fibrobacteres seems to drive cellulose degradation, whereas a diverse set of carbohydrate-active enzymes from Bacteroidetes, organized in polysaccharide utilization loci, are accounted to tackle complex hemicelluloses typically found in gramineous and aquatic plants. Exploring the genetic potential of this community, we discover a glycoside hydrolase family of Î²-galactosidases (named as GH173), and a carbohydrate-binding module family (named as CBM89) involved in xylan binding that establishes an unprecedented three-dimensional fold among associated modules to carbohydrate-active enzymes. Together, these results demonstrate how the capybara gut microbiota orchestrates the depolymerization and utilization of plant fibers, representing an untapped reservoir of enzymatic mechanisms to overcome the lignocellulose recalcitrance, a central challenge toward a sustainable and bio-based economy.",-1
Effects of 8 wk of 16:8 Time-restricted Eating in Male Middle- and Long-Distance Runners,"Purpose:                    Eight weeks of time-restricted eating (TRE) in concert with habitual exercise training was investigated for effects on body composition, energy and macronutrient intakes, indices of endurance running performance, and markers of metabolic health in endurance athletes.              Methods:                    Male middle- and long-distance runners (n = 23) were randomly assigned to TRE (n = 12) or habitual dietary intake (CON; n = 11). TRE required participants to consume all of their dietary intake within an 8-h eating window (so-called 16:8 TRE), but dietary patterns, food choices, and energy intake were ad libitum during this window. Participants continued their habitual training during the intervention period. Participants completed an incremental exercise test before (PRE) and after (POST) the 8-wk intervention for the assessment of blood lactate concentrations, running economy, and maximal oxygen uptake. Fasted blood samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations. Dietary intake was assessed at PRE, MID (week 4), and POST using a 4-d semiweighed food diary.              Results:                    Seventeen participants (TRE, n = 10; CON, n = 7) completed the intervention. Training load did not differ between groups for the duration of the intervention period. TRE resulted in a reduction in body mass (mean difference of -1.92 kg, 95% confidence interval = -3.52 to -0.32, P = 0.022). Self-reported daily energy intake was lower in TRE at MID and POST (group-time interaction, P = 0.049). No effect of TRE was observed for oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, running economy, blood lactate concentrations, or heart rate during exercise, nor were there any effects on glucose, insulin, or triglyceride concentrations observed.              Conclusion:                    Eight weeks of 16:8 TRE in middle- and long-distance runners resulted in a decrease in body mass commensurate with a reduction in daily energy intake, but it did not alter indices of endurance running performance or metabolic health.",-1
Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is associated with executive dysfunction and poorer quality of life in progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome,"Background:                    Autonomic dysfunction in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is not uncommon but is easily neglected.              Objective:                    We evaluated blood pressure (BP) profiles in PSP patients and aimed to determine the associations between BP variability and cognition and quality of life.              Methods:                    Consecutive patients diagnosed with PSP were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, office blood pressure measurements, and comprehensive clinical assessments.              Results:                    We enrolled 31 PSP patients. Ten (32.3%) patients presented with reverse dipping, 10 (32.3%) presented with reduced dipping, and 11 (35.5%) presented with normal dipping. Additionally, 19 (61.3%) patients had supine hypertension, and no patients had orthostatic hypotension. In the entire PSP cohort, the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) score, Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) score, and daytime systolic BP (SBP) standard deviation explained 61.5% (adjusted R2) of the variance in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) scores. In the PSP with Richardson's syndrome group, the daytime SBP coefficient of variation and Mini-Mental State Examination score accounted for 33.9% of the variance in Frontal Assessment Battery scores. The MDS-UPDRS III score, 24-hour SBP coefficient of variation, and SCOPA-AUT score explained 77.6% of the variance in PDQ-39 scores.              Conclusions:                    Greater BP variability was associated with executive dysfunction and poorer quality of life in patients with PSP. A high prevalence of abnormal dipping patterns indicated circadian disruption in patients with PSP.",-1
"Evaluation of Molecular Test for the Discrimination of ""Naked"" DNA from Infectious Parvovirus B19 Particles in Serum and Bone Marrow Samples","Low levels of parvovirus B19 (B19V) DNA can be detected in the circulation and in different tissue of immunocompetent individuals for months or years, which has been linked to inflammatory diseases such as cardiomyopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, and vasculitis. However, the detection of B19V DNA does not necessarily imply that infectious virions are present. This study aimed to evaluate the method based on the BenzonaseÂ® treatment for differentiation between the infectious virions from ""naked"" DNA in serum and bone marrow (BM) samples to be useful for the B19V routine diagnosis. In addition, we estimated the period of viremia and DNAemia in the sera and bone marrow of nonhuman primates experimentally infected with B19V. Serum samples from ten patients and from four cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with B19V followed up for 60 days were used. Most of the human serum samples became negative after pretreatment; however, only decreased viral DNA loads were observed in four patients, indicating that these samples still contained the infectious virus. Reduced B19V DNA levels were observed in animals since 7th dpi. At approximately 45th dpi, B19V DNA levels were below 105 IU/mL after BenzonaseÂ® pretreatment, which was not a consequence of active B19V replication. The test based on BenzonaseÂ® pretreatment enabled the discrimination of ""naked DNA"" from B19V DNA encapsidated in virions. Therefore, this test can be used to clarify the role of B19V as an etiological agent associated with atypical clinical manifestations.",-1
Fabrication of Skin-Mountable Flexible Sensor Patch for Monitoring of Swallowing Function,"Swallowing is a critical function that enables humans to sustain life. When swallowing is compromised, the consequences can be devastating and include malnutrition, dehydration, respiratory compromise, and even death. Swallowing disorders (i.e., dysphagia) are very common in many disorders and diseases, such as stroke, ALS, Parkinson disease, and more, and in fact millions of people across the world are diagnosed with oropharyngeal swallowing disorders every year. Current rehabilitative interventions for dysphagia can be effective, but require daily performance of swallowing exercises that primarily rely on expensive biofeedback devices (e.g., oral manometers, electromyographic (EMG) devices, and endoscopic devices). These types of devices are often only available in medical facilities. However, it is not feasible or economically viable for patients to make multiple visits per day or week to a clinic to receive intensive treatment, especially given mobility limitations that many affected patients often experience. This can reduce treatment adherence and result in decreased rehabilitation potential, re-hospitalizations, and increased healthcare costs. To address this gap, we designed a novel specialized portable skin-mounted flexible sensor system that allows remote signal acquisition of swallowing-related signals. Herein, we report technical details for the fabrication of the skin-mounted flexible sensor patch that is tailored for the human submental (under the chin) area, enabling the continuous, reliable monitoring of both muscles' activity (i.e., EMG signals) and laryngeal movements during swallowing events. The sensor patch is wired to a portable reusable wireless (Bluetooth) unit compatible with smart watches, phones, and tablets for post-data analysis and reporting through a cloud server, which would potentially enable telemonitoring of patients with dysphagia.",-1
Anthropometry did not approach adequate predictive accuracies for detecting elevated fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1c levels among Chinese children aged 7-9 years,"Aims/introduction:                    Elevated concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are well-established independent risk factors for progression to diabetes, cardiovascular comorbidities and mortality. Most previous studies on the relationships of anthropometric measures with hyperglycemia were carried out among adults and adolescents, but few data are available for the performance predication of the predictors for diagnosing elevated FPG or HbA1c among young children.              Materials and methods:                    Involving 5,556 students of aged 7-9 years, a school-based cross-sectional survey was carried out between March and June 2019 in Shenzhen, China. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was utilized.              Results:                    The median was 4.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.3-4.8) mmol/L for FPG and 5.3% (IQR 5.1-5.5%) for HbA1c levels for all participants. For detecting elevated FPG, weight (0.651, IQR 0.583-0.719) and waist circumference (0.650, IQR 0.584-0.717) showed the highest area under the curve and 95% confidence interval, followed by body mass index and the z-score of body mass index (both 0.635, IQR 0.567-0.703); other anthropometric measures showed poorer diagnostic efficiencies or no ability. For detecting elevated HbA1c, lower efficiencies for the Conicity Index (0.651, IQR 0.583-0.719), waist-to-height ratio, waist-to-hip ratio and waist-to-chest ratio were shown. The correlations of FPG and HbA1c levels with anthropometric indices were weak (Spearman's r â?0.179).              Conclusions:                    None of the evaluated anthropometric indicators approached an adequate predictive accuracy for the detection of elevated FPG or HbA1c levels in Shenzhen children aged 7-9 years. The current study did not recommend anthropometry screening for prediabetes in young children.",-1
Learning about mental healthcare in today's Cuba: An interview with the president of the Cuban society of psychology,Purpose:                    Little is known about Cuba's mental healthcare system. We present background information and an interview with the President of the Cuban Society of Psychology to learn about current mental healthcare in today's Cuba.              Conclusions:                    Mental and medical healthcare are free and fully integrated. Early diagnosis and intervention is standard as each patient is known by their community doctor/nurse team from infancy through old age and by yearly home visits.              Practice implications:                    Free and integrated medical and mental healthcare facilitates early detection and intervention. Individuals in Cuba are assisted in maintaining job and schooling during treatment. Therapy is multimodal and eclectic.,-1
From the intestinal mucosal barrier to the enteric neuromuscular compartment: an integrated overview on the morphological changes in Parkinson's disease,"Gastrointestinal dysfunctions represent the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Of note, changes in gut microbiota, impairments of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB), bowel inflammation and neuroplastic rearrangements of the enteric nervous system (ENS) could be involved in the pathophysiology of the intestinal disturbances in PD. In this context, although several review articles have pooled together evidence on the alterations of enteric bacteria-neuro-immune network in PD, a revision of the literature on the specific morphological changes occurring in the intestinal mucosal barrier, the ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD, is lacking. The present review provides a complete appraisal of the available knowledge on the morphological alterations of intestinal mucosal barrier, with particular focus on IEB, ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD. In particular, our intent was to critically discuss whether, based on evidence from translational studies and pre-clinical models, morphological changes in the intestinal barrier and enteric neuromuscular compartment contribute to the pathophysiology of intestinal dysfunctions occurring in PD.",-1
The Antagonist Effect of Arachidonic Acid on GLUT4 Gene Expression by Nuclear Receptor Type II Regulation,"Objectives:                    Obesity is a complex disease that has a strong association with diet and lifestyle. Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty acid (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose metabolism.              Design and methods:                    Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-Î±) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid (LA), and arachidonic acid (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-Î³2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.              Results:                    Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-Î± in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-Î³2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.              Conclusions:                    Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-Î± and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-Î³2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.",-1
Regulating the Imbalance of Gut Microbiota by Smilax china L. Polyphenols to Alleviate Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,"Smilax china L. is used not only as a kind of traditional Chinese herbal medicinal ingredients with various pharmacological properties, but also as food in certain parts of China. However, it is by far still unclear whether Smilax china L. polyphenols (SCP), as important bioactive constituents in Smilax china L., have effects on inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). This study investigated the impact of SCP on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD and gut microbiota in mice. SCP treatments ameliorated typical symptoms of IBD as what was reflected through suppressing body weight loss, colonic shortening, intestinal barrier damage, and increasing intestinal disease activity index. SCP treatments simultaneously decreased the release of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, as well as promoted the release of anti-inflammatory factors. Furthermore, SCP ameliorated the ecological imbalance of gut microbiota and regulated the key bacteria associated with IBD (including Akkermansiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Muribaculaceae, and Anaeroplasmataceae). In general, SCP may improve DSS-induced IBD in mice by regulating inflammatory factors, inhibiting oxidative stress, reducing intestinal tissue damage, and regulating the ecological imbalance of intestinal microbiota. Thus, SCP might serve as a potential therapeutic agent against the inflammation-driven diseases.",-1
Abdominal Fat SIRT6 Expression and Its Relationship with Inflammatory and Metabolic Pathways in Pre-Diabetic Overweight Patients,": The role of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) in adipose abdominal tissue of pre-diabetic (pre-DM) patients is poorly known. Here, we evaluated SIRT6 expression in visceral abdominal fat of obese pre-diabetic patients and the potential effects of metformin therapy. Results indicated that obese pre-DM subjects showed low SIRT6 protein expression and high expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³), and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP-1). Obese pre-DM patients showed high values of glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), C reactive protein (CRP), nitrotyrosine, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and low values of insulin (p < 0.05). Of note, abdominal fat tissue of obese pre-DM patients treated with metformin therapy presented higher SIRT6 expression and lower NF-ÎºB, PPAR-Î³, and SREBP-1 expression levels compared to pre-DM control group. Collectively, results show that SIRT6 is involved in the inflammatory pathway of subcutaneous abdominal fat of obese pre-DM patients and its expression responds to metformin therapy.",-1
"Relationships between computed tomography-assessed density, abdominal fat volume, and glucose metabolism after sleeve gastrectomy in Japanese patients with obesity","In this study, we investigated the relationships between body weight (BW), computed tomography (CT)-assessed abdominal adipose tissue, and the glycemic metabolic profile in obese Japanese patients following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). This study analyzed adipose tissue compartments using CT methods before and 1 year after LSG. Thirty obese patients were studied, and variables measured included visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), density of VAT (VAT-D), and density of SAT (SAT-D). We also examined the parameters in patients according to whether they had type-2 diabetes (T2DM). LSG induced significant losses in BW, SAT, and VAT after LSG. Additionally, SAT-D and VAT-D both increased and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c, but not C-peptide, decreased after surgery. ÎSAT and ÎVAT were positively related, and ÎSAT-D and ÎVAT-D were negatively related to ÎBW and/or FPG. Furthermore, a multivariate regression model showed that total BW loss (TBWL) was closely related to ÎSAT (Î² = 0.84; p < 0.001) and ÎVAT-D (Î² = -0.45; p < 0.05) and improvement of FPG was related to ÎVAT (Î² = 0.61; p < 0.05) after LSG. Finally, ÎFPG was correlated with ÎVAT in 16 T2DM patients (r = 0.58; p < 0.05) but not in non-T2DM patients. TBWL was related to ÎSAT and ÎVAT-D, and improvement of FPG was related to ÎVAT in obese Japanese patients after LSG.",-1
The type of blood used to feed Aedes aegypti females affects their cuticular and internal free fatty acid (FFA) profiles,"Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of various arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) diseases such as dengue and Zika, is a popular laboratory model in vector biology. However, its maintenance in laboratory conditions is difficult, mostly because the females require blood meals to complete oogenesis, which is often provided as sheep blood. The outermost layer of the mosquito cuticle is consists of lipids which protects against numerous entomopathogens, prevents desiccation and plays an essential role in signalling processes. The aim of this work was to determine how the replacement of human blood with sheep blood affects the cuticular and internal FFA profiles of mosquitoes reared in laboratory culture. The individual FFAs present in cuticular and internal extracts from mosquito were identified and quantified by GC-MS method. The normality of their distribution was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Student's t-test was used to compare them. GC-MS analysis revealed similar numbers of internal and cuticular FFAs in the female mosquitoes fed sheep blood by membrane (MFSB) and naturally fed human blood (NFHB), however MFSB group demonstrated 3.1 times greater FFA concentrations in the cuticular fraction and 1.4 times the internal fraction than the NFHB group. In the MFSB group, FFA concentration was 1.6 times higher in the cuticular than the internal fraction, while for NFHB, FFA concentration was 1.3 times lower in the cuticular than the internal fraction. The concentration of C18:3 acid was 223 times higher in the internal fraction than the cuticle in the MHSB group but was absent in the NFHB group. MFSB mosquito demonstrate different FFA profiles to wild mosquitoes, which might influence their fertility and the results of vital processes studied under laboratory conditions. The membrane method of feeding mosquitoes is popular, but our research indicates significant differences in the FFA profiles of MFSB and NFHB. Such changes in FFA profile might influence female fertility, as well as other vital processes studied in laboratory conditions, such as the response to pesticides. Our work indicates that sheep blood has potential shortcomings as a substitute feed for human blood, as its use in laboratory studies may yield different results to those demonstrated by free-living mosquitoes.",-1
[Research in evaluation and intervention of cardiovascular complications of patients with type 1 diabetes on demand],"Recently, great progress has been made in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), however the disease still significantly shortens the life expectancy. Cardiovascular complication is the main cause of death in T1DM patients, and the morbidity is even higher than that of type 2 diabetes. The risk factors of cardiovascular complication in T1DM are different from those of type 2 diabetes. Besides hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, microvascular complications and unhealthy lifestyle, non-traditional risk factors also play very important roles in developing cardiovascular complication, such as hypoglycemia, blood glucose variability, insulin resistance, and autoimmune inflammation of heart. At present, there is a lack of risk assessment and prevention measures for cardiovascular complications in T1DM. It is necessary for more studies to explore whether sodium-dependent glucose transporters 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus, can be equally effective in T1DM.",-1
"LncRNA SENCR overexpression attenuated the proliferation, migration and phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells in aortic dissection via the miR-206/myocardin axis","Background and aims:                    Smooth muscle and endothelial cell-enriched migration/differentiation-associated lncRNA (SENCR) has been reported to be associated with some cardiovascular diseases; however, its function and exact molecular mechanism in aortic dissection (AD) remain undefined. Thus, we investigated the effects of SENCR on AD and its potential mechanisms.              Methods and results:                    SENCR expression in aortic media specimens from AD patients was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The roles of SENCR in vascular smooth muscle cell (VMSC) proliferation and migration as well as in the regulation of contractile phenotype genes were studied using CCK-8, wound healing, Transwell, qPCR and Western blot assays. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to identify the regulatory correlation between SENCR, miR-206 and myocardin. Furthermore, mouse AD models were constructed with ApoE-/- mice, and the effect of upregulated SENCR on phenotypic switching in the AD model was detected using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. SENCR overexpression inhibited VSMC proliferation, migration and synthetic phenotype-related gene expression; decreased miR-206 expression; increased myocardin expression; and suppressed rupture of the aortic media in mice. SENCR knockdown had the opposite effects. Our results further suggested that miR-206 upregulation could reverse the inhibitory roles of SENCR upregulation and that myocardin upregulation could restore the function of SENCR upregulation in VSMCs. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that SENCR regulated miR-206, which directly targeted myocardin in VSMCs.              Conclusion:                    SENCR overexpression suppressed VMSC proliferation and migration, maintained the contractile phenotype and suppressed aortic dilatation via the miR-206/myocardin axis.",-1
"Elevated ATP via enhanced miRNA-30b, 30c, and 30e downregulates the expression of CD73 in CD8+ T cells of HIV-infected individuals","CD8+ T cells play a crucial role against chronic viral infections, however, their effector functions are influenced by the expression of co-stimulatory/inhibitory receptors. For example, CD73 works with CD39 to convert highly inflammatory ATP to adenosine. However, its expression on T cells in the context of viral infections has not been well defined. Here, we analyzed the expression of CD73 on human T cells in a cohort of 102 HIV-infected individuals including those on antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART-naÃ¯ve, and long-term non-progressors who were not on ART. We found that the frequency of CD73+ T cells was markedly lower among T cell subsets (e.g. naÃ¯ve, effector or memory) in the peripheral blood of all HIV-infected individuals. Notably, CD73 was decreased at the cell surface, intracellular and gene levels. Functionally, CD8+CD73+ T cells exhibited decreased cytokine expression (TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³ and IL-2) upon global or antigen-specific stimulation and impaired expression of cytolytic molecules at the gene and protein levels. In contrast, CD8+CD73+ T cells expressed elevated levels of homing receptors such as CCR7, Î±4Î²7 integrin, which suggests a migratory advantage for these cells as observed in vitro. We also observed significant migration of CD73+CD8+ T cells into the cerebrospinal fluids of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients at the time of disease relapse. Moreover, we found that elevated levels of ATP in the plasma of HIV-infected individuals upregulates the expression of miRNA30b-e in T cells in vitro. In turn, inhibition of miRNAs (30b, 30c and 30e) resulted in significant upregulation of CD73 mRNA in CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we provide a novel mechanism for the downregulation of CD73 via ATP-induced upregulation of miRNA30b, 30c and 30e in HIV infection. Finally, these observations imply that ATP-mediated downregulation of CD73 mainly occurs via its receptor, P2X1/P2RX1. Our results may in part explain why HIV-infected individuals have reduced risk of developing MS considering the role of CD73 for efficient T cell entry into the central nervous system.",-1
Prolonged fasting induces long-lasting metabolic consequences in mice,"To endure prolonged fasting, animals undergo important acute physiological adjustments. However, whether severe fasting also leads to long-term metabolic adaptations is largely unknown. Forty-eight-hour fasting caused a pronounced weight loss in adult C57BL/6 male mice. Seven days of refeeding increased body adiposity to levels above baseline, whereas fasting-induced reductions in lean body mass and energy expenditure were not fully recovered. Respiratory exchange ratio and locomotor activity also remained altered. A fasting/refeeding cycle led to persistent suppression of Pomc mRNA levels and significant changes in the expression of histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases in the hypothalamus. Additionally, histone acetylation in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus was reduced by prolonged fasting and remained suppressed after refeeding. Mice subjected to 48-h fasting 30 days earlier exhibited higher body weight and fat mass compared to aged-matched animals that were never food-deprived. Furthermore, a previous fasting experience altered the changes in body weight, lean mass, energy expenditure and locomotor activity induced by a second cycle of fasting and refeeding. Notably, when acutely exposed to high-palatable/high-fat diet, mice that went through cumulative fasting episodes presented higher calorie intake and reduced energy expenditure and fat oxidation, compared to mice that had never been subjected to fasting. When chronically exposed to high-fat diet, mice that experienced cumulative fasting episodes showed higher gain of body and fat mass and reduced energy expenditure and calorie intake. In summary, cumulative episodes of prolonged fasting lead to hypothalamic epigenetic changes and long-lasting metabolic adaptations in mice.",-1
Melatonin Mitigates Oxazolone-Induced Colitis in Microbiota-Dependent Manner,"Levels of type 2 cytokines are elevated in the blood and intestinal tissues of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in the active phase; this phenomenon indicates the participation of type 2 immune response in UC progression. The beneficial effects of melatonin in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis models have been illustrated, but its role in the oxazolone (Oxa)-induced colitis model (driven by type 2 immune response) remains relatively unknown. We investigated the relationship between melatonin concentration and the severity of UC, revealing a significantly negative correlation. Subsequently, we investigated the effects of melatonin in Oxa-induced colitis mice and the potential underlying mechanisms. Administration of melatonin significantly counteracted body weight loss, colon shortening, and neutrophil infiltration in Oxa-induced colitis mice. Melatonin treatment mitigated Oxa-induced colitis by suppressing type 2 immune response. In addition, melatonin attenuated intestinal permeability by enhancing the expression of ZO-1 and occludin in colitis mice. Interestingly, the protective effect of melatonin was abolished when the mice were co-housed, indicating that the regulation of gut microbiota by melatonin was critical in alleviating Oxa-induced colitis. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to explore the microbiota composition. Decreased richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level resulted from melatonin treatment. Melatonin also elevated the abundance of Bifidobacterium, a well-known probiotic, and reduced proportions of several harmful bacterial genera, such as Desulfovibrio, Peptococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to explore the role of microbiota in the function of melatonin in Oxa-induced colitis. Microbiota transplantation from melatonin-treated mice alleviated Oxa-induced colitis, suggesting that the microbiome participates in the relief of Oxa-induced colitis by melatonin. Our findings demonstrate that melatonin ameliorates Oxa-induced colitis in a microbiota-dependent manner, suggesting the therapeutic potential of melatonin in treating type 2 immunity-associated UC.",-1
Effects of Artemisia macrocephala Jacquem on Memory Deficits and Brain Oxidative Stress in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice,"Different species of Artemisia have been reported to have therapeutic potential in treating various health disorders, including diabetes and memory dysfunction. The present study was planned to evaluate the effects of Artemisia macrocephala Jacquem crude extract and its subfractions as antiamnesic agents in streptozotocin-induced (STZ) diabetic mice. The in vivo behavioral studies were performed using the Y Maze test and novel object recognition test (NORT) test at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg of crude extract and 75 and 150 mg/kg of fractions. The in vitro and ex vivo anticholinesterase activities, along with biochemical parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and lipid peroxidation) in the brain, were evaluated. Blood glucose levels were monitored with a glucometer; crude extract and fractions reduced the glucose level considerably, with some differences in the extent of their efficacies. The crude extract and fractions demonstrated significant inhibitory activity against cholinesterases (AChE and BuChE) in vitro. Crude, chloroform and ethyl acetate extract were found to be more potent than the other fractions, with IC50 of Crd-Am = 116.36 Â± 1.48 and 240.52 Â± 1.35 Âµg/mL, Chl-Am = 52.68 Â± 1.09 and 57.45 Â± 1.39 Âµg/mL and Et-Am = 75.19 Â± 1.02 and 116.58 Â± 1.09 Âµg/mL, respectively. Oxidative stress biomarkers like superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione levels were elevated, whereas MDA levels were reduced by crude extract and all fractions with little difference in their respective values. The Y-maze test and novel object recognition test demonstrated declines in memory impairment in groups (n = 6) treated with crude extract and fractions as compared to STZ diabetic (amnesic) group. The most active fraction, Chl-Am, was also subjected to isolation of bioactive compounds; three compounds were obtained in pure state and designated as AB-I, AB-II and AB-III. Overall, the results of the study showed that Artemisia macrocephala Jacquem enhanced the memory impairment associated with diabetes, elevated acetylcholine levels and ameliorated oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to explore the beneficial role of the secondary metabolites isolated in the present study as memory enhancers. Toxicological aspects of the extracts are also important and need to be evaluated in other animal models.",-1
"Associations of dietary energy density with body composition and cardiometabolic risk in children with overweight and obesity: role of energy density calculations, under-reporting energy intake and physical activity","This study examined (1) the association of dietary energy density from solid (EDS) and solid plus liquids (EDSL) with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk factors (CRF) in children with overweight and obesity, (2) the effect of under-reporting on the mentioned associations and (3) whether the association between ED and body composition and CRF is influenced by levels of physical activity. In a cross-sectional design, 208 overweight and obese children (8-12-year-old; 111 boys) completed two non-consecutive 24 h recalls. ED was calculated using two different approaches: EDS and EDSL. Under-reporters were determined with the Goldberg method. Body composition, anthropometry and fasting blood sample measurements were performed. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was registered with accelerometers (7-d-register). Linear regressions were performed to evaluate the association of ED with the previously mentioned variables. Neither EDS nor EDSL were associated with body composition or CRF. However, when under-reporters were excluded, EDS was positively associated with BMI (P=0Â·019), body fat percentage (P=0Â·005), abdominal fat (P=0Â·008) and fat mass index (P=0Â·018), while EDSL was positively associated with body fat percentage (P=0Â·008) and fat mass index (P=0Â·026). When stratifying the group according to physical activity recommendations, the aforementioned associations were only maintained for non-compliers. Cluster analysis showed that the low-ED and high-MVPA group presented the healthiest profile for all adiposity and CRF. These findings could partly explain inconsistencies in literature, as we found that different ED calculations entail distinct results. Physical activity levels and excluding under-reporters greatly influence the associations between ED and adiposity in children with overweight and obesity.",-1
Vitamin D and Ocular Diseases: A Systematic Review,"The contributory roles of vitamin D in ocular and visual health have long been discussed, with numerous studies pointing to the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of recent findings on the association between vitamin D and different ocular diseases, including myopia, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), dry eye syndrome (DES), thyroid eye disease (TED), uveitis, retinoblastoma (RB), cataract, and others, from epidemiological, clinical and basic studies, and briefly discuss vitamin D metabolism in the eye. We searched two research databases for articles examining the association between vitamin D deficiency and different ocular diseases. One hundred and sixty-two studies were found. There is evidence on the association between vitamin D and myopia, AMD, DR, and DES. Overall, 17 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and AMD, while 48 out of 54 studies reported that vitamin D was associated with DR, and 25 out of 27 studies reported an association between vitamin D and DES. However, the available evidence for the association with other ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, TED, and RB, remains limited.",-1

"Two-Hour Post-Load Plasma Glucose, a Biomarker to Improve the GRACE Score in Patients without Known Diabetes","Objective:                    To assess improvement in predictive performance of Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score (GRS) by addition of a glucose matrix.              Methods:                    1,056 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) survivors without known diabetes had pre-discharge fasting (FPG) and 2-h post-load plasma glucose (2h-PG) measured. GRS was calculated. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE; death and non-fatal myocardial infarction) were recorded during follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression predicted event-free survival. Likelihood ratio test, Akaike's information criteria, continuous net reclassification index (NRI>0), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to test the additional prognostic value of glycaemic indices over GRS.              Results:                    During a median follow-up of 36.5 months, 211 MACEs (20.0%), 96 deaths (9.1%), and 115 non-fatal re-infarctions (10.9%), occurred. 2h-PG, but not FPG, independently predicted MACE-free survival at all time points (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13, p = 0.002, at 3 years). Risk of MACE increased by 8-11% with every 1 mmol/L rise in 2h-PG. 2h-PG significantly improved the prognostic models containing GRS. Models containing GRS and 2h-PG yielded lowest corrected Akaike's information criteria compared to that with only GRS. 2h-PG, but not FPG, improved NRI>0 (NRI>0 0.169, p = 0.028 at 3 years) and IDI (IDI of 0.66%, p = 0.018 at 3 years) significantly at all time points during the follow-up.              Conclusions:                    2h-PG, but not FPG, improves performance of GRS-containing models in predicting post-ACS prognosis in the short to medium term.",-1
"Distribution, organization and expression of genes concerned with anaerobic lactate utilization in human intestinal bacteria","Lactate accumulation in the human gut is linked to a range of deleterious health impacts. However, lactate is consumed and converted to the beneficial short-chain fatty acids butyrate and propionate by indigenous lactate-utilizing bacteria. To better understand the underlying genetic basis for lactate utilization, transcriptomic analyses were performed for two prominent lactate-utilizing species from the human gut,  Anaerobutyricum soehngenii  and  Coprococcus catus , during growth on lactate, hexose sugar or hexose plus lactate. In  A. soehngenii  L2-7 six genes of the lactate utilization (lct) cluster, including NAD-independent d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-iLDH), were co-ordinately upregulated during growth on equimolar d- and l-lactate (dl-lactate). Upregulated genes included an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase related to butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which may play a role in transferring reducing equivalents between reduction of crotonyl-CoA and oxidation of lactate. Genes upregulated in  C. catus  GD/7 included a six-gene cluster (lap) encoding propionyl CoA-transferase, a putative lactoyl-CoA epimerase, lactoyl-CoA dehydratase and lactate permease, and two unlinked acyl-CoA dehydrogenase genes that are candidates for acryloyl-CoA reductase. A d-iLDH homologue in  C. catus  is encoded by a separate, partial lct, gene cluster, but not upregulated on lactate. While  C. catus  converts three mols of dl-lactate via the acrylate pathway to two mols propionate and one mol acetate, some of the acetate can be re-used with additional lactate to produce butyrate. A key regulatory difference is that while glucose partially repressed lct cluster expression in  A. soehngenii , there was no repression of lactate-utilization genes by fructose in the non-glucose utilizer  C. catus . This suggests that these species could occupy different ecological niches for lactate utilization in the gut, which may be important factors to consider when developing lactate-utilizing bacteria as novel candidate probiotics.",-1
Ca2+ administration prevents Î±-synuclein proteotoxicity by stimulating calcineurin-dependent lysosomal proteolysis,"The capacity of a cell to maintain proteostasis progressively declines during aging. Virtually all age-associated neurodegenerative disorders associated with aggregation of neurotoxic proteins are linked to defects in the cellular proteostasis network, including insufficient lysosomal hydrolysis. Here, we report that proteotoxicity in yeast and Drosophila models for Parkinson's disease can be prevented by increasing the bioavailability of Ca2+, which adjusts intracellular Ca2+ handling and boosts lysosomal proteolysis. Heterologous expression of human Î±-synuclein (Î±Syn), a protein critically linked to Parkinson's disease, selectively increases total cellular Ca2+ content, while the levels of manganese and iron remain unchanged. Disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis results in inhibition of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D and triggers premature cellular and organismal death. External administration of Ca2+ reduces Î±Syn oligomerization, stimulates cathepsin D activity and in consequence restores survival, which critically depends on the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. In flies, increasing the availability of Ca2+ discloses a neuroprotective role of Î±Syn upon manganese overload. In sum, we establish a molecular interplay between cathepsin D and calcineurin that can be activated by Ca2+ administration to counteract Î±Syn proteotoxicity.",-1
Common variant rs6564851 near the beta-carotene oxygenase 1 gene is associated with plasma triglycerides levels in middle-aged Mexican men adults,"Dyslipidemias have been linked to an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. Recent reports have associated the beta-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) gene with lipid metabolism, mainly reducing total cholesterol and increasing high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. The hypothesis of this study was that the variant rs6564851 near the BCO1 gene is associated positively with the lipid profile in middle-aged Mexican adults. This study included 1441 Mexicans older than 40 years of age from the Health Workers Cohort Study (HWCS). Genotyping was conducted using a predesigned TaqMan assay. Lipid profile was measured with standardized procedures. Our results showed that the men carrying at least 1 T allele had higher serum triglyceride concentrations than GG homozygous (GG: 146.5 mg/dL; GT: 175 mg/dL; and TT: 184 mg/dL; P = .008). The variant rs6564851 showed a risk associated with the serum triglyceride concentrations(odds ratio [OR], 2.77; P = .002) only in the male group. However, we did not observe significant differences in the serum total cholesterol, HDL-C, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations in both sexes. Our study provides evidence that the variant rs6564851 is negatively associated with the triglyceride concentrations in middle-aged Mexican male adults in the HWCS. This knowledge can be the basis for developing effective nutritional strategies according to sex and the genetic variants present in an individual. Further studies in independent populations are required to validate these findings and determine the mechanism of the association sex dependent.",-1
Toward a principled Bayesian workflow in cognitive science,"Experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas of cognitive science are increasingly being analyzed using Bayesian methods. This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. The utility of Bayesian methods, however, ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst's domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To demonstrate this point, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative clause sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.

Riboflavin instability is a key factor underlying the requirement of a gut microbiota for mosquito development,"We previously determined that several diets used to rear Aedes aegypti and other mosquito species support the development of larvae with a gut microbiota but do not support the development of axenic larvae. In contrast, axenic larvae have been shown to develop when fed other diets. To understand the mechanisms underlying this dichotomy, we developed a defined diet that could be manipulated in concert with microbiota composition and environmental conditions. Initial studies showed that axenic larvae could not grow under standard rearing conditions (27 Â°C, 16-h light: 8-h dark photoperiod) when fed a defined diet but could develop when maintained in darkness. Downstream assays identified riboflavin decay to lumichrome as the key factor that prevented axenic larvae from growing under standard conditions, while gut community members like Escherichia coli rescued development by being able to synthesize riboflavin. Earlier results showed that conventional and gnotobiotic but not axenic larvae exhibit midgut hypoxia under standard rearing conditions, which correlated with activation of several pathways with essential growth functions. In this study, axenic larvae in darkness also exhibited midgut hypoxia and activation of growth signaling but rapidly shifted to midgut normoxia and arrested growth in light, which indicated that gut hypoxia was not due to aerobic respiration by the gut microbiota but did depend on riboflavin that only resident microbes could provide under standard conditions. Overall, our results identify riboflavin provisioning as an essential function for the gut microbiota under most conditions A. aegypti larvae experience in the laboratory and field.",-1
[Effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on type 1 diabetes mellitus in non-obese diabetic mice and its underlying mechanism],"Objective: To investigate the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: A total of 8-9 week-female NOD mice were randomly divided into control (n=36) and FMT groups (n=36) according to the random number table. Fecal microbiota from C57BL/6 mice were transplanted into FMT group, and control group were transplanted with microbiota from themselves, once every two days for 5 times. The insulitis score and incidence of T1DM were compared between two groups;16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to evaluate the structure of fecal bacteria in NOD mice. The expressions of intestinal barrier related genes were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The proportions of regulatory T cells (Tregs), helper T cell (Th)-1 and Th17 in the enteric-pancreatic immune axis were detected by flow cytometry. Amino acid in serum was measured by amino acid metabolomics. Results: Incidence of T1DM in NOD mice from FMT group was 40.9% (9/22), lower than 72.7% (13/22) from control group at 26 weeks of age (P=0.034). FMT promoted colonization of probiotics such as Lactobacillus, Clostridium_sp_ND2, Candidatus_Arthromitus and Clostridiaceae_1; mRNA of intestinal barrier related genes were up-regulated in FMT group [ mucins(Muc)-1: 0.93Â±0.29 vs 2.97Â±0.79, P=0.036; Muc2: 0.72Â±0.39 vs 10.70Â±3.54, P=0.019;Muc3: 1.79Â±0.69 vs 10.97Â±2.78, P=0.009;Muc4: 1.01Â±0.23 vs 2.42Â±0.49, P=0.029;Occludin(Ocln): 0.96Â±0.08 vs 1.81Â±0.36, P=0.045; Claudin(Cldn)-1:0.94Â±0.17 vs 2.20Â±0.43, P=0.022] compared to control. The proportions of Treg in mesenteric lymphoid node, pancreatic lymph node and peyer's patches of FMT group [(6.10Â±0.49)% vs (7.54Â±0.27)%, P=0.020;(5.28Â±0.39)% vs (6.42Â±0.34)%, P=0.048;(6.78Â±0.42)% vs (7.88Â±0.13)%, P=0.029] were increased compared to control,while proportions of Th1 [(1.02Â±0.06)% vs (0.83Â±0.06)%, P=0.040;(0.82Â±0.10)% vs (0.56Â±0.05)%, P=0.038;(1.28Â±0.12) vs (0.85Â±0.07), P=0.012] and proportions of Th17 [(0.40Â±0.01)% vs (0.30Â±0.02)%, P=0.004;(0.40Â±0.02)% vs (0.31Â±0.02)%, P=0.008;(0.51Â±0.06) vs (0.36Â±0.02), P=0.027] were decreased. The contents of leucine [(92.86Â±7.32) vs (91.87Â±12.62) Î¼mol/L, P=0.027], valine [(162.74Â±15.97) vs (155.89Â±25.70) Î¼mol/L, P=0.046] and isoleucine [(75.65Â±5.59) vs (73.61Â±9.67) Î¼mol/L, P=0.048] in serum were decreased in FMT group. Conclusions: FMT can alleviate insulitis and T1DM occurrence in NOD mice, of which mechanism may be related to remodeling gut microbiota and improving intestinal barrier function, affecting immune response of enteric-pancreatic immune axis, correcting amino acid metabolism disorder and reducing the accumulation of branch chain amino acids in NOD mice.",-1
Roles of miR-124-3p/Scd1 in urolithin A-induced brown adipocyte differentiation and succinate-dependent regulation of mitochondrial complex II,"Brown adipocytes have been linked to managing human obesity and related metabolic diseases. A large number of natural products have emerged that can activate brown adipocytes tissue (BAT) to active thermogenesis, but the epigenetic mechanisms have not been fully resolved. In this study, we identified the induction of miR-124-3p by urolithin A (UA) as a means to increase the thermogenic activity of brown adipocytes. Overexpression of miR-124-3p enhances thermogenesis by increasing mitochondrial content in brown adipocytes. Mechanistically, to clarify that miR-124-3p affects fatty acid synthesis using bioinformatics methods, it is clear that miR-124 affects the synthesis of fatty acids through the enrichment analysis of the KEGG pathway, and using dual luci. ferase to determine the target gene as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) while controlling rates of fatty acids synthesis and de novo brown fat biogenesis. Finally, in the overexpression of miR-124-3p and UA-treated BAT, succinate accumulation was enhanced in cells and fueled mitochondrial complex II activities. This study highlights a miR-124-3p/SCD1/succinate pathway that stimulates thermogenesis of BAT via the modulatory roles of UA.",-1
Dysregulated lipid metabolism in colorectal cancer,"Purpose of review:                    Lipid metabolism presents a targetable metabolic vulnerability in colorectal cancer (CRC). Lipid signatures and cancer-cell lipid requirements may serve as noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and as a therapeutic target, respectively.              Recent findings:                    A growing body of new studies highlight the complexity of lipid metabolism in CRC. Cancer cells are able to utilize an alternative fatty acid desaturation pathway, underlining the metabolic plasticity of tumors. CRC tissue shows a robust triglyceride-species signature with prognostic value in CRC patients. Lipidomic analyses in germfree and colonized mice identify a unique lipid signature and suggest that bacteria inhibit metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids by blocking desaturase and elongase activities. Cellular stress responses, particularly the well characterized unfolded protein response, are involved in regulating lipid synthesis and homeostasis, and contribute to adaptation of the lipid environment. Together, lipid metabolism, the intestinal microbiota and cellular stress responses unarguably play crucial roles in CRC.              Summary:                    A number of recent advances in our understanding of dysregulated lipid metabolism in CRC underline the importance of this research field. An improved knowledge of the complex interplay between lipid metabolism, cellular stress and the intestinal microbiota in the context of CRC may lead to novel therapeutic strategies.",-1
Image Fusion and Stylization Processing Based on Multiscale Transformation and Convolutional Neural Network,"With the continuous development of imaging sensors, images contain more and more information, the images presented by different types of sensors are different, and the images obtained by the same type of sensors under different parameters or conditions are also different. Multisource image fusion technology combines images acquired by different types of sensors or the same type of sensors with different parameter settings, which makes the image information more complete, compensates for the limitations of images of the same type, and also allows you to save information about the characteristics of the original image. Multimodal image mosaic and multifocal image mosaic have been studied in detail in two directions. On the one hand, a method based on frequency domain transformation is used for multiscale image decomposition. On the other hand, image extraction with neural network-based methods is proposed. The technology of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) allows to extract richer texture features. However, when using this method for fusion, it is difficult to obtain an accurate decision map, and there are artifacts in the fusion boundary. Based on this, a multifocal fusion method based on a two-stage CNN is proposed. Train the advanced intensive network to classify input image blocks as focus, and then use the appropriate merge rules to get the ideal decision tree. In addition, several versions of the fuzzy learning set have been developed to improve network performance. Experimental results show that the frames of the first stage proposed by the algorithm make it possible to obtain an accurate decision scheme and that the frames of the second stage make it possible to eliminate the pseudo-shadow of the integration boundary.",-1
The influence of antioxidant dietary-derived polyphenolic combination on breast cancer: Molecular study,"Breast cancer remains a leading cause of female mortality worldwide. Therefore, novel complementary treatments have been sought. Recently, there has been a growing interest in investigating the possible complementary effects of polyphenolic compounds against various malignancies. In the present study, using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, the anticancer efficacy of a polyphenolic mixture (PFM) was investigated. PFM is composed of curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate, and quercetin. PFM treatment led to a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, with IC50 values of 25.9 Â± 3 Âµg/ml and 29.4 Â± 0.9 Âµg/ml for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. In addition, PFM induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells and cell cycle arrest at the S phase in MCF-7 cells. Using RT-qPCR, PFM treatment was observed to result in significant downregulation of the oncogenic miR-155 (P < 0.05), as well as significant downregulation of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, hexokinase 2 (HK2) (P < 0.05), while upregulating the expression of the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene (P < 0.01). PFM was also found to exert an anti-migration effect in breast cancer cells using the wound healing assay, as well as significantly (P < 0.05) increasing the median survival of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that PFM possesses potential antitumor effects against breast cancer. A possible mechanism of action could be due to PFM's effect in modulating the expression of the glycolytic enzyme HK2 through suppression of miR-155 in MCF-7 cells. Combining polyphenolic compounds that interact with one another could result in synergistic effects that potentially target various tumour hallmarks.",-1
Paternal and maternal effects in a mosquito: A bridge for life history transition,"Parental (transgenerational) effects occur when the conditions experienced by a mother or father contribute to offspring phenotype. Here we show that parental larval diet in mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, results in differential allocation of resources in offspring of parents depending on the nutritional condition (quality) of their mate. Maternal effects influenced the number of eggs produced by females as well as their lipid investment. Low nutrient females mated with high nutrient males laid eggs with significantly higher lipid content than those laid by high nutrient females. Paternal effects showed that when high nutrient males mated with low nutrient females, resulting eggs had higher lipid content than when low nutrient males mated with low nutrient females. Overall, our results are consistent with a pattern predicted by the differential allocation of resources hypothesis, when females experience nutritional deprivation, which asserts that mate quality directly influences reproductive allocation.",-1
Assessing the suitability for Aedes albopictus and dengue transmission risk in China with a delay differential equation model,"Dengue is considered non-endemic to mainland China. However, travellers frequently import the virus from overseas and local mosquito species can then spread the disease in the population. As a consequence, mainland China still experiences large dengue outbreaks. Temperature plays a key role in these outbreaks: it affects the development and survival of the vector and the replication rate of the virus. To better understand its implication in the transmission risk of dengue, we developed a delay differential equation model that explicitly simulates temperature-dependent development periods and tested it with collected field data for the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. The model predicts mosquito occurrence locations with a high accuracy (Cohen's Îº of 0.78) and realistically replicates mosquito population dynamics. Analysing the infection dynamics during the 2014 dengue outbreak that occurred in Guangzhou showed that the outbreak could have lasted for another four weeks if mosquito control interventions had not been undertaken. Finally, we analyse the dengue transmission risk in mainland China. We find that southern China, including Guangzhou, can have more than seven months of dengue transmission per year while even Beijing, in the temperate north, can have dengue transmission during hot summer months. The results demonstrate the importance of using detailed vector and infection ecology, especially when vector-borne disease transmission risk is modelled over a broad range of climatic zones.",-1
ALCAM/CD166 Is Involved in the Binding and Uptake of Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) and ovarian cancer (OvC) patients frequently develop peritoneal metastasis, a condition associated with a very poor prognosis. In these cancers, tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) cause immunosuppression, facilitate the direct attachment and invasion of cancer cells through the mesothelium, induce the conversion of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and transfer a more aggressive phenotype amongst cancer cells. Although the promoting role of EVs in CRC and OvC peritoneal metastasis is well established, the specific molecules that mediate the interactions between tumor-derived EVs and immune and non-immune target cells remain elusive. Here, we employed the SKOV-3 (ovarian adenocarcinoma) and Colo-320 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) human cell lines as model systems to study the interactions and uptake of EVs produced by ovarian carcinoma and colorectal carcinoma cells, respectively. We established that the adhesion molecule ALCAM/CD166 is involved in the interaction of cancer-derived EVs with recipient cancer cells (a process termed ""EV binding"" or ""EV docking"") and in their subsequent uptake by these cells. The identification of ALCAM/CD166 as a molecule mediating the docking and uptake of CRC and OvC-derived EVs may be potentially exploited to block the peritoneal metastasis cascade promoted by EVs in CRC and OvC patients.",-1
Impact of Î±-synuclein spreading on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway depends on the onset of the pathology,"Misfolded Î±-synuclein spreads along anatomically connected areas through the brain, prompting progressive neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway in Parkinson's disease. To investigate the impact of early stage seeding and spreading of misfolded Î±-synuclein along with the nigrostriatal pathway, we studied the pathophysiologic effect induced by a single acute Î±-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) inoculation into the midbrain. Further, to model the progressive vulnerability that characterizes the dopamine (DA) neuron life span, we used two cohorts of mice with different ages: 2-month-old (young) and 5-month-old (adult) mice. Two months after Î±-synuclein PFFs injection, we found that striatal DA release decreased exclusively in adult mice. Adult DA neurons showed an increased level of pathology spreading along with the nigrostriatal pathway accompanied with a lower volume of Î±-synuclein deposition in the midbrain, impaired neurotransmission, rigid DA terminal composition, and less microglial reactivity compared with young neurons. Notably, preserved DA release and increased microglial coverage in the PFFs-seeded hemisphere coexist with decreased large-sized terminal density in young DA neurons. This suggests the presence of a targeted pruning mechanism that limits the detrimental effect of Î±-synuclein early spreading. This study suggests that the impact of the pathophysiology caused by misfolded Î±-synuclein spreading along the nigrostriatal pathway depends on the age of the DA network, reducing striatal DA release specifically in adult mice.",-1
"Associations among prenatal PM 2.5, birth weight, and renal function","Background:                    Low birth weight has long-term health effects, including neurodevelopmental delays, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes, through epigenetic changes and modifications. Numerous studies have identified that PM2.5 is associated with low birth weight. However, the association between PM2.5 and renal function, as well as the mediated effect of renal function on the association between prenatal PM2.5 and birth weight are still under-recognized.              Methods:                    A total of 8969 singleton live births born in 2015-2019 were included in this study. The inverse distance weighting method was applied to interpolate and calculate the average exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy for each pregnant woman. The multiple linear regression model was used to shed light on the associations among prenatal PM2.5, birth weight, and renal function. In addition, the mediation analysis was performed to figure out the mediated effect of renal function on the association between prenatal PM2.5 and birth weight, and the proportion of mediated effect = (indirect effect/total effect) Ã 100%.              Results:                    Per 10 Î¼g/m3 increment of prenatal PM2.5 was associated with 8.98 g (95% CI: -16.94 to -1.02) decrease of birth weight, 0.49 (95% CI: -0.73 to -0.26) ml/min/1.73 m2 decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01-0.05) mmol/L increase of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and 2.29 (95% CI: 0.86-3.72) Î¼mol/L increase of uric acid (UA) after adjusting for the sociodemographic covariates, disease-related covariates and meteorological factors. Besides, the mediated effects of GFR and BUN on the association between prenatal PM2.5 and birth weight were 5.02% and 14.96%, but there was no significant mediated effect being identified in UA.              Conclusion:                    Prenatal PM2.5 is related to reduced birth weight and impaired renal function. Renal function plays a partial role in the association between prenatal PM2.5 and birth weight. Appropriate guidelines should be formulated by the concerned authorities, and adequate efforts should be made to mitigate the detrimental health effects of PM2.5.",-1
Potential health effects of brewers' spent grain as a functional food ingredient assessed by markers of oxidative stress and inflammation following gastro-intestinal digestion and in a cell model of the small intestine,"Brewer's spent grains (BSG) are a by-product of the beer-brewing industry, often employed as animal feeding stuffs. With BSG being rich not only in proteins, lipids, and dietary fiber but also in certain phytochemicals, it constitutes a potentially valuable food source that could be employed as a functional food, e.g. against chronic inflammatory diseases. Several types of bread were prepared with various amounts of BSG as flour replacement (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%), either employing wet BSG or dried BSG after pressing. Total phenolics, flavonoids, insoluble dietary fiber, as well as antioxidant capacity (FRAP, ABTS) were measured in the bread, before and after simulated gastro-intestinal digestion. Furthermore, we investigated digested BSG and bread-containing BSG for their capability to alter oxidative stress (Nrf2, malondialdehyde) and inflammation (IL-6, IL-8, NO, and PGE2) in a Caco-2 cell culture model of the small intestine. Incorporation of BSG significantly and dose-dependently enhanced the amount of dietary fiber in the product, as well as total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity, by over 10-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold and 5-fold, respectively, when replacing all of the flour with BSG. This pattern remained after in vitro digestion. However, digesta failed to show significant antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects on the biomarkers observed in the cell model. Consuming 150 g of such a BSG-bread (wet based) would supply the proposed RDA of 25 g d-1 dietary fiber and could be a healthy product valorizing BSG.",-1
Instantaneous Brain Strain Estimation for Automotive Head Impacts via Deep Learning,"Efficient brain strain estimation is critical for routine application of a head injury model. Lately, a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully developed to estimate spatially detailed brain strains instantly and accurately in contact sports. Here, we extend its application to automotive head impacts, where impact profiles are typically more complex with longer durations. Head impact kinematics (N=458) from two public databases were used to generate augmented impacts (N=2694). They were simulated using the anisotropic Worcester Head Injury Model (WHIM) V1.0, which provided baseline elementwise peak maximum principal strain (MPS). For each augmented impact, rotational velocity (vrot) and the corresponding rotational acceleration (arot) profiles were concatenated as static images to serve as CNN input. Three training strategies were evaluated: 1) ""baseline"", using random initial weights; 2) ""transfer learning"", using weight transfer from a previous CNN model trained on head impacts drawn from contact sports; and 3) ""combined training"", combining previous training data from contact sports (N=5661) for training. The combined training achieved the best performances. For peak MPS, the CNN achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.932 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.031 for the real-world testing dataset. It also achieved a success rate of 60.5% and 94.8% for elementwise MPS, where the linear regression slope, k, and correlation coefficient, r, between estimated and simulated MPS did not deviate from 1.0 (when identical) by more than 0.1 and 0.2, respectively. Cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM) from the CNN estimation was also highly accurate compared to those from direct simulation across a range of thresholds (R2 of 0.899-0.943 with RMSE of 0.054-0.069). Finally, the CNN achieved an average k and r of 0.98Â±0.12 and 0.90Â±0.07, respectively, for six reconstructed car crash impacts drawn from two other sources independent of the training dataset. Importantly, the CNN is able to efficiently estimate elementwise MPS with sufficient accuracy while conventional kinematic injury metrics cannot. Therefore, the CNN has the potential to supersede current kinematic injury metrics that can only approximate a global peak MPS or CSDM. The CNN technique developed here may offer enhanced utility in the design and development of head protective countermeasures, including in the automotive industry. This is the first study aimed at instantly estimating spatially detailed brain strains for automotive head impacts, which employs >8.8 thousand impact simulations generated from ~1.5 years of nonstop computations on a high-performance computing platform.",-1
Predictive Coding Approximates Backprop Along Arbitrary Computation Graphs,"Backpropagation of error (backprop) is a powerful algorithm for training machine learning architectures through end-to-end differentiation. Recently it has been shown that backprop in multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically plausible process theory of cortical computation that relies solely on local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs but in the concept of automatic differentiation, which allows for the optimization of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice, rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and the more complex long short-term memory, which include a nonlayer-like branching internal graph structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks while using only local and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in neural circuitry and may also contribute to the development of completely distributed neuromorphic architectures.",-1
Ketosis in patients undergoing medically supervised therapeutic fasting-results from an observational trial,"Background/aim:                    Medically supervised fasting has long tradition and broad acceptance in some European countries. The exact amount to which ketone bodies are produced as well as their possible contribution to beneficial effects in this procedure are open.              Methods:                    Open-label observational trial with in-patients undergoing medically supervised fasting with supplementation of approximately 40 g/d carbohydrates as part of an established routine care. Daily finger-stick blood samples for measurement of glucose and Ã-hydroxybutyrate. Descriptive analysis for all data.              Results:                    Complete sets of data of 17 patients (5 m, mean age 63.1) could be evaluated. Mean concentrations of Ã-hydroxybutyrate rose continuously to a mean maximum of 3.6 mmol/L with an individual maximum of 5.1 mmol/L, while glucose decreased within normal range. Two patients with type 2 diabetes produced significantly less Ã-hydroxybutyrate. Courses for Ã-hydroxybutyrate and glucose showed a weak inverse correlation, while no serious adverse effects could be observed.              Conclusion:                    Medically supervised fasting with definite small amounts of carbohydrates by fluid intake may lead to limited increases of ketone bodies in their biopositive range, as known e.g. from epileptology or sports medicine. Clinical consequences deserve further research.",-1
Circular RNA ITCH: An Emerging Multifunctional Regulator,"In the last decade, numerous circRNAs were discovered by virtue of the RNA-Seq technique. With the deepening of experimental research, circRNAs have brought to light the key biological functions and progression of human diseases. CircRNA ITCH has been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor in numerous cancers, and recently it was found to play an important role in bone diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases. However, the functions of circ-ITCH have not been completely understood. In this review, we comprehensively provide a conceptual framework to elucidate circ-ITCH biological functions of cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, and the pathological mechanisms of inflammation, drug resistance/toxicity, and tumorigenesis. Finally, we summarize its clinical applications in various diseases. This research aimed at clarifying the role of circ-ITCH, which could be a promising therapeutic target.",-1
The effect of caloric restriction and fasting on cancer,"Cancer is one of the most frequent causes of worldwide death and morbidity and is a major public health problem. Although, there are several widely used treatment methods including chemo-, immune- and radiotherapies, these mostly lack sufficient efficiency and induce toxicities in normal surrounding tissues. Thus, finding new approaches to mitigate side effects and potentially accelerate treatment is paramount. In line with this, increasing preclinical evidence indicates that caloric restriction (CR) and fasting might have anticancer effects by reducing tumor progression, enhancing death of cancer cells, and elevating the effectiveness and tolerability of chemo- and radiotherapies. Nonetheless, clinical studies assessing the potential of CR and fasting in cancer are scarce and inconsistent, and more investigations are still required to clarify their effect in different aspects of cancer treatment. In this review, we have summarized the findings of preclinical and clinical studies of CR and fasting with respect to efficacy and on the adverse effects of standard cancer treatments.",-1
Stem cell-homing hydrogel-based miR-29b-5p delivery promotes cartilage regeneration by suppressing senescence in an osteoarthritis rat model,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease characterized by progressive loss of cartilage and reduction in lubricating synovial fluid, which lacks effective treatments currently. Here, we propose a hydrogel-based miRNA delivery strategy to rejuvenate impaired cartilage by creating a regenerative microenvironment to mitigate chondrocyte senescence that mainly contributes to cartilage breakdown during OA development. An aging-related miRNA, miR-29b-5p, was first found to be markedly down-regulated in OA cartilage, and their up-regulation suppressed the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and senescence-associated genes (P16INK4a/P21) via ten-eleven-translocation enzyme 1 (TET1). An injectable bioactive self-assembling peptide nanofiber hydrogel was applied to deliver agomir-29b-5p, which was functionalized by conjugating a stem cell-homing peptide SKPPGTSS for endogenous synovial stem cell recruitment simultaneously. Sustained miR-29b-5p delivery and recruitment of synovial stem cells and their subsequent differentiation into chondrocytes led to successful cartilage repair and chondrocyte rejuvenation. This strategy enables miRNA-based therapeutic modality to become a viable alternative for surgery in OA treatment.",-1
Pathways regulating equine skeletal muscle protein synthesis respond in a dose-dependent manner to graded levels of protein intake,"Activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-controlled anabolic signaling pathways in skeletal muscle of rodents and humans is responsive to the level of dietary protein supply, with maximal activation and rates of protein synthesis achieved with 0.2 to 0.4 g protein/kg body weight (BW). In horses, few data are available on the required level of dietary protein to maximize protein synthesis for maintenance and growth of skeletal muscle. To evaluate the effect of dietary protein level on muscle mTOR pathway activation, five mares received different amounts of a protein supplement that provided 0, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 g of crude protein (CP)/kg BW per meal in a 5 Ã 5 Latin square design. On each sample day, horses were fasted overnight and were fed only their protein meal the following morning. A preprandial (0 min) and postprandial (90 min) blood sample was collected and a gluteus medius muscle sample was obtained 90 min after feeding the protein meal. Blood samples were analyzed for glucose, insulin, and amino acid concentrations. Activation of mTOR pathway components (mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 [rpS6]) in the muscle samples was measured by Western immunoblot analysis. Postprandial plasma glucose (P = 0.007) and insulin (P = 0.09) showed a quadratic increase, while total essential amino acid (P < 0.0001) concentrations increased linearly with the graded intake of the protein supplement. Activation of mTOR (P = 0.02) and its downstream target, rpS6 (P = 0.0008), increased quadratically and linearly in relation to the level of protein intake, respectively. Comparisons of individual doses showed no differences (P > 0.05) between the 0.25 and 0.5 g of protein intake for either mTOR or rpS6 activation, indicating that protein synthesis may have reached near maximal capacity around 0.25 g CP/kg BW. This is the first study to show that the activation of muscle protein synthetic pathways in horses is dose-dependent on the level of protein intake. Consumption of a moderate dose of high-quality protein resulted in near maximal muscle mTOR pathway activation in mature, sedentary horses.",-1
miR-144-3p/miR-451a promotes lymphovascular invasion through repression of PTEN/p19 in rectal neuroendocrine tumors,"Background and aim:                    Although rectal neuroendocrine tumor (NET-G1) have potential metastatic capability, even among small tumors, no predictive biomarker for invasion and metastasis has been reported. We analyzed microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in rectal NET-G1 tissues with and without lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Moreover, we then investigated their target genes to clarify the mechanism of invasion/metastasis in NET-G1.              Methods:                    miRNA array analysis was performed using seven rectal NET-G1 tissues with LVI and seven without LVI. miRNA expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. A NET cell line H727 was transfected with miRNA mimic or target gene small interfering RNA, and migration and invasion assays were performed.              Results:                    The expression levels of miR-144-3p and miR-451a were significantly higher in NET-G1 with LVI versus without LVI, as determined by miRNA array analysis and RT-qPCR. A significant correlation was observed between miR-144-3p and miR-451a expression levels, strongly suggesting miR144/451 cluster overexpression in NET-G1 with LVI. Bioinformatic analysis of target genes revealed that miR-144-3p and miR-451a directly interact with PTEN and p19 mRNA, respectively. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly lower expression of PTEN and p19 in NET-G1 tissues with LVI than in those without LVI. The miR-144-3p and miR-451a mimic significantly increased cell migration/invasion capability, respectively. Knockdown of PTEN and p19 induced significant augmentation of cell invasion and migration capability, respectively.              Conclusions:                    Our data suggest that overexpression of miR-144/miR-451 cluster promotes LVI via repression of PTEN and p19 in rectal NET-G1 cells. miR-144/451 cluster may be a novel biomarker for predicting invasion/metastasis in rectal NET-G1.",-1
Omics Analyses of Intestinal Microbiota and Hypothalamus Clock Genes in Circadian Disturbance Model Mice Fed with Green Tea Polyphenols,"Green tea polyphenols (GTP) have similar activities as prebiotics, which effectively regulate the structure of intestinal flora and affect their metabolic pathways. The intestinal flora is closely related to the host's circadian rhythm, and the supplementation with GTP may be an effective way to improve circadian rhythm disorders. In this study, we established a mouse model of circadian rhythm disturbance of anthropogenic flora to investigate the regulation mechanism of GTP on the host circadian rhythms. After 4 weeks of GTP administration, the results showed that GTP significantly alleviated the structural disorder of intestinal microbiota, thus effectively regulating related metabolites associated with brain nerves and circadian rhythms. Moreover, single-cell transcription of the mouse hypothalamus suggested that GTP up-regulated the number of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and adjusted the expression of core clock genes Csnk1d, Clock, Per3, Cry2, and BhIhe41 caused by circadian disruption. Therefore, this study provided evidence that GTP can improve the physiological health of hosts with the circadian disorder by positively affecting intestinal flora and related metabolites and regulating circadian gene expression.",-1
Impact of recent climate extremes on mosquito-borne disease transmission in Kenya,"Climate change and variability influence temperature and rainfall, which impact vector abundance and the dynamics of vector-borne disease transmission. Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events. Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Freshwater availability and temperature affect dengue vector populations via a variety of biological processes and thus influence the ability of mosquitoes to effectively transmit disease. However, the effect of droughts, floods, heat waves, and cold waves is not well understood. Using vector, climate, and dengue disease data collected between 2013 and 2019 in Kenya, this retrospective cohort study aims to elucidate the impact of extreme rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the risk of arboviral infections. To define extreme periods of rainfall and land surface temperature (LST), we calculated monthly anomalies as deviations from long-term means (1983-2019 for rainfall, 2000-2019 for LST) across four study locations in Kenya. We classified extreme climate events as the upper and lower 10% of these calculated LST or rainfall deviations. Monthly Ae. aegypti abundance was recorded in Kenya using four trapping methods. Blood samples were also collected from children with febrile illness presenting to four field sites and tested for dengue virus using an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found that mosquito eggs and adults were significantly more abundant one month following an abnormally wet month. The relationship between mosquito abundance and dengue risk follows a non-linear association. Our findings suggest that early warnings and targeted interventions during periods of abnormal rainfall and temperature, especially flooding, can potentially contribute to reductions in risk of viral transmission.",-1
Putting the Nonsocial Into Social Neuroscience: A Role for Domain-General Priority Maps During Social Interactions,"Whether on a first date or during a team briefing at work, people's daily lives are inundated with social information, and in recent years, researchers have begun studying the neural mechanisms that support social-information processing. We argue that the focus of social neuroscience research to date has been skewed toward specialized processes at the expense of general processing mechanisms with a consequence that unrealistic expectations have been set for what specialized processes alone can achieve. We propose that for social neuroscience to develop into a more mature research program, it needs to embrace hybrid models that integrate specialized person representations with domain-general solutions, such as prioritization and selection, which operate across all classes of information (both social and nonsocial). To illustrate our central arguments, we first describe and then evaluate a hybrid model of information processing during social interactions that (a) generates novel and falsifiable predictions compared with existing models; (b) is predicated on a wealth of neurobiological evidence spanning many decades, methods, and species; (c) requires a superior standard of evidence to substantiate domain-specific mechanisms of social behavior; and (d) transforms expectations of what types of neural mechanisms may contribute to social-information processing in both typical and atypical populations.",-1
Alginate and its Two Components Acted Differently Against Dopaminergic Neuronal Loss in Parkinson's Disease Mice Model,"Scope:                    This study aims to investigate and compare the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms for brown seaweed polysaccharides (PS) of Alginate (Alg) and its two components, including polymannuronic acid (PM) and polyguluronic acid (PG), against Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis.              Methods and results:                    Model mice of PD are pretreated with Alg or PM or PG, separately via oral gavage once per day for four weeks. Our results found PM improved motor functions of PD mice, but Alg or PG did not. PM or PG, but not Alg, can prevent dopaminergic neuronal loss by increasing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressions in midbrain of PD mice. The neuroprotective effects of PM rely on its anti-inflammation effects and its ability to improve striatal neurotransmitters (serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA)) levels in PD mice. PM inhibits inflammation, but PG or Alg induces inflammation in systemic circulation of PD mice. The neuroprotection provided by PG might be related to its ability to increase striatal neurotransmitter of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid levels in PD mice.              Conclusion:                    PM plays better than PG to provide neuroprotection, but Alg did not show any neuroprotection against PD. Alg and its two components acted differently in preventing dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice.",-1
Impact of microplastics on the intestinal microbiota: A systematic review of preclinical evidence,"Aims:                    We systematically review the in vivo preclinical evidence on the impact of microplastics (MPs) on the intestinal microbiota and morphofunctional changes involving the intestinal mucosa.              Methods:                    By using a comprehensive and structured search in electronic databases 28 original studies were recovered and analyzed.              Key findings:                    Zebrafish and mice were the main animal models, while the dose and shape of MPs used were quite heterogeneous. Studies show that MPs are potential triggers of intestinal dysbiosis, which has been characterized by enrichment of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Chlamydia. Conversely, there was a reduction in Bacteroidetes phylum abundance. By trapping and stimulating intestinal inflammatory infiltrate, exposure to MPs increased intestinal permeability and the expression of immune signatures associated with inflammation, such as IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³ and IL-6.              Significance:                    Thus, current evidence supports potential inflammatory and dysbiotic properties of MPs. In addition, the data indicate that MPs can display structural changes secondary to exposure to MPs. Analysis of methodological quality indicated that current preclinical evidence is at high risk of bias. We hope that controlling that bias sources described in this systematic review will be useful to improve the quality of reports.",-1
Analysis of colonic mucosa-associated microbiota using endoscopically collected lavage,"The bacterial composition of the gut lumen and mucosa is distinct and the mucosa-associated bacteria are thought to play a more critical role in interactions with the host immune system. However, limited studies of the gut mucosal microbiota in humans have been available due to methodological challenges. Here, we evaluated the potential use of colonic lavage samples for mucosal microbiota analysis in humans. Among the different types of colonic mucosal samples collected from healthy volunteers, the lavage samples contained a higher amount of bacterial DNA and were less contaminated with host DNA compared to mucosal brushing (brush) and biopsy. Although 16S gene amplicon sequencing showed that the bacterial composition of the lavage was intermediate between that of feces and biopsy, mucosal bacteria abundant in the biopsy were also enriched in lavage samples. Furthermore, differences in mucosal microbes between non-smokers and smokers were detectable in lavage samples. Our data emphasize that colonic lavage is suitable for analysis of the mucosal microbiota. Given its minimal invasiveness and high bacterial DNA content, the colonic lavage will promote research on the human mucosal microbiota, especially in gastrointestinal disorders.",-1
The combined therapy of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation and resveratrol for diabetes: Future applications and challenges,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a worldwide chronic epidemic disease of impaired glucose metabolism. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is considered a promising emerging treatment strategy for diabetes. However, the harsh internal environment of DM patients can inhibit the treatment effects of transplanted MSCs. Fortunately, this adverse effect can be reversed by resveratrol (Res). Therefore, we investigated and summarized relevant studies on the combined treatment of diabetes with MSCs and resveratrol. This review presents the therapeutic effects of this combination therapy strategy on DM in glycemic control, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress and anti-fibrotic. Moreover, this review explained the mechanisms of MSCs and resveratrol in diabetes treatment from 3 aspects, including promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis, inhibiting histiocyte fibrosis, and improving glucose metabolism. These findings help to understand in-depth mechanisms of the treatment of DM and help to propose a potential treatment strategy for DM and its complications.",-1
Estrogen and voluntary exercise attenuate cardiometabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis in ovariectomized rats fed a high-fat high-fructose diet,"The prevalence of cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) is increased in women after menopause. While hormone replacement therapy has been prescribed to relieve several components of CMS in postmenopausal women, some aspects of cardiometabolic dysfunction cannot be completely restored. The present study examined the effectiveness of estrogen replacement alone and in combination with exercise by voluntary wheel running (VWR) for alleviating the risks of CMS, insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose transport, and hepatic fat accumulation in ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat high-fructose diet (OHFFD). We compared a sham-operated group with OHFFD rats that were subdivided into a sedentary, estradiol replacement (E2), and E2 plus VWR for 12 wk. E2 prevented the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle glucose transport and decreased hepatic fat accumulation in OHFFD rats. Furthermore, E2 treatment decreased visceral fat mass and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in OHFFD rats, while VWR further decreased LDL-cholesterol and increased the ratio of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol to total cholesterol to a greater extent. Although E2 treatment alone did not reduce serum triglyceride levels in OHFFD rats, the combined intervention of E2 and VWR lowered serum triglycerides in E2-treated OHFFD rats. The addition of VWR to E2-treated OHFFD rats led to AMPK activation and upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³) coactivator-1Î± and PPARÎ´ in skeletal muscle along with increased fatty acid oxidation and suppressed fatty acid synthesis in the liver. Collectively, our findings indicate that, to achieve greater health benefits, physical exercise is required for E2-treated individuals under ovarian hormone deprivation with high-energy consumption.",-1
"Epidemiologic, Imaging, and Clinical Issues in Bezold's Abscess: A Systematic Review","Bezold's abscess is a deep neck abscess related to otomastoiditis. Due to the insidious clinical presentation, diagnosis can be extremely challenging, leading to delays in treatment and possible life-threatening complications. The literature currently provides a fragmented picture, presenting only single or small number of cases. The present study aims at examining our experience and the literature findings (based on PRISMA criteria) of 97 patients with Bezold's abscess, summarizing their epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatments. Bezold's abscess is found at any age, with overt male prevalence among adults. The clinical presentation, as well as the causative pathogens, are strikingly heterogeneous. Otomastoiditis and cholesteatoma are major risk factors. A clinical history of otitis is commonly reported (43%). CT and MRI are the main diagnostic tools, proving the erosion of the mastoid tip in 53% of patients and the presence of a concomitant cholesteatoma in 40%. Intracranial vascular (24%) or infectious (9%) complications have also been reported. Diagnosis might be easily achieved when imaging (CT) is properly applied. MRI has a limited diagnostic role, but it might be crucial whenever intracranial complications or the coexistence of cholesteatoma are suspected, helping to develop proper treatment (prompt antibiotic therapy and surgery).",-1
Psoriasis and Systemic Inflammatory Disorders,"Psoriasis is a representative inflammatory skin disease occupied by large surface involvement. As inflammatory cells and cytokines can systemically circulate in various organs, it has been speculated that psoriatic skin inflammation influences the systemic dysfunction of various organs. Recent updates of clinical studies and experimental studies showed the important interaction of psoriasis to systemic inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the importance of systemic therapy in severe psoriasis is also highlighted to prevent the development of systemic inflammatory diseases. In this review, we introduced representative systemic inflammatory diseases associated with psoriasis and the detailed molecular mechanisms.",-1
LncRNA LINC01270 aggravates the progression of gastric cancer through modulation of miR-326/EFNA3 axis,"Gastric cancer (GC) is lethal malignancy, which is associated with high mortality. Long noncoding RNA LINC01270 has been identified to act as a potential oncogene in several cancers. However, its role and related regulatory mechanism in GC are yet to be illustrated. The levels of lncRNA LINC01270, miR-326, and EphrinA3 (EFNA3) were assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays were applied for analyzing cell proliferation. Transwell assay was used for measuring cellular migration and invasion. Western blot analysis was employed for evaluating the protein levels. Luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays were utilized to verify the binding ability between LINC01270 (or EFNA3) and miR-326. Our findings indicated that LINC01270 expression was significantly up-regulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Additionally, LINC01270 knockdown attenuated GC progression through inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Functional experiments identified that lncRNA LINC01270 could positively regulate EFNA3 expression by serving as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-326. Through rescue assays, inhibition of GC progression caused by LINC01270 suppression was found to be reversed by the application of miR-326 inhibitor or EFNA3 overexpression. Overall, our work demonstrated that lncRNA LINC01270 can accelerate cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via modulating miR-326/EFNA3 axis. These findings might implicate the potential role of lncRNA LINC01270 in GC treatment.",-1
Impact of Visceral Adipose Tissue on Clinical Outcomes After Acute Ischemic Stroke,"Background and Purpose- The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between adiposity using adipose tissue imaging and stroke outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Methods- A total of 127 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis who underwent abdominal computed tomography on admission were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Patients were grouped according to their visceral adipose tissue (VAT) proportion tertile. The primary outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale 3 months after symptom onset. Favorable and excellent outcomes were defined as modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2 and 0 to 1, respectively. Results- As VAT proportion tertile increased, the number of patients exhibiting a favorable or excellent outcome decreased. In the final multivariable analysis after adjustments for confounders, patients in the highest VAT proportion tertile showed a decreased probability of a favorable and excellent outcome compared with those in the lowest tertile (odds ratio=0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.60; P=0.005 and odds ratio=0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.64; P=0.012, respectively). Obese patients (body mass index â?5) also showed an excellent outcome compared with nonobese patients (odds ratio=4.88; 95% CI, 1.47-7.85; P=0.011). Among obese patients, those with an excellent outcome presented a significantly lower VAT proportion than those without (38.2% versus 46.1%, P=0.006). Conclusions- Results of this study indicate that low visceral abdominal fat proportion is associated with a favorable and excellent outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Better clinical outcomes in obese patients were also associated with a lower proportion of VAT.",-1
The application of spectroscopy techniques for diagnosis of malaria parasites and arboviruses and surveillance of mosquito vectors: A systematic review and critical appraisal of evidence,"The potential of RS as a surveillance tool for malaria and arbovirus vectors and MIRS for the diagnosis and surveillance of arboviruses is yet to be assessed. NIRS capacity as a surveillance tool for malaria and arbovirus vectors should be validated under field conditions, and its potential as a diagnostic tool for malaria and arboviruses needs to be evaluated. It is recommended that all 3 techniques evaluated simultaneously using multiple machine learning techniques in multiple epidemiological settings to determine the most accurate technique for each application. Prior to their field application, a standardised protocol for spectra collection and data analysis should be developed. This will harmonise their application in multiple field settings allowing easy and faster integration into existing disease control platforms. Ultimately, development of rapid and cost-effective point-of-care diagnostic tools for malaria and arboviruses based on spectroscopy techniques may help combat current and future outbreaks of these infectious diseases.",-1
The Microbiota of Three Anopheles Species in China,"Microbiota are vital for the development, physiology, and vectorial capacity of mosquitoes. The composition and role of microbiota in Anopheles species, especially Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi, have been extensively studied, but little is known about the microbiota of Anopheles species in China. We characterized the microbial communities of Anopheles dirus, Anopheles sinensis, and Anopheles lesteri by 16S rRNA sequencing. There were distinct differences in the composition of microbiota in An. lesteri and the other 2 species. The discriminatory genera in the 3 species were analyzed by the linear discriminant analysis effect size method. Our results provide an overview of the population structure of microbiota in 3 native Anopheles species and will pave the way for further understanding of their role in mosquito physiology and vector competence.",-1
Exploring the Possible Link between the Gut Microbiome and Fat Deposition in Pigs,"Excessive lipid accumulation and high oxidative stress have become a serious health and economic problem in the pig industry. Fatness characteristics are crucial in pig production since they are closely related to meat quality. The gut microbiome is well acknowledged as a key element in fat deposition. But the link between gut microbiota and fat accumulation in pigs remains elusive. To examine whether there is a link between pigs' gut microbiome, lipogenic properties, and oxidative stress, we selected 5 high-fat pigs and 5 low-fat pigs from 60 250-day-old Jinhua pigs in the present study and collected the colon content, serum sample, and liver and abdominal fat segments from each pig for metagenomic analysis, the oxidative stress assay, and RT-qPCR analysis, respectively. The backfat thickness and fat content of the longissimus dorsi muscle were considerably higher in the high-fat pigs than in the low-fat pigs (P < 0.05). An obvious difference in GSH-Px and MDA in the serum between the high- and low-fat pigs was observed. After RT-qPCR analysis, we found the gene expression of ACC1 and SREBP1 in the liver and FAS, PPARÎ³, and LPL in the abdominal fat were significantly higher in high-fat pigs than in low-fat pigs (P < 0.05). Additionally, metagenomic sequencing revealed that high-fat pigs had a higher abundance of Archaeal species with methanogenesis functions, leading to more-efficient fat deposition, while low-fat pigs had higher abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria species that improved the formation of SCFAs, especially butyrate, thus alleviating fat deposition in pigs. Furthermore, a total of 17 CAZyme families were identified to give significant enrichments in different fat phenotypes of pigs. This study would provide a detailed understanding of how the gut microbiome influences fat deposition in pigs, as well as a hint for improving growth performance and fatness traits by manipulating the gut microbiome.",-1
The graying of integrated health: the specialized role of psychology in geriatric primary care,"Objectives:                    Integrating behavioral health services into primary care is an important global initiative to improve access to mental health services. Within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Geriatric Patient Aligned Care Teams (GeriPACTs) are one model of integrated care for frail older adults to serve older Veterans with geriatric syndromes and increased probability of cognitive impairment. Understanding of the role of psychology in GeriPACT is limited. This study examines this role, describes the practice of these psychologists, and evaluates the integration of psychology into geriatric primary care.              Methods:                    A mixed-methods design was used. Recruitment occurred through two VHA listservs for GeriPACT and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) psychologists. Surveys examined referral processes, service access, clinical services provision, and use of psychotherapy modalities. Twenty psychologists participated. Structured follow-up interviews were conducted with five participants.              Results:                    A large minority of psychologists did not have FTE allotted for GeriPACT work they provided (40%). Sixty percent were assigned to one GeriPACT team. Twenty percent served four to seven GeriPACT teams. Eighty percent provided same-day services. Cognitive assessment was provided weekly by over sixty percent of providers who had FTE allotment to this role. Qualitative data provided a rich description of psychologists' perceptions of their role, team functioning, referral processes, visit structure, and other factors.              Conclusion:                    Findings are discussed in the context of the World Health Organization's guidelines for integrating mental health into primary care. Data suggest a need for an integrated model that adapts to the special needs of older adults in primary care.",-1
Tooth detection for each tooth type by application of faster R-CNNs to divided analysis areas of dental panoramic X-ray images,"This study aimed to propose a computerized method for detecting the tooth region for each tooth type as the initial stage in the development of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme for dental panoramic X-ray images. Our database consists of 160 panoramic dental X-ray images obtained from 160 adult patients. To reduce false positives (FPs), the proposed method first extracts a rectangular area including all teeth from a dental panoramic X-ray image with a faster region using a convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN). From the rectangular area including all teeth, six divided areas are then extracted with Faster R-CNN: top left, top center, top right, bottom left, bottom center, and bottom right. Faster R-CNNs for detecting tooth regions for each tooth type were trained individually for each of the divided areas that narrowed down the target tooth types. By applying these Faster R-CNNs to each divided area, the bounding boxes of each tooth were detected and classified into 32 tooth types. A k-fold cross-validation method with k = 4 was used for training and testing the proposed method. The detection rate for each tooth, number of FPs per image, mean intersection over union for each tooth, and classification accuracy for the 32 tooth types were 98.9%, 0.415, 0.748, and 91.7%, respectively, showing an improvement compared to the application of the Faster R-CNN once to the entire image (98.0%, 1.194, 0.736, and 88.8%).",-1
"Long-term impact of systematic pain and sedation management on cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes of extremely preterm infants at preschool age","Background:                    Providing optimal pain relief is a challenging task when caring for premature infants. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term cognitive, motor, and behavioral outcomes of preterm infants before and after the implementation of a pain and sedation protocol. In addition, we investigated whether the increased opiate administration resulting after the implementation process had an impact on these outcomes.              Methods:                    Cognitive outcomes were evaluated using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC), neuromotor examinations were based on Amiel-Tison, and behavioral outcomes were assessed using the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).              Results:                    One hundred extremely preterm infants were included in the study (control group, n = 53; intervention group, n = 47). No significant differences were found in cognitive and motor outcomes at preschool age. However, every increase in the cumulative opiate exposure for each 100 mg/kg was weakly significantly associated with a higher risk for autism spectrum features (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.822, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.231-2.697]; P = 0.03) and withdrawn behavior (aOR = 1.822, 95% CI [1.231-2.697]; P = 0.03) at preschool age.              Conclusion:                    Increased neonatal cumulative opiate exposure did not alter cognitive and motor outcomes but may represent a risk factor for autism spectrum and withdrawn behavior at preschool age.              Impact:                    The implementation of a protocol for the management of pain and sedation in preterm infants resulted in increased cumulative opiate exposure. Our study adds further evidence that increased neonatal opiate exposure did not alter cognitive and motor outcomes but may yield a potential risk factor for autism spectrum disorders and withdrawn behavior at preschool age. A vigilant use of opiates is recommended. Further studies are needed looking for novel pain management strategies and drugs providing optimal pain relief with minimal neurotoxicity.",-1
Genetic variability in exon 1 of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 is associated with postoperative complications,"Patients undergoing major surgery experience postoperative inflammation, which may contribute to postoperative morbidity. Endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) are an essential part of the stress response, but this response varies between individuals, which may in turn affect clinical outcome and specifically postoperative inflammation. Exon 1 of the NR3C1 gene, encoding the GC receptor (GR), contains an established region of differential regulation. DNA methylation patterns in this region have been found to differ between individuals. The present study investigated the methylation status and genotype in the cytosineâphosphateâguanine (CpG) island in exon 1 of NR3C1 in 24 patients [Median age 65.5 (range 42â?1) years, 11 male, 13 female] who underwent major abdominal (12 pancreatic, 12 hepatic) surgery and explored its association with postoperative complications. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and underwent targeted bisulfite sequencing of the CpG island. Complications were graded according to the ClavienâDindo classification and 14 out of 24 patients had postoperative complications. Multifactorial and partial least square analyses were used to analyse the data. A homogenous demethylated pattern was observed in all patients and no single CpG methylation was associated with postoperative complications. Four SNPs were significantly associated with higher ClavienâDindo scores. Genetic variability in the chromosome 5:143,402,505â?43,405,805 region of exon 1 of the GR gene NR3C1, but not DNA methylation, was associated with more severe postoperative complications in patients having major abdominal surgery. These results indicated that the patients' response to GCs may be of clinical importance for inflammatory conditions.",-1
A multi-attack intrusion detection model based on Mosaic coded convolutional neural network and centralized encoding,"With the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), attacks to the vehicle-mounted control area network (CAN) have seriously jeopardized the security of automobiles. As an important security measure, intrusion detection technologies have aroused great interest in researchers and many detection methods have also been proposed based on the vehicle's CAN bus. However, many studies only considered one type of attack at a time but in real environments there may contain a variety of attack types simultaneously. In view of the deficiency in the current methods, this paper proposed a method to detect multi-intrusions at one time based on a Mosaic coded convolutional neural network (CNN) and a centralized coding method. A Mosaic-like data block was created to convert the one-dimensional CAN ID into a two-dimensional data grid for the CNN to effectively extract the data characteristics and maintain the time characteristics between the CAN IDs. Four types of attacks and all combinations of them were used to train and test our model. Finally, a centralized coding method was used to increase the discrimination capability of the model. Experimental results showed that this single model could successfully detect any combinations of the intrusion types with very high and stable performance.",-1
"In vitro digestion and microbial fermentation of dried food residues, a potential ""new"" component for pet food, and different non-digestible carbohydrate sources","Food residues are often fed to dogs in private households and might also be a potential ""new"" ingredient for pet food in the future. As food residues might contain not only digestible, but also fermentable substrates, an effect on the intestinal microbiota can be assumed. In the present study, two batches of dried food residues (DFR) collected from hotels in Crete were microbially fermented in an in vitro batch culture system with canine fecal inoculum: non-sterile DFR including meat (DFRm), sterile DFR including meat (DFRms) and sterile DFR without meat (DFRwms). Different non-digestible carbohydrate sources (beet pulp, wheat bran, inulin, carrot pomace, brewerÂ´s spent grains, cellulose and lignocellulose) were included for comparison. Inulin, cellulose and lignocellulose were only used as raw materials, while the other test substrates were incubated as raw and enzymatically pre-digested substrates. After incubation for 24 hours, the raw food residues markedly increased the concentrations of bacterial metabolites in the fermenters, although smaller effects were observed for the DFRwms. When the enzymatically pre-digested food residues were incubated, the effects were more pronounced for the DFRms and DFRwms. In general, when compared with the other test substrates, the food residues were microbially fermented to a comparable or partly higher extent. Interestingly, high n-butyrate concentrations were measured in the inocula, both after incubation of the raw and pre-digested food residues. In conclusion, the food residues contained enzymatically digestible and microbially fermentable substrates. If considered as a potential future ingredient for pet food, a standardization of the collection and processing of food residues might be necessary in order to reduce compositional variability and varying effects on the intestinal microbiota.",-1
Dysregulation of miRNAs Levels in Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3Î² Overexpressing Mice and the Role of miR-221-5p in Synaptic Function,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (GSK-3Î²) is a highly expressed kinase in the brain, where it has an important role in synaptic plasticity. Aberrant activity of GSK-3Î² leads to synaptic dysfunction which results in the development of several neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases. Notably, overexpression of constitutively active form of GSK-3Î² (GSK-3Î²[S9A]) in mice recapitulates the cognitive and structural defects characteristic for neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which GSK-3Î² regulates synaptic functions are not clearly known. Here, we investigate the effects of GSK-3Î² overactivity on neuronal miRNA expression in the mouse hippocampus. We found that GSK-3Î² overactivity downregulates miRNA network with a potent effect on miR-221-5p (miR-221*). Next, characterization of miR-221* function in primary hippocampal cell culture transfected by miR-221* inhibitor, showed no structural changes in dendritic spine shape and density. Using electrophysiological methods, we found that downregulation of miR-221* increases excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons, probably via postsynaptic mechanisms. Thus, our data reveal potential mechanism by which GSK-3Î² and miRNAs might regulate synaptic function and therefore also synaptic plasticity.",-1
Protein Misfolding and Aggregation: The Relatedness between Parkinson's Disease and Hepatic Endoplasmic Reticulum Storage Disorders,"Dysfunction of cellular homeostasis can lead to misfolding of proteins thus acquiring conformations prone to polymerization into pathological aggregates. This process is associated with several disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), and endoplasmic reticulum storage disorders (ERSDs), like alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and hereditary hypofibrinogenemia with hepatic storage (HHHS). Given the shared pathophysiological mechanisms involved in such conditions, it is necessary to deepen our understanding of the basic principles of misfolding and aggregation akin to these diseases which, although heterogeneous in symptomatology, present similarities that could lead to potential mutual treatments. Here, we review: (i) the pathological bases leading to misfolding and aggregation of proteins involved in PD, AATD, and HHHS: alpha-synuclein, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and fibrinogen, respectively, (ii) the evidence linking each protein aggregation to the stress mechanisms occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of each pathology, (iii) a comparison of the mechanisms related to dysfunction of proteostasis and regulation of homeostasis between the diseases (such as the unfolded protein response and/or autophagy), (iv) and clinical perspectives regarding possible common treatments focused on improving the defensive responses to protein aggregation for diseases as different as PD, and ERSDs.",-1
Research on Feature Extraction and Chinese Translation Method of Internet-of-Things English Terminology,"Feature extraction and Chinese translation of Internet-of-Things English terms are the basis of many natural language processing. Its main purpose is to extract rich semantic information from unstructured texts to allow computers to further calculate and process them to meet different types of NLP-based tasks. However, most of the current methods use simple neural network models to count the word frequency or probability of words in the text, and it is difficult to accurately understand and translate IoT English terms. In response to this problem, this study proposes a neural network for feature extraction and Chinese translation of IoT English terms based on LSTM, which can not only correctly extract and translate IoT English vocabulary but also realize the feature correspondence between English and Chinese. The neural network proposed in this study has been tested and trained on multiple datasets, and it basically fulfills the requirements of feature translation and Chinese translation of Internet-of-Things terms in English and has great potential in the follow-up work.",-1
Analysis of the therapeutic effect of Dimu Ningshen (TCM formula) on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on gut microbiota and serum metabolomics,"Background:                    Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed during adolescence and adulthood. Assessment of the long-term risks of the current drugs for ADHD treatment has been insufficient, and little is known concerning the long-term therapeutic effects of psychostimulants. Commercially available traditional Chinese medicine compound oral preparations [e.g., Dimu Ningshen (DMNS)] have been widely used in the clinical treatment of ADHD, but their influence on the interaction between gut microbes and potential metabolomes remains inconclusive.              Methods:                    We used a series of behavioral experiments to evaluate the behavioral effects of DMNS on adolescent and adult ADHD rats and used 16S rDNA sequencing of gut microbes and nontarget metabolomics to evaluate the potential pathogenesis of ADHD and explore the biological mechanism of DMNS in ADHD treatment.              Results:                    For the first time, DMNS was shown to reduce the excessive activity of adult and adolescent ADHD rats and improve the attention deficit of adult ADHD rats. DMNS improved the structural composition of the ADHD gut microbiota and reduced the abundance of Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214_group, Ruminococcus_2, and Eubacterium_nodatum_group. Simultaneously, DMNS increased the circulating levels of peripheral monoamine neurotransmitter precursors (e.g., phenylalanine) and reduced the circulating levels of peripheral fatty acid amides (e.g., oleamide). Finally, the changes in the ADHD serum metabolites were strongly correlated with the gut microbiota.              Conclusion:                    DMNS has a good effect in treating ADHD, and it may exert this effect by regulating the gut microbiota and affecting metabolites in the peripheral circulation.",-1
"Cytosolic GPR37, but not GPR37L1, multimerization and its reversal by Parkin: A live cell imaging study","Biochemical data have shown aggregated G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) in the cytoplasm and Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD). Properly folded GPR37 at the plasma membrane appears to be neuroprotective. GPR37, and its homologue GPR37L1, are orphan G protein-coupled receptors and their homo- and hetero-dimers have not been established. We therefore examined GPR37 and GPR37L1 dimerization and extended studies of multimerization of GPR37 to live cells. In this study, we investigated GPR37 and GPR37L1 dimerization and multimerization in live cells using three quantitative imaging methods: Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy, FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer, and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy. Our data show that GPR37 and GPR37L1 form homo- and heterodimers in live N2a cells. Importantly, aggregation of GPR37, but not GPR37L1, was identified in the cytoplasm, which could be counteracted by Parkin overexpression. These data provide further evidence that GPR37 participate in cytosolic aggregation processes implicated in PD pathology.",-1
Recent Advances in the Treatment of Insulin Resistance Targeting Molecular and Metabolic Pathways: Fighting a Losing Battle?,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is amongst the most notable causes of years of life lost worldwide and its prevalence increases perpetually. The disease is characterized as multisystemic dysfunctions attributed to hyperglycemia resulting directly from insulin resistance (IR), inadequate insulin secretion, or enormous glucagon secretion. Insulin is a highly anabolic peptide hormone that regulates blood glucose levels by hastening cellular glucose uptake as well as controlling carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. In the course of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), which accounts for nearly 90% of all cases of diabetes, the insulin response is inadequate, and this condition is defined as Insulin Resistance. IR sequela include, but are not limited to, hyperglycemia, cardiovascular system impairment, chronic inflammation, disbalance in oxidative stress status, and metabolic syndrome occurrence. Despite the substantial progress in understanding the molecular and metabolic pathways accounting for injurious effects of IR towards multiple body organs, IR still is recognized as a ferocious enigma. The number of widely available therapeutic approaches is growing, however, the demand for precise, safe, and effective therapy is also increasing. A literature search was carried out using the MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, SCOPUS and Clinical Trials Registry databases with a combination of keywords and MeSH terms, and papers published from February 2021 to March 2022 were selected as recently published papers. This review paper aims to provide critical, concise, but comprehensive insights into the advances in the treatment of IR that were achieved in the last months.",-1
Posttransplantation Diabetes Mellitus Among Solid Organ Recipients in a Danish Cohort,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. We aimed to describe the proportion of patients with diabetes prior to solid organ transplantation (SOT) and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) in three time periods (early-likely PTDM: 0-45 days; 46-365 days and >365 days) post-transplant and to estimate possible risk factors associated with PTDM in each time-period. Additionally, we compared the risk of death and causes of death in patients with diabetes prior to transplant, PTDM, and non-diabetes patients. A total of 959 SOT recipients (heart, lung, liver, and kidney) transplanted at University Hospital of Copenhagen between 2010 and 2015 were included. The highest PTDM incidence was observed at 46-365 days after transplant in all SOT recipients. Age and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI Score) in all time periods were the two most important risk factors for PTDM. Compared to non-diabetes patients, SOT recipients with pre-transplant diabetes and PTDM patients had a higher risk of all-cause mortality death (aHR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.16-2.69 and aHR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.17-3.06 respectively). Pre-transplant diabetes and PTDM patients had a higher risk of death due to cardiovascular diseases and cancer, respectively, when compared to non-diabetes patients.",-1
Circular RNA circ_0047744 suppresses the metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by regulating the miR-21/SOCS5 axis,"There is increasing evidence that circular RNAs (circRNAs) can serve as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate metastasis of multiple tumors, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the role of the circRNA/miRNA regulatory network in metastasis of PDAC has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of circ_0047744/miR-21/SOCS5 in the metastasis of PDAC. We found that circRNA_0047744 was weakly expressed in PDAC tissues and cell lines. The expression of circ_0047744 was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis and positively correlated with overall survival in PDAC patients. Functionally, the overexpression of circ_0047744 suppressed cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circ_0047744 could regulate SOCS5 expression by acting as a sponge of miR-21 to inhibit migration and invasion of PDAC cells. Our study demonstrates that circ_0047744 acts as an anti-oncogene to inhibit PDAC metastasis by regulating the miR-21/SOCS5 axis, indicating that circ_0047744 may be a potential novel therapeutic target for PDAC patients.",-1
Validation of Machine Learning Models to Predict Adverse Outcomes in Patients with COVID-19: A Prospective Pilot Study,"Purpose:                    We previously developed learning models for predicting the need for intensive care and oxygen among patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Here, we aimed to prospectively validate the accuracy of these models.              Materials and methods:                    Probabilities of the need for intensive care [intensive care unit (ICU) score] and oxygen (oxygen score) were calculated from information provided by hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=44) via a web-based application. The performance of baseline scores to predict 30-day outcomes was assessed.              Results:                    Among 44 patients, 5 and 15 patients needed intensive care and oxygen, respectively. The area under the curve of ICU score and oxygen score to predict 30-day outcomes were 0.774 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.614-0.934] and 0.728 (95% CI: 0.559-0.898), respectively. The ICU scores of patients needing intensive care increased daily by 0.71 points (95% CI: 0.20-1.22) after hospitalization and by 0.85 points (95% CI: 0.36-1.35) after symptom onset, which were significantly different from those in individuals not needing intensive care (p=0.002 and <0.001, respectively). Trends in daily oxygen scores overall were not markedly different; however, when the scores were evaluated within <7 days after symptom onset, the patients needing oxygen showed a higher daily increase in oxygen scores [1.81 (95% CI: 0.48-3.14) vs. -0.28 (95% CI: 1.00-0.43), p=0.007].              Conclusion:                    Our machine learning models showed good performance for predicting the outcomes of COVID-19 patients and could thus be useful for patient triage and monitoring.",-1
Fish oil supplementation during adolescence attenuates metabolic programming of perinatal maternal high-fat diet in adult offspring,"Perinatal maternal high-fat diet (HFD) increases susceptibility to obesity and fatty liver diseases in adult offspring, which can be attenuated by the potent hypolipidaemic action of fish oil (FO), an n-3 PUFA source, during adult life. Previously, we described that adolescent HFD offspring showed resistance to FO hypolipidaemic effects, although FO promoted hepatic molecular changes suggestive of reduced lipid accumulation. Here, we investigated whether this FO intervention only during the adolescence period could affect offspring metabolism in adulthood. Then, female Wistar rats received isoenergetic, standard (STD: 9 % fat) or high-fat (HFD: 28Â·6 % fat) diet before mating, and throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, male offspring received the standard diet; and from 25 to 45 d old they received oral administration of soyabean oil or FO. At 150 d old, serum and hepatic metabolic parameters were evaluated. Maternal HFD adult offspring showed increased body weight, visceral adiposity, hyperleptinaemia and decreased hepatic pSTAT3/STAT3 ratio, suggestive of hepatic leptin resistance. FO intake only during the adolescence period reduced visceral adiposity and serum leptin, regardless of maternal diet. Maternal HFD promoted dyslipidaemia and hepatic TAG accumulation, which was correlated with reduced hepatic carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1a content, suggesting lipid oxidation impairment. FO intake did not change serum lipids; however, it restored hepatic TAG content and hepatic markers of lipid oxidation to STD offspring levels. Therefore, we concluded that FO intake exclusively during adolescence programmed STD offspring and reprogrammed HFD offspring male rats to a healthier metabolic phenotype in adult life, reducing visceral adiposity, serum leptin and hepatic TAG content in offspring adulthood.",-1
Additional Feeding Reveals Differences in Immune Recognition and Growth of Plasmodium Parasites in the Mosquito Host,"Mosquitoes may feed multiple times during their life span in addition to those times needed to acquire and transmit malaria. To determine the impact of subsequent blood feeding on parasite development in Anopheles gambiae, we examined Plasmodium parasite infection with or without an additional noninfected blood meal. We found that an additional blood meal significantly reduced Plasmodium berghei immature oocyst numbers, yet had no effect on the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum These observations were reproduced when mosquitoes were fed an artificial protein meal, suggesting that parasite losses are independent of blood ingestion. We found that feeding with either a blood or protein meal compromises midgut basal lamina integrity as a result of the physical distention of the midgut, enabling the recognition and lysis of immature P. berghei oocysts by mosquito complement. Moreover, we demonstrate that additional feeding promotes P. falciparum oocyst growth, suggesting that human malaria parasites exploit host resources provided with blood feeding to accelerate their growth. This is in contrast to experiments with P. berghei, where the size of surviving oocysts is independent of an additional blood meal. Together, these data demonstrate distinct differences in Plasmodium species in evading immune detection and utilizing host resources at the oocyst stage, representing an additional, yet unexplored component of vectorial capacity that has important implications for the transmission of malaria.IMPORTANCE Mosquitoes must blood feed multiple times to acquire and transmit malaria. However, the impact of an additional mosquito blood meal following malaria parasite infection has not been closely examined. Here, we demonstrate that additional feeding affects mosquito vector competence; namely, additional feeding significantly limits Plasmodium berghei infection, yet has no effect on infection of the human parasite P. falciparum Our experiments support that these killing responses are mediated by the physical distension of the midgut and by temporary damage to the midgut basal lamina that exposes immature P. berghei oocysts to mosquito complement, while human malaria parasites are able to evade these killing mechanisms. In addition, we provide evidence that additional feeding promotes P. falciparum oocyst growth. This is in contrast to P. berghei, where oocyst size is independent of an additional blood meal. This suggests that human malaria parasites are able to exploit host resources provided by an additional feeding to accelerate their growth. In summary, our data highlight distinct differences in malaria parasite species in evading immune recognition and adapting to mosquito blood feeding. These observations have important, yet previously unexplored, implications for the impact of multiple blood meals on the transmission of malaria.",-1
Dense Convolutional Network and Its Application in Medical Image Analysis,"Dense convolutional network (DenseNet) is a hot topic in deep learning research in recent years, which has good applications in medical image analysis. In this paper, DenseNet is summarized from the following aspects. First, the basic principle of DenseNet is introduced; second, the development of DenseNet is summarized and analyzed from five aspects: broaden DenseNet structure, lightweight DenseNet structure, dense unit, dense connection mode, and attention mechanism; finally, the application research of DenseNet in the field of medical image analysis is summarized from three aspects: pattern recognition, image segmentation, and object detection. The network structures of DenseNet are systematically summarized in this paper, which has certain positive significance for the research and development of DenseNet.",-1
Comprehensive Comparison of Novel Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) Integration Sites between B-Cell Lymphoma Lines BLSC-KU1 and BLSC-KU17 Using the Viral DNA Capture High-Throughput Sequencing Method,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infects cattle and integrates into host DNA, causing enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), an aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Here, we developed a novel proviral DNA-capture sequencing (proviral DNA-capture-seq) method investigating BLV proviral integration in two B-cell lymphoma lines, BLSC-KU1 and BLSC-KU17, derived from BLV-infected cattle with EBL. We designed BLV-specific biotinylated probes to capture the provirus genome and enrich libraries for next-generation sequencing. Validation showed high specificity and efficient enrichment of target sequence reads as well as identification of three BLV proviral integration sites on BLV persistently infected FLK-BLV cells as a positive control. We successfully detected a single BLV proviral integration site on chromosome 19 of BLSC-KU1 and chromosome 9 of BLSC-KU17, which were confirmed by standard PCR and Sanger sequencing. Further, a defective provirus in BLSC-KU1 and complete BLV proviral sequence in BLSC-KU17 were confirmed using long PCR and sequencing. This is the first study to provide comprehensive information on BLV proviral structure and viral integration in BLSC-KU1 and BLSC-KU17. Moreover, the proposed method can facilitate understanding of the detailed mechanisms underlying BLV-induced leukemogenesis and may be used as an innovative tool to screen BLV-infected cattle at risk at an earlier stage than those that have already developed lymphoma.",-1
Metagenomic shotgun sequencing reveals host species as an important driver of virome composition in mosquitoes,"High-throughput nucleic acid sequencing has greatly accelerated the discovery of viruses in the environment. Mosquitoes, because of their public health importance, are among those organisms whose viromes are being intensively characterized. Despite the deluge of sequence information, our understanding of the major drivers influencing the ecology of mosquito viromes remains limited. Using methods to increase the relative proportion of microbial RNA coupled with RNA-seq we characterize RNA viruses and other symbionts of three mosquito species collected along a rural to urban habitat gradient in Thailand. The full factorial study design allows us to explicitly investigate the relative importance of host species and habitat in structuring viral communities. We found that the pattern of virus presence was defined primarily by host species rather than by geographic locations or habitats. Our result suggests that insect-associated viruses display relatively narrow host ranges but are capable of spreading through a mosquito population at the geographical scale of our study. We also detected various single-celled and multicellular microorganisms such as bacteria, alveolates, fungi, and nematodes. Our study emphasizes the importance of including ecological information in viromic studies in order to gain further insights into viral ecology in systems where host specificity is driving both viral ecology and evolution.",-1
Using Demand Curves to Quantify the Reinforcing Value of Social and Solitary Drinking,"Background:                    Young adults typically drink in social settings and report high levels of episodic heavy drinking despite a range of adverse consequences. Behavioral economics posits that this may reflect a reinforcer pathology in which alcohol is overvalued relative to other reinforcers. Theoretically, the value of alcohol is related to both the direct pharmacological effects of alcohol (euphoria, sedation) and the associated social reinforcement, but to date no studies have differentiated the value of social vs. solitary drinking. The current study examines two modified hypothetical alcohol purchase tasks (APTs), one explicitly social and one explicitly solitary, in order to quantify the reward value of social vs. solitary drinking and to determine whether there are unique clinical correlates of solitary alcohol demand.              Methods:                    Participants were young adults (N = 274, Mage = 25.15, SD = 4.10) recruited from Mturk and from a university subject pool. Participants completed a solitary and social APT, in addition to measures of alcohol consumption and problems.              Results:                    Participants reported significantly greater demand in the social APT compared to the solitary APT across all demand indices. Elevated solitary and social demand were associated with elevated levels of alcohol use and problems. Using a residualized change approach, solitary demand amplitude (maximum consumption and expenditure) and persistence (price sensitivity) contributed additional variance above and beyond their social APT composite counterparts in predicting typical drinks per week and the self-care, academic/occupational, and physical dependence subscales of the YAACQ.              Conclusions:                    The presence of peers increases alcohol demand compared to a solitary scenario, and greater relative solitary drinking demand may be a risk factor for greater alcohol consumption and problems.",-1
Reply to 'Impulse control disorders are associated with lower ventral striatum dopamine D3 receptor availability in Parkinson's disease: A [11C]-PHNO PET study.',"Pagano and collaborators have recently reported lower ventral striatum D3 receptor availability in Parkinson's disease using PET scan. Our group conducted the first postmortem study of individuals with PD who had ICD and related behaviours in life and reported lower alpha-synuclein pathology and D3R levels in the nucleus accumbens of such individuals. The findings by Pagano and co-authors of low D3R binding in PD patients at baseline, when taken together with our findings of lower Lewy pathology and D3R in the nucleus accumbens, favour the hypothesis that D3R levels are downregulated because of excessive synaptic dopamine.",-1
Biotoxicity Evaluation of a Cationic Star Polymer on a Predatory Ladybird and Cooperative Pest Control by Polymer-Delivered Pesticides and Ladybird,"Although employing nanocarriers for gene/drug delivery shows great potential in agricultural fields, the biotoxicity of nanocarriers is a major concern for large-scale applications. Herein, we synthesized a cationic star polymer (SPc) as a pesticide nanocarrier/adjuvant to evaluate its safety against a widely used predatory ladybird (Harmonia axyridis). The application of SPc at extremely high concentrations nearly did not influence the hatching of ladybird eggs but it led to the death of ladybird larvae at lethal concentration 50 (LC50) values of 43.96 and 19.85 mg/mL through the soaking and feeding methods, respectively. The oral feeding of SPc downregulated many membrane protein genes and lysosome genes significantly, and the cell membrane and nucleus in gut tissues were remarkably damaged by SPc application, revealing that the lethal mechanism might be SPc-mediated membrane damage. Furthermore, the oral feeding of SPc increased the relative abundance of Serratia bacteria in ladybird guts to result in bacterial infection. Coapplication of ladybird and SPc-loaded thiamethoxam/matrine achieved desired control efficacies of more than 80% against green peach aphids, revealing that the coapplication could overcome the slow-acting property of ladybirds. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the polymer-mediated lethal mechanism toward natural enemies and explore the possibility of coapplying SPc-loaded pesticides and natural enemies for pest management.",-1
Reduction in the Dietary VA Status Prevents Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity in Zucker Diabetic Fatty Rats,"We hypothesized that the vitamin A (VA) status regulates type 2 diabetes (T2D) development in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Zucker Lean and ZDF rats at weaning were fed a VA deficient with basal fat (VAD-BF, no VA and 22.1% fat energy), VA marginal with BF (VAM-BF, 0.35 mg retinyl palmitate (RP)/kg), VA sufficient with BF (VAS-BF, 4.0 mg RP/kg), VAD with high fat (VAD-HF, 60% fat energy), VAM-HF or VAS-HF diet for 8 weeks, including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at week 7.5. The hepatic mRNA and proteins levels were determined using real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The VAD-BF/HF and VAM-BF/HF diets prevented peripheral hyperglycemia and attenuated obesity in ZDF rats, which occurred in the presence of the VAS-BF/HF diets. This lowered VA status reduced venous blood hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia, and improved OGTT and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance results in ZDF rats. The expression levels of key hepatic genes for glucose and fat metabolism were regulated by VA status and dietary fat contents. An interaction between VA and HF condition was also observed. We conclude that the reduction in the dietary VA status in both BF and HF conditions prevents T2D and obesity in ZDF rats.",-1
(20R)-Panaxadiol as a Natural Active Component with Anti-Obesity Effects on ob/ob Mice via Modulating the Gut Microbiota,"Obesity is an important cause of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver and atherosclerosis. The use of ingredients extracted from traditional Chinese medicine for weight loss is now receiving more and more attention. Ginseng has been recorded since ancient times for the treatment of diabetes. The (20R)-Panaxadiol (PD) belongs to the ginseng diol type compounds, which are moderately bioavailable and may remain in the intestinal tract for a longer period of time. This study investigated the potential positive effect of PD in ob/ob mice and evaluated its effect against obesity. The ob/ob mice were administered PD for ten weeks. Our study showed that PD could improve obesity, glucose tolerance disorder, as well as gut dysbiosis. Panaxadiol decreased ob/ob mice's Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B). Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the fecal microbiota suggested that PD changed the composition of the gut microbiota in ob/ob mice and modulated specific bacteria such as lactobacillus, prevotellace and so on. Moreover, PD improved the intestinal wall integrity. In conclusion, our results suggest that (20R)-Panaxadiol, as an active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb ginseng, may improve obesity to some extent via improving gut microbiota.",-1
Palmitoylation in Crohn's disease: Current status and future directions,"S-palmitoylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications in nature; however, its importance has been overlooked for decades. Crohn's disease (CD), a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation involving the entire gastrointestinal tract. Bowel damage and subsequent disabilities caused by CD are a growing global health issue. Well-acknowledged risk factors for CD include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, such as a westernized lifestyle, and altered gut microbiota. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of this disorder are not yet comprehensively understood. With the rapidly increasing global prevalence of CD and the evident role of S-palmitoylation in CD, as recently reported, there is a need to investigate the relationship between CD and S-palmitoylation. In this review, we summarize the concept, detection, and function of S-palmitoylation as well as its potential effects on CD, and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of CD.",-1
Combination of Blockchain and AI for Music Intellectual Property Protection,"In the last two years, due to the pandemic and restrictive measures, the dependence of music creators and artists on the Internet, where they could promote their work, organize live streaming concerts, and talk to the public, has increased and expanded even more and seeks higher revenue from digital music platforms.

The imposition of legal and commercial conditions on its movement cannot be associated with any restrictions on the free movement of information, as it is not related to them. In general, the unauthorized exchange of digital music files via peer-to-peer violates copyright law. The exchange of files is unauthorized, as it does not have the relevant permission from the creators and beneficiaries and is therefore illegal. With this in mind, this paper proposes a highly effective way of protecting the copyright of music technology, which is based on the widespread use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cryptography technologies. Specifically, an advanced blockchain model based on Hyperledger Fabric is introduced, which, however, uses Quantum Homomorphic Encryption and Quantum Zero-Knowledge Arguments. Music files are implemented as Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs), which activate smart contracts. Finally, an advanced collaborative filtering algorithm provides recommendations for effectiveness in securing the copyrights of music industry creators. A specialized scenario was built to model the proposed system to verify the degree of protection on music intellectual property in developing a security simulation with an innovative consensus-based zero knowledge and the quantum fully homomorphic encryption technique. Experiment results show that this technique can aid in implementing a technologically aware system capable of providing a powerful answer to a current real-world problem.",-1
Neuroprotective Effects of B-Type Cinnamon Procyanidin Oligomers on MPP +-Induced Apoptosis in a Cell Culture Model of Parkinson's Disease,"Cinnamon procyanidin oligomers (CPOs) are water-soluble components extracted from cinnamon. This study aims to explore the neuroprotection of B-type CPO (CPO-B) against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-mediated cytotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms underlying its protection. The results demonstrated that CPO-B showed protection by increasing cell viability, attenuating an intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, downregulating cleaved caspase-3 expression, and upregulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Moreover, CPO-B completely blocked the dephosphorylation of extracellular, signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk1/2) caused by MPP+. Treatment with an Erk1/2 inhibitor, SCH772984, significantly abolished the neuroprotection of CPO-B against MPP+. Taken together, we demonstrate that CPO-B from cinnamon bark provided protection against MPP+ in cultured SH-SY5Y cells, and the potential mechanisms may be attributed to its ability to modulate the dysregulation between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins through the Erk1/2 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that the addition of cinnamon to food or supplements might benefit patients with PD.",-1
NF-ÎºB-Induced R-Loops and Genomic Instability in HTLV-1-Infected and Adult T-Cell Leukemia Cells,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a human delta retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) in 3-5% of the infected population after decades of clinical latency. HTLV-1 Tax is a potent activator of IKK/NF-ÎºB and a clastogen. While NF-ÎºB activities are associated with cell survival and proliferation, constitutive NF-ÎºB activation (NF-ÎºB hyperactivation) by Tax leads to senescence and oncogenesis. Until recently, the mechanisms underlying the DNA damage and senescence induced by Tax and NF-ÎºB were unknown. Current data indicate that NF-ÎºB hyperactivation by Tax causes the accumulation of a nucleic acid structure known as an R-loop. R-loop excision by the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) endonucleases, Xeroderma pigmentosum F (XPF), and XPG, in turn, promotes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). NF-ÎºB blockade prevents Tax-induced R-loop accumulation, DNA damage, and senescence. In the same vein, the silencing of XPF and XPG mitigates Tax senescence, while deficiency in either or both frequently occurs in ATL of all types. ATL cells maintain constitutively active NF-ÎºB, accumulate R-loops, and resist Tax-induced senescence. These results suggest that ATL cells must have acquired adaptive changes to prevent senescence and benefit from the survival and proliferation advantages conferred by Tax and NF-ÎºB. In this review, the roles of R-loops in Tax- and NF-ÎºB-induced DNA DSBs, senescence, and ATL development, and the epigenetic and genetic alterations that arise in ATL to reduce R-loop-associated DNA damage and avert senescence will be discussed.",-1
Cryo-EM reveals a previously unrecognized structural protein of a dsRNA virus implicated in its extracellular transmission,"Mosquito viruses cause unpredictable outbreaks of disease. Recently, several unassigned viruses isolated from mosquitoes, including the Omono River virus (OmRV), were identified as totivirus-like viruses, with features similar to those of the Totiviridae family. Most reported members of this family infect fungi or protozoans and lack an extracellular life cycle stage. Here, we identified a new strain of OmRV and determined high-resolution structures for this virus using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structures feature an unexpected protrusion at the five-fold vertex of the capsid. Disassociation of the protrusion could result in several conformational changes in the major capsid. All these structures, together with some biological results, suggest the protrusions' associations with the extracellular transmission of OmRV.",-1
"Association Between Early Life Weight Gain and Abdominal Fat Partitioning at 4.5 Years is Sex, Ethnicity, and Age Dependent","Objective:                    The aim of this study was to investigate the independent associations between age-specific annual weight gain from birth to age 4 years and fat deposition in metabolically distinct compartments at age 4.5 years in a South Asian longitudinal birth cohort.              Methods:                    Volumetric abdominal magnetic resonance imaging with comprehensive segmentation of deep and superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissues (VAT) was performed in 316 children (150 boys and 166 girls in three ethnic groups; 158 Chinese, 94 Malay, and 64 Indian) aged 4.5 years. Associations between fat volumes and annual relative weight gain conditional on past growth were assessed overall and stratified by sex and ethnicity.              Results:                    Conditional relative weight gain had stronger associations with greater SAT and VAT at age 4.5 years in girls than boys and in Indians compared with Malay and Chinese. Overall, the magnitude of association was the largest during 2 to 3 years for SAT and 1 to 2 years for VAT. Despite similar body weight, Indian children and girls had the highest deep and superficial SAT volumes at age 4.5 years (all interactions P < 0.05). No significant sex or ethnic differences were observed in VAT. With increasing BMI, Indian children had the highest tendency to accumulate VAT, and girls accumulated more fat than boys in all depots (all interactions P < 0.001).              Conclusions:                    Indian ethnicity and female sex predisposed children to accumulate more fat in the VAT depot with increasing conditional relative weight gain in the second year of life. Thus, 1 to 2 years of age may be a critical window for interventions to reduce visceral fat accumulation.",-1
Regulatory miRNAs in Cardiovascular and Alzheimer's Disease: A Focus on Copper,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs), are key regulators of differentiation and development. In the cell, transcription factors regulate the production of miRNA in response to different external stimuli. Copper (Cu) is a heavy metal and an essential micronutrient with widespread industrial applications. It is involved in a number of vital biological processes encompassing respiration, blood cell line maturation, and immune responses. In recent years, the link between deregulation of miRNAs' functionality and the development of various pathologies as well as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has been extensively studied. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly with a complex disease etiology, and its link with Cu abnormalities is being increasingly studied. A direct interaction between COMMD1, a regulator of the Cu pathway, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) HIF-1a does exist in ischemic injury, but little information has been collected on the role of Cu in hypoxia associated with AD thus far. The current review deals with this matter in an attempt to structurally discuss the link between miRNA expression and Cu dysregulation in AD and CVDs.",-1
"Effects of Calcium Source, Inulin, and Lactose on Gut-Bone Associations in an Ovarierectomized Rat Model","Scope:                    Osteoporosis poses a health challenge especially for postmenopausal women. This study aims to explore nutritional strategies to counteract bone demineralization in ovarierectomized (OVX) rats.              Methods and results:                    OVX rats (n = 49) are fed with one of six different diets, where two different calcium sources (dairy calcium or calcium carbonate) are provided alone or in combination with either inulin (5%) or lactose (0.5%). In addition, a calcium-deficient diet is included. Calcium supplementation increases intestinal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the abundance of fecal Acinetobacter and Propionibacterium. Accompanied with these effects, rats fed with calcium-fortified diets have higher bone mineral density, bone mineral content and femur mechanical strength, lower serum levels of bone markers, and lower expression of calcium absorption-related genes (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 6 (TRPV6), calcium-binding protein (CaBP) compared with control. Inulin supplementation results in a markedly increased production of intestinal SCFAs, a decreased intestinal pH, an increased abundance of Allobaculum and Bifidobacterium, and an increased expression of Trpv6. Inulin and lactose show beneficial effects on spine bone.              Conclusion:                    Calcium modulates gut microbiome composition and function. A pronounced effect of inulin on metabolic activity in the gastrointestinal tract is evident, and lactose supplementation decreases jejunal pH that might be associated with slightly enhanced bone mineralization.",-1
The Significance of the Effect of Visceral Adiposity on Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in the General Population,"We evaluated the association between visceral adiposity and left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in association with plasma adiponectin levels in 213 subjects without overt cardiac diseases. Abdominal visceral fat area was quantified by computed tomography. Excessive visceral fat was significantly associated with impaired diastolic parameters including E/A, E' and E/E'. Although serum adiponectin levels decreased with increased visceral adiposity, there was no independent association between serum adiponectin levels and diastolic parameters, which suggest that the role of adiponectin in this association might be indirect.",-1
Rotavirus-Mediated Suppression of miRNA-192 Family and miRNA-181a Activates Wnt/Î²-Catenin Signaling Pathway: An In Vitro Study,"The significance of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling cascade in Rotavirus (RV) infection has not been elucidated. In this study, we attempt to elucidate the importance of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in the RV pathogenesis and investigate a miRNA-mediated approach to regulate the pathway to repress the RV infection in the host. The regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway in terms of Î²-catenin accumulation and activation was analyzed by Western blotting and Confocal imaging analysis. The expression levels of miR-192 family members and miR-181a were enquired into using qPCR assays, whereas their targets in the Wnt pathway were confirmed using the Luciferase Reporter Assays. Members of the miR-192 family and miR-181a, which target the components of the pathway, were also found to be considerably decreased in expression during RV infection. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs could restrict the RV pathogenesis by targeting the intermediates of the Wnt signaling pathway. The miR-192 family and miR-181a were capable of suppressing the RV infection via targeting of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. The study not only highlights the role of the Wnt signaling cascade in RV infection but also suggests that miRNAs can synergistically decrease RV replication by a significant amount. Thus, the miR-192 family and miR-181a present themselves as prospective antivirals against RV infection.",-1
"Oral Intake of Chicken Bone Collagen Peptides Anti-Skin Aging in Mice by Regulating Collagen Degradation and Synthesis, Inhibiting Inflammation and Activating Lysosomes","The effect of diet on skin aging has become an interesting research topic. Previous studies have mostly focused on the beneficial effects of collagen peptides derived from marine organisms on the aging skin when administered orally, while the beneficial effects of collagen peptides derived from poultry on aging skin have been rarely reported. In this study, collagen peptides were prepared from chicken bone by enzymatic hydrolysis, and the effect and mechanism of action of orally administered collagen peptides on alleviating skin aging induced by UV combined with D-galactose were investigated. The results showed that the chicken bone collagen had typical characteristics of collagen, and the chicken bone collagen peptides (CPs) were mainly small molecular peptides with a molecular weight of &lt;3000 Da. In vivo experiments showed that CPs had a significant relieving effect on aging skin, indicated by the changes in the compostion and structure of the aging skin, improvement of skin antioxidant level, and inhibition of inflammation; the relieving effect was positively correlated with the dose of CPs. Further investigation showed that CPs first reduce the level of skin oxidation, inhibit the expression of the key transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos), then activate the TGF-Î²/Smad signaling pathway to promote collagen synthesis, inhibit the expression of MMP-1/3 to inhibit collagen degradation, and inhibit skin inflammation to alleviate skin aging in mice. Moreover, the skin transcriptome found that lysosomes activated after oral administration of CPs may be an important pathway for CPs in anti-skin aging, and is worthy of further research. These results suggested that CPs might be used as a functional anti-aging nutritional component.",-1
"Modeling of energy consumption factors for an industrial cement vertical roller mill by SHAP-XGBoost: a ""conscious lab"" approach","Cement production is one of the most energy-intensive manufacturing industries, and the milling circuit of cement plants consumes around 4% of a year's global electrical energy production. It is well understood that modeling and digitalizing industrial-scale processes would help control production circuits better, improve efficiency, enhance personal training systems, and decrease plants' energy consumption. This tactical approach could be integrated using conscious lab (CL) as an innovative concept in the internet age. Surprisingly, no CL has been reported for the milling circuit of a cement plant. A robust CL interconnect datasets originated from monitoring operational variables in the plants and translating them to human basis information using explainable artificial intelligence (EAI) models. By initiating a CL for an industrial cement vertical roller mill (VRM), this study conducted a novel strategy to explore relationships between VRM monitored operational variables and their representative energy consumption factors (output temperature and motor power). Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as one of the most recent EAI models accurately helped fill the lack of information about correlations within VRM variables. SHAP analyses highlighted that working pressure and input gas rate with positive relationships are the key factors influencing energy consumption. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as a powerful predictive tool could accurately model energy representative factors by R-square ever 0.80 in the testing phase. Comparison assessments indicated that SHAP-XGBoost could provide higher accuracy for VRM-CL structure than conventional modeling tools (Pearson correlation, Random Forest, and Support vector regression.",-1
Anthropometric Obesity Indices were Stronger than CT-Based Indices in Associations with Carotid Intima-Media Thickness in Japanese Men,"Aim:                    Computed tomography (CT) can directly provide information on body compositions and distributions, compared to anthropometric indices. It has been shown that various obesity indices are associated with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). However, whether CT-based obesity indices are stronger than anthropometric indices in association with atherosclerosis remains to be determined in a general population.              Methods:                    We cross-sectionally assessed carotid IMT using ultrasound in 944 community-dwelling Japanese men free of stroke and myocardial infarction. CT image at the L4-L5 level was obtained to compute areas of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Anthropometric measures assessed included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. Using multivariable linear regression, slopes of IMT per 20th to 80th percentile of each index were compared. We also compared the slope of index with simultaneous adjustment for BMI in the same model.              Results:                    Areas of VAT and SAT were positively associated with IMT, but not stronger than those of anthropometric indices in point estimates. Among all obesity indices, BMI was strongest in association with IMT after adjusting for age and lifestyle factors or further adjusting for metabolic factors. In simultaneous adjustment models, BMI, but not CT-based indices, remained significant and showed the strongest association.              Conclusions:                    In community-dwelling Japanese men, anthropometric obesity indices, BMI in particular, were more strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis than CT-based obesity indices. The association of general obesity with carotid atherosclerosis was strong and adding CT-based obesity measure did not considerably influence in the association.",-1
Circular RNA dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase facilitated triple-negative breast cancer progression via miR-362-3p/DDX5 axis,"Background:                    Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a common hypotype of breast cancer. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are burgeoning serve as vital controllers in numerous tumors. Nevertheless, the expression and regulatory mode of circRNAs in TNBC are still indistinct. This paper aimed to reveal the function and molecular mechanism of circular RNA dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase (circDHDDS) in TNBC.              Methods:                    The contents of circDHDDS, DHDDS mRNA, microRNA-362-3p (miR-362-3p) and DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 5 (DDX5) were indicated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot. The colony formation assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay were executed to assess cell proliferation. The flow cytometry assay was utilized to detect cell apoptosis. The transwell assay and tube formation assay were applied to measure cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. The targeted relationships of miR-362-3p and circDHDDS or DDX5 were forecasted and detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The in vivo test was implemented to confirm the effect of circDHDDS.              Results:                    The contents of circDHDDS and DDX5 were increased, and miR-362-3p level was decreased in TNBC. CircDHDDS deficiency reserved cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis, while facilitated cell apoptosis in TNBC cells. Furthermore, miR-362-3p was validated to exert a tumor repressive effect in TNBC cells by suppressing DDX5. Moreover, DDX5 could regulate the development of TNBC. The experimental data exposed that levels of miR-362-3p presented noteworthy negative correlation with circDHDDS and DDX5, while circDHDDS and DDX5 exhibited significant positive correlation. In mechanism, circDHDDS bound to miR-362-3p to modulate DDX5 expression. In addition, circDHDDS knock-down also attenuated tumor growth.              Conclusion:                    CircDHDDS expedited TNBC by swelling DDX5 via adapting miR-362-3p.",-1
Altered In Vivo Lipid Fluxes and Cell Dynamics in Subcutaneous Adipose Tissues Are Associated With the Unfavorable Pattern of Fat Distribution in Obese Adolescent Girls,"Patterns of abdominal fat distribution (for example, a high vs. low visceral adipose tissue [VAT]/[VAT + subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)] ratio), independent of obesity, during adolescence carry a high risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of obese adolescents has recently revealed that a high ratio (high VAT/[VAT + SAT]) is a major determinant of fatty liver and metabolic impairment over time, with these effects being more pronounced in girls than in boys. To unravel the underlying metabolic alterations associated with the unfavorable VAT/(VAT + SAT) phenotype, we used the 2H2O labeling method to measure the turnover of adipose lipids and cells in the subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal/femoral adipose tissue (SAT) of weight-stable obese adolescent girls with a similar level of obesity but discordant VAT/(VAT + SAT) ratios. Girls with the unfavorable (high VAT/[VAT + SAT]) phenotype exhibited higher in vivo rates of triglyceride (TG) turnover (representing both lipolysis and synthesis at steady state), without significant differences in de novo lipogenesis in both abdominal and gluteal depots, compared with obese girls with the favorable phenotype. Moreover, mature adipocytes had higher turnover, with no difference in stromal vascular cell proliferation in both depots in the metabolically unfavorable phenotype. The higher TG turnover rates were significantly correlated with higher intrahepatic fat stores. These findings are contrary to the hypothesis that impaired capacity to deposit TGs or proliferation of new mature adipocytes are potential mechanisms for ectopic fat distribution in this setting. In summary, these results suggest that increased turnover of TGs (lipolysis) and of mature adipocytes in both abdominal and gluteal SAT may contribute to metabolic impairment and the development of fatty liver, even at this very early stage of disease.",-1
Resveratrol Decreases the Invasion Potential of Gastric Cancer Cells,"The cancer-preventive agent Resveratrol (RSV) [3,5,4'-trihydroxytrans-stilbene] is a widely recognized antioxidant molecule with antitumoral potential against several types of cancers, including prostate, hepatic, breast, skin, colorectal, and pancreatic. Herein, we studied the effect of RSV on the cell viability and invasion potential of gastric cancer cells. AGS and MKN45 cells were treated with different doses of RSV (0-200 Î¼M) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using the Sulphorhodamine B dye (SRB) assay. For invasion assays, gastric cells were pre-treated with RSV (5-25 Î¼M) for 24 h and then seeded in a Transwell chamber with coating Matrigel. The results obtained showed that RSV inhibited invasion potential in both cell lines. Moreover, to elucidate the mechanism implicated in this process, we analyzed the effects of RSV on SOD, heparanase, and NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity. The results indicated that RSV increased SOD activity in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, RSV significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity of NF-ÎºB and the enzymatic activity of heparanase in similar conditions, which was determined using ELISA-like assays. In summary, these results show that RSV increases SOD activity but decreases NF-kB transcriptional activity and heparanase enzymatic activity, which correlates with the attenuation of invasion potential in gastric cancer cells. To our knowledge, no previous study has described the effect of RSV on heparanase activity. This article proposes that heparanase could be a key effector in the invasive events occurring during gastric cancer metastasis.",-1
Improved Deep Neural Network for Cross-Media Visual Communication,"Cross-media visual communication is an extremely complex task. In order to solve the problem of segmentation of visual foreground and background, improve the accuracy of visual communication scene reconstruction, and complete the task of visual real-time communication. We propose an improved generative adversarial network. We take the generative adversarial network as the basis and add a combined codec package to the generator, while configuring the generator and discriminator as a cascade structure, preserving the feature upsampling and downsampling convolutional layers of visual scenes with different layers through correspondence. To classify features with different visual scene layers, we add a new auxiliary classifier based on convolutional neural networks. With the help of the auxiliary classifier, similar visual scenes with different feature layers have a more accurate recognition rate. In the experimental part, to better distinguish foreground and background in visual communication, we perform performance tests on foreground and background using separate datasets. The experimental results show that our method has good accuracy in both foreground and background in cross-media communication for real-time visual communication. In addition, we validate the efficiency of our method on Cityscapes, NoW, and Replica datasets, respectively, and experimentally demonstrate that our method performs better than traditional machine learning methods and outperforms deep learning methods of the same type.",-1
Epithelioid Pleural Mesothelioma Is Characterized by Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Long Survivors: Results from the MATCH Study,"Pleural mesothelioma (PM) is an aggressive tumor with few therapeutic options. Although patients with epithelioid PM (ePM) survive longer than non-epithelioid PM (non-ePM), heterogeneity of tumor response in ePM is observed. The role of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in the development and progression of PM is currently considered a promising biomarker. A few studies have used high-throughput technologies correlated with TIME evaluation and morphologic and clinical data. This study aimed to identify different morphological, immunohistochemical, and transcriptional profiles that could potentially predict the outcome. A retrospective multicenter cohort of 129 chemonaive PM patients was recruited. Tissue slides were reviewed by dedicated pathologists for histotype classification and immunophenotype of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and lymphoid aggregates or tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). ePM (n = 99) survivors were further classified into long (&gt;36 months) or short (&lt;12 months) survivors. RNAseq was performed on a subset of 69 samples. Distinct transcriptional profiling in long and short ePM survivors was found. An inflammatory background with a higher number of B lymphocytes and a prevalence of TLS formations were detected in long compared to short ePM survivors. These results suggest that B cell infiltration could be important in modulating disease aggressiveness, opening a pathway for novel immunotherapeutic approaches.",-1
Visual Identification of Mobile App GUI Elements for Automated Robotic Testing,"Automated robotic testing is an emerging testing approach for mobile apps that can afford complete black-box testing. Compared with other automated testing approaches, automatic robotic testing can reduce the dependence on the internal information of apps. However, capturing GUI element information accurately and effectively from a black-box perspective is a critical issue in robotic testing. This study introduces object detection technology to achieve the visual identification of mobile app GUI elements. First, we consider the requirements of test implementation, the feasibility of visual identification, and the external image features of GUI comprehensively to complete the reasonable classification of GUI elements. Subsequently, we constructed and optimized an object detection dataset for the mobile app GUI. Finally, we implement the identification of GUI elements based on the YOLOv3 model and evaluate the effectiveness of the results. This work can serve as the basis for vision-driven robotic testing for mobile apps and presents a universal approach that is not restricted by platforms to identify mobile app GUI elements.",-1
Adipose-Derived Stem Cells-Derived Exosomes with High Amounts of Circ_0001747 Alleviate Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-Induced Injury in Myocardial Cells by Targeting MiR-199b-3p/MCL1 Axis,"Recent studies demonstrated that circular RNAs play important roles in exosome-mediated cardio-protective effects after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A previous study reported that circ_0001747 level is down-regulated in mouse hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model. However, its biological role and working mechanism in AMI remain largely unknown.Exosomes were isolated from the culture supernatant of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) using an ExoQuick precipitation kit. We treated mouse myocardial cells HL-1 with H/R to explore the role of exosomal circ_0001747 in AMI pathology. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation were analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were conducted to confirm the interaction between microRNA-199b-3p (miR-199b-3p) and circ_0001747 or MCL1 apoptosis regulator, BCL2 family member (MCL1).H/R-induced HL-1 dysfunction was attenuated by the incubation of exosomes derived from ADSCs, especially the exosomes with high amounts of circ_0001747. Circ_0001747 directly targeted miR-199b-3p in HL-1 cells. miR-199b-3p overexpression partly overturned exosomal circ_0001747-mediated protective effects in H/R-induced HL-1 cells. MCL1 was a direct target of miR-199b-3p in HL-1 cells. miR-199b-3p silencing alleviated H/R-induced damage in HL-1 cells partly by up-regulating MCL1. Circ_0001747 can elevate the messenger RNA and protein levels of MCL1 by sequestering miR-199b-3p.Overall, these results indicated that ADSCs-derived exosomes with high amounts of circ_0001747 attenuated H/R-induced HL-1 dysfunction partly by targeting miR-199b-3p/MCL1 signaling.",-1
Lifestyle changes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"Background:                    Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 8% to 13% of reproductive-aged women and is associated with reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. Obesity worsens the presentation of PCOS and weight management (weight loss, maintenance or prevention of excess weight gain) is proposed as an initial treatment strategy, best achieved through lifestyle changes incorporating diet, exercise and behavioural interventions.              Objectives:                    To assess the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment in improving reproductive, anthropometric (weight and body composition), metabolic and quality of life factors in PCOS.              Search methods:                    We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED (date of last search March 2018). We also searched controlled trials registries, conference abstracts, relevant journals, reference lists of relevant papers and reviews, and grey literature databases, with no language restrictions applied.              Selection criteria:                    Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lifestyle treatment (diet, exercise, behavioural or combined treatments) to minimal or no treatment in women with PCOS.              Data collection and analysis:                    Two authors independently selected trials, assessed evidence quality and risk of bias, and extracted data. Our primary outcomes were live birth, miscarriage and pregnancy. We used inverse variance and fixed-effect models in the meta-analyses. We reported dichotomous outcomes as an odds ratio and continuous outcomes as a mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD).              Main results:                    We included 15 studies with 498 participants. Ten studies compared physical activity to minimal dietary and behavioural intervention or no intervention. Five studies compared combined dietary, exercise and behavioural intervention to minimal intervention. One study compared behavioural intervention to minimal intervention. Risk of bias varied: eight studies had adequate sequence generation, seven had adequate clinician or outcome assessor blinding, seven had adequate allocation concealment, six had complete outcome data and six were free of selective reporting. No studies assessed the fertility primary outcomes of live birth or miscarriage. No studies reported the secondary reproductive outcome of menstrual regularity, as defined in this review.Lifestyle intervention may improve a secondary (endocrine) reproductive outcome, the free androgen index (FAI) (MD -1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.96 to -0.26, 6 RCTs, N = 204, I2 = 71%, low-quality evidence). Lifestyle intervention may reduce weight (kg) (MD -1.68 kg, 95% CI -2.66 to -0.70, 9 RCTs, N = 353, I2 = 47%, low-quality evidence). Lifestyle intervention may reduce body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (-0.34 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.01, 12 RCTs, N = 434, I2= 0%, low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of lifestyle intervention on glucose tolerance (glucose outcomes in oral glucose tolerance test) (mmol/L/minute) (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.33, 3 RCTs, N = 121, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence).              Authors' conclusions:                    Lifestyle intervention may improve the free androgen index (FAI), weight and BMI in women with PCOS. We are uncertain of the effect of lifestyle intervention on glucose tolerance. There were no studies that looked at the effect of lifestyle intervention on live birth, miscarriage or menstrual regularity. Most studies in this review were of low quality mainly due to high or unclear risk of bias across most domains and high heterogeneity for the FAI outcome.",-1
The role of MRI in the diagnosis and management of tracheal diverticulum,"Background:                    Multidetector CT is currently the best imaging method for detecting tracheal diverticulum (TD). Compared with CT, MRI is radiation-free and has higher resolution. However, the MRI characteristics of this disease have not been previously reported. The present retrospective study compared the MR and CT imaging features of TD, aiming to examine the role of MRI in TD diagnosis and management.              Methods:                    Imaging data were collected in 26 TD patients divided into two groups, including the uninfected and infected groups. The MR and CT imaging features (size/wall/channel) of uninfected patients were compared. The performances of MRI and CT in diagnosing and monitoring therapeutic efficacy in infected TD patients were comparatively assessed.              Results:                    The uninfected group comprised 25 cases with 25 lesions confirmed by CT, including 23 lesions (92%) detected by MRI, with an average diameter of 8.5 mm (range from 3 to 15 mm). Meanwhile, the average diameter was 7.8 mm as measured by CT (range from 2.8 mm to 14.7 mm). The lesion diameters of the two cases not detected by MRI were 2.3 mm and 2 mm. MRI detected walls of all the 23 lesions (23/23), while CT detected no wall (0/23). CT showed channels in 18 lesions (18/23) versus3 for MRI (3/23). The infected case presented with a paratracheal abscess; MRI clearly showed a relationship between the abscess and the trachea, while CT could not show the lesion source. MRI also sensitively showed the whole process of lesion absorption.              Conclusions:                    MRI can be used as a supplementary method for TD diagnosis, providing information about the wall that cannot be obtained by CT. MRI is superior to CT in diagnosing infected TD cases presenting with a paratracheal abscess, and in monitoring therapeutic efficacy in these patients.",-1
Distribution of Culex coronator in the USA,"In 1920, Culex coronator was reported from San Benito, Texas, and later in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. In 2005, this species was reported to be spreading across the southeastern USA. Now reported in 14 states, it has been found as far north as northern Oklahoma; Memphis, TN; and Suffolk, VA. The public health significance of Cx. coronator is not firmly established, even though it has been implicated as a potential vector of several arboviral diseases. This study aims to document additional Cx. coronator county-level records, to provide information about its continued expansion across the southern USA, and to provide a short research update into its vector potential. Data acquired through multistate collaborations and author collections resulted in 146 new county records from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. No new county records were presented for Arizona, New Mexico, Tennessee, or Virginia, which had previously reported this species. With these new data, this species has been documented in 386 counties in 14 states of the continental USA.",-1
The association of dietary carbohydrate with FTO gene expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of adults without diabetes,"Objectives:                    The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of dietary carbohydrates with fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) expression in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.              Methods:                    In this cross-sectional study, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues were gathered from 58 obese (body mass index â?0 kg/m2) and 44 non-obese (body mass index â?8 to<30 kg/m2) participants, aged â?0 y, who had undergone elective abdominal surgery with minimal effect on dietary intake. Dietary intake was collected using a valid and reliable food frequency questionnaire, and daily intake of total carbohydrates, total sugar, sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose, and maltose were calculated. The mRNA expression of the FTO gene in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.              Results:                    No significant difference was observed for FTO gene expression in subcutaneous and visceral fat mass between non-obese and obese participants. After adjusting for age and sex, total carbohydrate intake was inversely associated with FTO gene expression in subcutaneous (Î² = -0.403; P = 0.003) adipose tissues among obese participants. Furthermore, higher intake of total sugars, sucrose, glucose, and lactose was inversely and higher intake fructose was directly associated with FTO mRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue among participants with obesity.              Conclusion:                    Dietary intake of total sugars, sucrose, glucose, and lactose in obese participants only was inversely and dietary fructose was positively associated with FTO gene expression from the subcutaneous adipose tissue.",-1
Preliminary analysis of whether mosquitoes can carry and transmit African swine fever,"Background:                    Mosquitoes are important insect vectors, but whether they can carry and transmit African swine fever virus (ASFV) in large-scale pig farms in China is unknown.              Results:                    In this study, probe-based qPCR analysis was performed on mosquitoes from five pig farms with ASF virus (ASFV). Analysis of ASFV in 463 mosquitoes yielded negative cycle threshold (CT) value), and detection remained negative after mixing samples from all five pig farms.              Conclusions:                    Therefore, mosquitoes appear unlikely to transmit ASFV, and pose little threat to large-scale pig farms. Thus, farms should continue to follow normal mosquito control procedures when formulating strategies for the prevention and control of ASF.",-1
METTL3-mediated maturation of miR-589-5p promotes the malignant development of liver cancer,"MiR-589-5p could promote liver cancer, but the specific mechanisms are largely unknown. This study examined the role and mechanisms of miR-589-5p in liver cancer. The expressions of miR-589-5p, METTL3 and m6A in liver cancers were determined by RT-qPCR. The relationship between miR-589-5p and METTL3-mediated m6A methylation was examined by m6A RNA immunoprecipitation. After transfection, the viability, migration, invasion and expressions of METTL3 and miR-589-5p in liver cancer cells were detected by CCK-8, wound-healing, transwell and RT-qPCR. After the xenograft tumour was established in mice, the tumour volume was determined and the expressions of METTL3, miR-589-5p, MMP-2, TIMP-2, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin in tumour tissue were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. In vitro study showed that miR-589-5p and METTL3 were highly expressed in liver cancer. METTL3 was positively correlated with miR-589-5p. METTL3 up-regulated the expression of miR-589-5p and promoted the maturation of miR-589-5p. Overexpressed miR-589-5p and METTL3 promoted the viability, migration and invasion of liver cancer cells, while the effects of silencing miR-589-5p and METTL3 on the cells were the opposite. The effects of METTL3 overexpression and silencing were reversed by miR-589-5p inhibitor and mimic, respectively. In vivo study showed that METLL3 silencing inhibited the growth of xenograft tumour and the expressions of METTL3, MMP-2, N-cadherin and Vimentin, promoted the expressions of TIMP-2 and E-cadherin, while miR-589-5p mimic caused the opposite results and further reversed the effects of METLL3 silencing. In summary, this study found that METTL3-mediated maturation of miR-589-5p promoted the malignant development of liver cancer.",-1
Using amino acid features to identify the pathogenicity of influenza B virus,"Background:                    Influenza B virus can cause epidemics with high pathogenicity, so it poses a serious threat to public health. A feature representation algorithm is proposed in this paper to identify the pathogenicity phenotype of influenza B virus.              Methods:                    The dataset included all 11 influenza virus proteins encoded in eight genome segments of 1724 strains. Two types of features were hierarchically used to build the prediction model. Amino acid features were directly delivered from 67 feature descriptors and input into the random forest classifier to output informative features about the class label and probabilistic prediction. The sequential forward search strategy was used to optimize the informative features. The final features for each strain had low dimensions and included knowledge from different perspectives, which were used to build the machine learning model for pathogenicity identification.              Results:                    The 40 signature positions were achieved by entropy screening. Mutations at position 135 of the hemagglutinin protein had the highest entropy value (1.06). After the informative features were directly generated from the 67 random forest models, the dimensions for class and probabilistic features were optimized as 4 and 3, respectively. The optimal class features had a maximum accuracy of 94.2% and a maximum Matthews correlation coefficient of 88.4%, while the optimal probabilistic features had a maximum accuracy of 94.1% and a maximum Matthews correlation coefficient of 88.2%. The optimized features outperformed the original informative features and amino acid features from individual descriptors. The sequential forward search strategy had better performance than the classical ensemble method.              Conclusions:                    The optimized informative features had the best performance and were used to build a predictive model so as to identify the phenotype of influenza B virus with high pathogenicity and provide early risk warning for disease control.",-1
Application of machine learning methods for predicting infant mortality in Rwanda: analysis of Rwanda demographic health survey 2014-15 dataset,"Background:                    Extensive research on infant mortality (IM) exists in developing countries; however, most of the methods applied thus far relied on conventional regression analyses with limited prediction capability. Advanced of Machine Learning (AML) methods provide accurate prediction of IM; however, there is no study conducted using ML methods in Rwanda. This study, therefore, applied Machine Learning Methods for predicting infant mortality in Rwanda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was conducted using the 2014-15 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. Python software version 3.8 was employed to test and apply ML methods through Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression. STATA version 13 was used for analysing conventional methods. Evaluation metrics methods specifically confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) were used to evaluate the performance of predictive models.              Results:                    Ability of prediction was between 68.6% and 61.5% for AML. We preferred with the RF model (61.5%) presenting the best performance. The RF model was the best predictive model of IM with accuracy (84.3%), recall (91.3%), precision (80.3%), F1 score (85.5%), and AUROC (84.2%); followed by decision tree model with model accuracy (83%), recall (91%), precision (79%), F1 score (84.67%) and AUROC(82.9%), followed by support vector machine with model accuracy (68.6%), recall (74.9%), precision(67%), F1 score (70.73%) and AUROC (68.6%) and last was a logistic regression with the low accuracy of prediction (61.5%), recall (61.1%), precision (62.2%), F1 score (61.6%) and AUROC (61.5%) compared to other predictive models. Our predictive models showed that marital status, children ever born, birth order and wealth index are the 4 top predictors of IM.              Conclusions:                    In developing a predictive model, ML methods are used to classify certain hidden information that could not be detected by traditional statistical methods. Random Forest was classified as the best classifier to be used for the predictive models of IM.",-1
Oxidative stress specifically inhibits replication of dengue virus,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically active species which are involved in maintaining cellular and signalling processes at physiological concentrations. Therefore, cellular components that regulate redox balance are likely to play a crucial role in viral life-cycle either as promoters of viral replication or with antiviral functions. Zinc is an essential micronutrient associated with anti-oxidative systems and helps in maintaining a balanced cellular redox state. Here, we show that zinc chelation leads to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in epithelial cells and addition of zinc restores ROS levels to basal state. Addition of ROS (H2O2) inhibited dengue virus (DENV) infection in a dose-dependent manner indicating that oxidative stress has adverse effects on DENV infection. ROS affects early stages of DENV replication as observed by quantitation of positive and negative strand viral RNA. We observed that addition of ROS specifically affected viral titres of positive strand RNA viruses. We further demonstrate that ROS specifically altered SEC31A expression at the ER suggesting a role for SEC31A-mediated pathways in the life-cycle of positive strand RNA viruses and provides an opportunity to identify drug targets regulating oxidative stress responses for antiviral development.",-1
A tripodal wheeled mobile robot driven by a liquid metal motor,"As a novel driving concept, the liquid metal motor (LMM) has been regarded as a promising actuator due to its unique traits, such as infinitely variable speed, lack of transmission chain, convenient maintenance, and silence. However, at present, driving devices based on this material are still in the preliminary and rudimentary stage, and representative application examples are scarce. Therefore, an 8-shaped tripodal wheeled mobile robot (WMR) completely driven by a LMM is designed in this study to further prove the practicability of this material. Through combining the Marangoni surface flow on a liquid metal droplet (LMD) caused by an electrochemical reaction and the eccentric torque generated by the change in droplet shape and position, the two independently driven wheels of the mobile robot are actuated at differential moving speeds. Additionally, a matching control module, a cell phone application, and a battery have been developed and added for wireless control of three types of driving functions (moving forward, steering, and stopping). It is expected that this work could further advance the development and application of LMMs and bring new ideas to the design of WMRs.",-1
"Accuracy of Tri-ponderal Mass Index and Body Mass Index in Estimating Insulin Resistance, Hyperlipidemia, Impaired Liver Enzymes or Thyroid Hormone Function and Vitamin D Levels in Children and Adolescents","Objective:                    Tri-ponderal mass index (TMI) has been reported to estimate body fat more accurately than body mass index (BMI). This study aimed to compare the efficacy of TMI and BMI in predicting insulin resistance (IR), hyperlipidemia, impaired liver enzymes or thyroid hormone function and vitamin D concentration.              Methods:                    One hundred and forty-three overweight or obese children, based on BMI-standard deviation (SD) scoring (BMI-SDS) were studied retrospectively. TMI thresholds for overweight status were 16.0 kg/m3 for boys and 16.8 kg/m3 for girls and 18.8 kg/m3 for boys and 19.7 kg/m3 for girls for obese status.              Results:                    Twenty-two overweight and eight obese children by BMI-SDS were classified as normal by TMI. Of the overweight children 22 (22.7%) had IR and IR was detected in 2 of 8 obese children with normal TMI. There was no increase in liver enzymes in any of the children with normal TMI. Forty-four obese children were overweight according to TMI and IR was detected in 40.9%. Thyroid stimulating hormone levels were significantly higher in BMI-based obese children. Vitamin D levels were similar in all groups of both classifications.              Conclusion:                    When TMI was used there may be a risk of overlooking IR. However, if it is assumed that liver enzymes are elevated as a result of visceral adiposity, TMI can be used as an auxiliary parameter to show visceral effects of adiposity. Normal TMI may indicate that visceral organ functions have not deteriorated yet. More studies are needed to evaluate TMI as a clinical tool.",-1
Update of Indoles: Promising molecules for ameliorating metabolic diseases,"Obesity and metabolic disorders have gradually become public health-threatening problems. The metabolic disorder is a cluster of complex metabolic abnormalities which are featured by dysfunction in glucose and lipid metabolism, and results from the increasing prevalence of visceral obesity. With the core driving factor of insulin resistance, metabolic disorder mainly includes type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), micro and macro-vascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), dyslipidemia, and the dysfunction of gut microbiota. Strategies and therapeutic attention are demanded to decrease the high risk of metabolic diseases, from lifestyle changes to drug treatment, especially herbal medicines. Indole is a parent substance of numerous bioactive compounds, and itself can be produced by tryptophan catabolism to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion and inhibit the development of obesity. In addition, in heterocycles drug discovery, the indole scaffold is primarily found in natural compounds with versatile biological activity and plays a prominent role in drug molecules synthesis. In recent decades, plenty of natural or synthesized indole deriviatives have been investigated and elucidated to exert effects on regulating glucose hemeostasis and lipd metabolism. The aim of this review is to trace and emphasize the compounds containing indole scaffold that possess immense potency on preventing metabolic disorders, particularly T2DM, obesity and NAFLD, along with the underlying molecular mechanisms, therefore facilitate a better comprehension of their druggability and application in metabolic diseases.",-1
Incorporation of CD55 into the Zika Viral Envelope Contributes to Its Stability against Human Complement,"The rapid spread of the virus in Latin America and the association of the infection with microcephaly in newborns or Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome in adults prompted the WHO to declare the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic to be an international public health emergency in 2016. As the virus was first discovered in monkeys and is spread not only by mosquitos but also from human to human, we investigated the stability to the human complement of ZIKV derived from mosquito (ZIKVInsect), monkey (ZIKVVero), or human cells (ZIKVA549 and ZIKVFibro), respectively. At a low serum concentration (10%), which refers to complement concentrations found on mucosal surfaces, the virus was relatively stable at 37 Â°C. At higher complement levels (up to 50% serum concentration), ZIKV titers differed significantly depending on the cell line used for the propagation of the virus. While the viral titer of ZIKVInsect decreased about two orders in magnitude, when incubated with human serum, the virus derived from human cells was more resistant to complement-mediated lysis (CML). By virus-capture assay and Western blots, the complement regulator protein CD55 was identified to be incorporated into the viral envelope. Blocking of CD55 by neutralizing Abs significantly increased the sensitivity to human complement. Taken together, these data indicate that the incorporation of CD55 from human cells contributes to the stability of ZIKV against complement-mediated virolysis.",-1
circRNA_101277 Influences Cisplatin Resistance of Colorectal Cancer Cells by Modulating the miR-370/IL-6 Axis,"Background:                    Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent malignancies globally. Early detection of precancerous lesions through routine colonoscopy has led to a dramatic reduction in CRC-related incidence and mortality among those between the ages of 50 and 70. However, in those where the disease progresses to an advanced stage, chemotherapy remains the primary available treatment option, and the associated 5-year survival rate remains low. The identification of genes associated with CRC chemoresistance would thus be a beneficial approach to identifying novel treatments for this deadly disease.              Methods:                    The expression of circRNA_101277, miR-370, and IL-6 was assessed via qRT-PCR. IL-6 levels were measured with a human IL-6 ELISA kit based on the provided protocols. CRC cellular proliferation and cisplatin IC50 values were quantified via MTT assays. Luciferase assays were used to detect circRNA_101277 and miR-370 binding sites or miR-370 and IL-6 binding sites.              Results:                    circRNA_101277 was increased in CRC tissues compared with control samples. circRNA_101277 overexpression was evident in CRC cells, and knockdown of this circRNA suppressed cellular proliferation and cisplatin resistance in these cancer cells. At a mechanistic level, circRNA_101277 was found to function by sequestering miR-370, thereby upregulating the miR-370 target gene IL-6 and promoting cisplatin resistance via this miR-370/IL-6 axis.              Conclusion:                    In summary, our data highlight circRNA_101277 as a novel driver of CRC cell cisplatin resistance that functions by sequestering miR-370 and thereby enhancing IL-6 expression. These findings suggest that this circRNA_101277/miR-370/IL-6 axis may represent a critical axis of chemoresistance in CRC that can be targeted to diagnose and/or treat this cancer.",-1
Predictive Factors of Functioning Adrenal Incidentaloma: A 15-Year Retrospective Study,"Background and Objectives: Adrenal incidentaloma is an adrenal mass that is found incidentally in abdominal imaging studies. It is important to categorize whether the mass is a functioning or non-functioning incidentaloma to determine the appropriate management and follow-up. Our study aimed to identify predictive factors for functioning adrenal incidentaloma that could assist in early detection and in determining which patients may require hormonal investigations. Materials and methods: This 15-year retrospective study was performed in a tertiary care medical center. A total of 244 patients with adrenal incidentaloma were identified, of whom 88 had functioning adrenal incidentaloma. The patients' clinical biochemical factors and radiographic parameters were reviewed. Multivariable analysis using logistic regression with backward stepwise selection analysis was performed. Results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: A significant clinical predictor for functioning adrenal incidentaloma is a history of hypertension (OR 2.72, 95% CI(1.53, 4.82)), while significant radiological predictors include mass size &gt;4 cm (OR 2.20, 95% CI(1.20, 4.02)) and Hounsfield units (HU) &lt; 10 (OR 2.47, 95% CI(1.23, 4.94)). Conclusions: These easy-to-obtain clinical and radiological predictors can be used to help identify functioning adrenal incidentaloma. In clinical practice, taking these factors into consideration could potentially reduce the number of investigations required to diagnose functioning adrenal incidentaloma.",-1
"Role of Branched-Chain Amino Acid Metabolism in Type 2 Diabetes, Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) include leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Mammalians cannot synthesize these amino acids de novo and must acquire them through their diet. High levels of BCAAs are associated with insulin resistance; type 2 diabetes; obesity; and non-metabolic diseases, including several forms of cancer. BCAAs-in particular leucine-activate the rapamycin complex1 mTORC1, which regulates cell growth and metabolism, glucose metabolism and several more essential physiological processes. Diets rich in BCAAs are associated with metabolic diseases (listed above), while diets low in BCAAs are generally reported to promote metabolic health. As for the dysregulation of the metabolism caused by high levels of BCAAs, recent studies propose that the accumulation of acyl-carnitine and diacyl-CoA in muscles alters lipid metabolism. However, this suggestion is not broadly accepted. On clinical grounds, pre- and post-operative metabolic profiles of candidate patients for bariatric surgery are being used to select the optimal procedure for each individual patient.",-1
Inhibition of gut microbial Î²-glucuronidase effectively prevents carcinogen-induced microbial dysbiosis and intestinal tumorigenesis,"The bidirectional interaction between carcinogens and gut microbiota that contributes to colorectal cancer is complicated. Reactivation of carcinogen metabolites by microbial Î²-glucuronidase (Î²G) in the gut potentially plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. We assessed the chemoprotective effects and associated changes in gut microbiota induced by pre-administration of bacterial-specific Î²G inhibitor TCH-3511 in carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)-treated APCMin/+ mice. AOM induced intestinal Î²G activity, which was reflected in increases in the incidence, formation, and number of tumors in the intestine. Notably, inhibition of gut microbial Î²G by TCH-3511 significantly reduced AOM-induced intestinal Î²G activity, decreased the number of polyps in both the small and large intestine to a frequency that was similar in mice without AOM exposure. AOM also led to lower diversity and altered composition in the gut microbiota with a significant increase in mucin-degrading Akkermansia genus. Conversely, mice treated with TCH-3511 and AOM exhibited a more similar gut microbiota structure as mice without AOM administration. Importantly, TCH-3511 treatment significant decreased Akkermansia genus and produced a concomitant increase in short-chain fatty acid butyrate-producing gut commensal microbes Lachnoospiraceae NK4A136 group genus in AOM-treated mice. Taken together, our results reveal a key role of gut microbial Î²G in promoting AOM-induced gut microbial dysbiosis and intestinal tumorigenesis, indicating the chemoprotective benefit of gut microbial Î²G inhibition against carcinogens via maintaining the gut microbiota balance and preventing cancer-associated gut microbial dysbiosis. Thus, the bacterial-specific Î²G inhibitor TCH-3511 is a potential chemoprevention agent for colorectal cancer.",-1
A cell atlas of microbe-responsive processes in the zebrafish intestine,"Gut microbial products direct growth, differentiation, and development in animal hosts. However, we lack system-wide understanding of cell-specific responses to the microbiome. We profiled cell transcriptomes from the intestine, and associated tissue, of zebrafish larvae raised in the presence or absence of a microbiome. We uncovered extensive cellular heterogeneity in the conventional zebrafish intestinal epithelium, including previously undescribed cell types with known mammalian homologs. By comparing conventional to germ-free profiles, we mapped microbial impacts on transcriptional activity in each cell population. We revealed intricate degrees of cellular specificity in host responses to the microbiome that included regulatory effects on patterning and on metabolic and immune activity. For example, we showed that the absence of microbes hindered pro-angiogenic signals in the developing vasculature, causing impaired intestinal vascularization. Our work provides a high-resolution atlas of intestinal cellular composition in the developing fish gut and details the effects of the microbiome on each cell type.",-1
"RNF185 antisense RNA 1 (RNF185-AS1) promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in papillary thyroid carcinoma","Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in multiple cancers. So far, the exact function of lncRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is unclear. The purposes of this work were to investigate the function and underlying mechanisms of RNF185 antisense RNA 1 (RNF185-AS1) in PTC. The expression of RNF185-AS1 was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were utilized to determine cell proliferation. Cell migration and invasion were tested using wound healing and transwell assays. A mouse transplantation tumor model was used for tumor growth analyses in vivo. The regulation of RNF185-AS1 on the downstream miR-429/lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP4) axis was predicted and identified through bioinformatic analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. RNF185-AS1 was dramatically overexpressed in PTC tumors and cells. High RNF185-AS1 expression was associated with bigger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor-node-metastasis stage in PTC patients. Silencing of RNF185-AS1 impeded the proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and constrained tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, RNF185-AS1 could act as a sponge of miR-429 to regulate the expression of LRP4. In addition, downregulation of miR-429 or upregulation of LRP4 could relieve the proliferation, migration, and invasion of IHH-4 and TPC-1 cells that inhibited by RNF185-AS1 knockdown. Downregulation of RNF185-AS1 may suppress PTC progression through functioning as a sponge of miR-429 to hinder the expression of LRP4. The RNF185-AS1/miR-429/LRP4 axis will lay the groundwork for future therapeutic strategies in PTC.",-1
"Effects of fasting, feeding and exercise on plasma acylcarnitines among subjects with CPT2D, VLCADD and LCHADD/TFPD","Background:                    The plasma acylcarnitine profile is frequently used as a biochemical assessment for follow-up in diagnosed patients with fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs). Disease specific acylcarnitine species are elevated during metabolic decompensation but there is clinical and biochemical heterogeneity among patients and limited data on the utility of an acylcarnitine profile for routine clinical monitoring.              Methods:                    We evaluated plasma acylcarnitine profiles from 30 diagnosed patients with long-chain FAODs (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2 (CPT2), very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), and long-chain 3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase or mitochondrial trifunctional protein (LCHAD/TFP) deficiencies) collected after an overnight fast, after feeding a controlled low-fat diet, and before and after moderate exercise. Our purpose was to describe the variability in this biomarker and how various physiologic states effect the acylcarnitine concentrations in circulation.              Results:                    Disease specific acylcarnitine species were higher after an overnight fast and decreased by approximately 60% two hours after a controlled breakfast meal. Moderate-intensity exercise increased the acylcarnitine species but it varied by diagnosis. When analyzed for a genotype/phenotype correlation, the presence of the common LCHADD mutation (c.1528G > C) was associated with higher levels of 3-hydroxyacylcarnitines than in patients with other mutations.              Conclusions:                    We found that feeding consistently suppressed and that moderate intensity exercise increased disease specific acylcarnitine species, but the response to exercise was highly variable across subjects and diagnoses. The clinical utility of routine plasma acylcarnitine analysis for outpatient treatment monitoring remains questionable; however, if acylcarnitine profiles are measured in the clinical setting, standardized procedures are required for sample collection to be of value.",-1
Spatiotemporal variations of air pollutants and ozone prediction using machine learning algorithms in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2014 to 2021,"China was seriously affected by air pollution in the past decade, especially for particulate matter (PM) and emerging ozone pollution recently. In this study, we systematically examined the spatiotemporal variations of six air pollutants and conducted ozone prediction using machine learning (ML) algorithms in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The annual-average concentrations of CO, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 decreased at a rate of 141, 11.0, 6.6 and 5.6 Î¼g/m3/year, while a pattern of initial increase and later decrease was observed for NO2 and O3_8 h. The concentration of SO2, CO and NO2 was higher in Tangshan and Xingtai, while northern BTH region has lower levels of CO, NO2 and PM. Spatial variations of ozone were relatively small in the BTH region. Monthly variations of PM10 displayed an increase in March probably due to wind-blown dusts from Northwest China. A seasonal and diurnal pattern with summer and afternoon peaks was found for ozone, which was contrast with other pollutants. Further ML algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) model and Decision tree (DT) regression showed good ozone prediction performance (daily: R2 = 0.83 and 0.73, RMSE = 30.0 and 37.3 Î¼g/m3, respectively; monthly: R2 = 0.93 and 0.88, RMSE = 12.1 and 15.8 Î¼g/m3, respectively) based on 10-fold cross-validation. Both RF model and DT regression relied more on the spatial trend as higher temporal prediction performance was achieved. Solar radiation- and temperature-related variables presented high importance at daily level, whereas sea level pressure dominated at monthly level. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity in variable importance was further confirmed using case studies based on RF model. In addition, variable importance was possibly influenced by the emission reductions due to COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its possible weakness to capture ozone extremes, RF model was beneficial and suggested for predicting spatiotemporal variations of ozone in future studies.",-1
An Integrated Multiple Electrochemical miRNA Sensing System Embedded into a Microfluidic Chip,"In this article, we present the design, fabrication and characterization of a microfluidic device and a dedicated electronic system to perform 8 multiplexed electrochemical measurements of synthetic miRNA strands, as well as the biochemical protocols developed for the functionalization of the electrodes and the quantification experiments. The outcomes of this work highlight that the parallelization of eight microchannels containing 2-electrode cells driven by the dedicated electronics offers a solution as robust as a conventional 3-electrode cell and commercially available potentiostats. In addition, this solution presents the advantage of simultaneously reduce the microfabrication complexity, as well as offering an integrated; multiplexed and portable system for the quantification of miRNA. The results presented demonstrate that the system shows a linear response on concentrations down to 10-18 mol/L of perfect matched reporter and capture sequences of synthetic miRNA.",-1
"Population genetic structure of the Asian bush mosquito, Aedes japonicus (Diptera, Culicidae), in Belgium suggests multiple introductions","Background:                    Aedes japonicus japonicus has expanded beyond its native range and has established in multiple European countries, including Belgium. In addition to the population located at Natoye, Belgium, locally established since 2002, specimens were recently collected along the Belgian border. The first objective of this study was therefore to investigate the origin of these new introductions, which were assumed to be related to the expansion of the nearby population in western Germany. Also, an intensive elimination campaign was undertaken at Natoye between 2012 and 2015, after which the species was declared to be eradicated. This species was re-detected in 2017, and thus the second objective was to investigate if these specimens resulted from a new introduction event and/or from a few undetected specimens that escaped the elimination campaign.              Methods:                    Population genetic variation at nad4 and seven microsatellite loci was surveyed in 224 and 68 specimens collected in Belgium and Germany, respectively. German samples were included as reference to investigate putative introduction source(s). At Natoye, 52 and 135 specimens were collected before and after the elimination campaign, respectively, to investigate temporal changes in the genetic composition and diversity.              Results:                    At Natoye, the genotypic microsatellite make-up showed a clear difference before and after the elimination campaign. Also, the population after 2017 displayed an increased allelic richness and number of private alleles, indicative of new introduction(s). However, the Natoye population present before the elimination programme is believed to have survived at low density. At the Belgian border, clustering results suggest a relation with the western German population. Whether the introduction(s) occur via passive human-mediated ground transport or, alternatively, by natural spread cannot be determined yet from the dataset.              Conclusion:                    Further introductions within Belgium are expected to occur in the near future, especially along the eastern Belgian border, which is at the front of the invasion of Ae. japonicus towards the west. Our results also point to the complexity of controlling invasive species, since 4 years of intense control measures were found to be not completely successful at eliminating this exotic at Natoye.",-1
Docosahexaenoic Acid Suppresses Oxidative Stress-Induced Autophagy and Cell Death via the AMPK-Dependent Signaling Pathway in Immortalized Fischer Rat Schwann Cells 1,"Autophagy is the process by which intracellular components are degraded by lysosomes. It is also activated by oxidative stress; hence, autophagy is thought to be closely related to oxidative stress, one of the major causes of diabetic neuropathy. We previously reported that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) induced antioxidant enzymes and protected Schwann cells from oxidative stress. However, the relationship between autophagy and oxidative stress-induced cell death in diabetic neuropathy has not been elucidated. Treatment with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) decreased the cell survival rate, as measured by an MTT assay in immortalized Fischer rat Schwann cells 1 (IFRS1). A DHA pretreatment significantly prevented tBHP-induced cytotoxicity. tBHP increased autophagy, which was revealed by the ratio of the initiation markers, AMP-activated protein kinase, and UNC51-like kinase phosphorylation. Conversely, the DHA pretreatment suppressed excessive tBHP-induced autophagy signaling. Autophagosomes induced by tBHP in IFRS1 cells were decreased to control levels by the DHA pretreatment whereas autolysosomes were only partially decreased. These results suggest that DHA attenuated excessive autophagy induced by oxidative stress in Schwann cells and may be useful to prevent or reduce cell death in vitro. However, its potentiality to treat diabetic neuropathy must be validated in in vivo studies.",-1
The Nutritional Intervention of Resveratrol Can Effectively Alleviate the Intestinal Inflammation Associated With Celiac Disease Induced by Wheat Gluten,"Background and aims:                    Wheat gluten is a critical trigger for celiac disease, often causing inflammatory lesions and oxidative stress damage in the intestines of patients. In daily life, it is difficult for celiac disease patients to strictly avoid the dietary intake of gluten, which makes complementary preventive therapy particularly urgent. As such, we investigated the alleviating effects of resveratrol in vivo and in vitro models of celiac disease.              Methods:                    We established in vivo and in vitro models of gluten protein-induced celiac disease. The intervention effect of resveratrol was defined well based on relevant indicators of inflammation, immunity and oxidative stress, and its possible involvement in signaling pathways and genes were also identified.              Results:                    Resveratrol was effective in reducing intestinal oxidative stress and inflammatory damage induced by wheat gluten in both cell and mouse models for celiac disease. We identified correlations between the genes (Fgf15, Nr0b2, Aire and Ubd) and signaling pathways (PPAR, AMPK and FoxO) in which resveratrol performed critical roles.              Conclusions:                    Resveratrol contributed to regulate development of autoimmunity through up-regulation of Aire and Ubd genes and promote nutrient absorption in intestine through down-regulation of Fgf15 and Nr0b2 genes, as well as played a role in regulating complex response system of oxidative stress, inflammatory response and immune response in intestine by activating PPAR, AMPK and FoxO signaling pathways, thus effectively alleviating the intestinal symptoms of celiac disease.",-1
Are changes in the gut microbiome a contributor or consequence of autism-why not both?,"Alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but whether they are a cause, effect, or confounder remains unclear. In a recent issue of Cell, Yap and colleagues report that ASD-associated microbiota changes are likely a consequence of low diet diversity.1.",-1
Potential Role of the Gut Microbiome In Colorectal Cancer Progression,"An increasing number of studies have revealed that the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) is related to gut microbiome composition. Under normal conditions, the gut microbiome acts as a barrier to other pathogens or infections in the intestine and modulates inflammation by affecting the host immune system. These gut microbiota are not only related to the intestinal inflammation associated with tumorigenesis but also modulation of the anti-cancer immune response. Thus, they are associated with tumor progression and anti-cancer treatment efficacy. Studies have shown that the gut microbiota can be used as biomarkers to predict the effect of immunotherapy and improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in treating CRC through modulation. In this review, we discuss the role of the gut microbiome as revealed by recent studies of the growth and progression of CRC along with its synergistic effect with anti-cancer treatment modalities.",-1
A Structural Perspective on Calprotectin as a Ligand of Receptors Mediating Inflammation and Potential Drug Target,"Calprotectin, a heterodimer of S100A8 and S100A9 EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, is an integral part of the innate immune response. Calprotectin (CP) serves as a ligand for several pattern recognition cell surface receptors including the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33). The receptors initiate kinase signaling cascades that activate inflammation through the NF-kB pathway. Receptor activation by CP leads to upregulation of both receptor and ligand, a positive feedback loop associated with specific chronic inflammatory syndromes. Hence, CP and its two constituent homodimers have been viewed as potential targets to suppress certain chronic inflammation pathologies. A variety of inhibitors of CP and other S100 proteins have been investigated for more than 30 years, but no candidates have advanced significantly into clinical trials. Here, current knowledge of the interactions of CP with its receptors is reviewed along with recent progress towards the development of CP-directed chemotherapeutics.",-1
Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 3 Suppress Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Production and Thrombosis During Sepsis,"Sepsis consists of life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated response to infection. Recent studies have found that excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a small glycerophospholipid molecule that exerts multiple functions by binding to its receptors. Although LPA has been functionally identified to induce NETs, whether and how LPA receptors, especially lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPA3), play a role in the development of sepsis has never been explored. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of LPA3 on sepsis is essential for the development of medical therapy. After intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Lpar3 -/-mice showed a substantially higher mortality, more severe injury, and more fibrinogen content in the lungs than wild-type (WT) mice. The values of blood coagulation markers, plasma prothrombin time (PT) and fibrinogen (FIB), indicated that the Lpar3 -/- mice underwent a severe coagulation process, which resulted in increased thrombosis. The levels of NETs in Lpar3 -/- mice were higher than those in WT mice after LPS injection. The mortality rate and degree of lung damage in Lpar3 -/- mice with sepsis were significantly reduced after the destruction of NETs by DNaseI treatment. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with co-cultured monocytes and neutrophils demonstrated that monocytes from Lpar3 -/- mice promoted the formation of NETs, suggesting that LPA3 acting on monocytes inhibits the formation of NETs and plays a protective role in sepsis. Mechanistically, we found that the amount of CD14, an LPS co-receptor, expressed by monocytes in Lpar3 -/-mice was significantly elevated after LPS administration, and the MyD88-p65-NFÎºB signaling axis, downstream of toll-like receptor 4 signaling, in monocytes was overactivated. Finally, after an injection of the LPA3 agonist (2S)-1-oleoyl-2-methylglycero-3-phosphothionate (OMPT), the survival rate of mice with sepsis was improved, organ damage was reduced, and the production of NETs was decreased. This suggested the possible translational value and application prospects of (2S)-OMPT in the treatment of sepsis. Our study confirms an important protective role of LPA3 in curbing the development of sepsis by suppressing NETs production and thrombosis and provides new ideas for sepsis treatment strategies.",-1
Sweet Snacks Are Positively and Fruits and Vegetables Are Negatively Associated with Visceral or Liver Fat Content in Middle-Aged Men and Women,"Background:                    Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) are major risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases.              Objective:                    We aimed to investigate the association of dietary intake of the main food groups with VAT and HTGC in middle-aged men and women.              Methods:                    We used data from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, a population-based study including 6671 participants aged 45-65 y at baseline. In this cross-sectional analysis, VAT and HTGC were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, respectively, as the primary outcomes. Habitual intake of main food groups (dairy, meat, fish, fruits and vegetables, sweet snacks, and fats and oils) was estimated through the use of a food-frequency questionnaire. We examined associations of intake of different food groups with VAT and HTGC by linear regression analysis stratified by sex and adjusted for age, smoking, education, ethnicity, physical activity, basal metabolic rate, energy-restricted diet, menopausal state, and total energy intake.              Results:                    In women, a 100-g/d higher intake of dairy was associated with 2.0 cm2 less VAT (95% CI: -3.4, -0.7 cm2) and a 0.95-fold lower HTGC (95% CI: 0.90-, 0.99-fold). Moreover, a 100-g/d higher intake of fruit and vegetables was associated with 1.6 cm2 less VAT (95% CI: -2.9, -0.2 cm2) in women. Fruit and vegetables were negatively associated (0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.00) with HTGC, and sweet snacks were positively associated (1.29; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.63). Patterns were weaker but similar in men. Fish intake was not associated with VAT or HTGC and plant-based fat and oil intake were only associated with VAT after adjustment for total body fat.              Conclusions:                    Despite some variation in the strength of the associations between men and women, dietary intake of sweet snacks was positively associated with HTGC, and fruit and vegetable intake were negatively associated with visceral and liver fat content. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results. The Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov with identifier NCT03410316.",-1
Maternal high-fat diet during suckling programs visceral adiposity and epigenetic regulation of adipose tissue stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 in offspring,"Objective:                    The lactation-suckling period is critical for white adipose tissue (WAT) development. Early postnatal nutrition influences later obesity risk but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we tested whether altered postnatal nutrition specifically during suckling impacts epigenetic regulation of key metabolic genes in WAT and alter long-term adiposity set point.              Methods:                    We analyzed the effects of maternal high-fat (HF) feeding in rats exclusively during lactation-suckling on breast milk composition and its impact on male offspring visceral epidydimal (eWAT) and subcutaneous inguinal (iWAT) depots during suckling and in adulthood.              Results:                    Maternal HF feeding during lactation had no effect on mothers' body weight (BW) or global breast milk composition, but induced qualitative changes in breast milk fatty acid (FA) composition (high n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated FA ratio and low medium-chain FA content). During suckling, HF neonates showed increased BW and mass of both eWAT and iWAT depot but only eWAT displayed an enhanced adipogenic transcriptional signature. In adulthood, HF offspring were predisposed to weight gain and showed increased hyperplastic growth only in eWAT. This specific eWAT expansion was associated with increased expression and activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a key enzyme of FA metabolism. SCD1 converts saturated FAs, e.g. palmitate and stearate, to monounsaturated FAs, palmitoleate and oleate, which are the predominant substrates for triglyceride synthesis. Scd1 upregulation in eWAT was associated with reduced DNA methylation in Scd1 promoter surrounding a PPARÎ³-binding region. Conversely, changes in SCD1 levels and methylation were not observed in iWAT, coherent with a depot-specific programming.              Conclusions:                    Our data reveal that maternal HF feeding during suckling programs long-term eWAT expansion in part by SCD1 epigenetic reprogramming. This programming events occurred with drastic changes in breast milk FA composition, suggesting that dietary FAs are key metabolic programming factors in the early postnatal period.",-1
"A time-incorporated SOFA score-based machine learning model for predicting mortality in critically ill patients: A multicenter, real-world study","Background:                    Organ dysfunction (OD) assessment is essential in intensive care units (ICUs). However, current OD assessment scores merely describe the number and the severity of each OD, without evaluating the duration of organ injury. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a machine learning model based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for the prediction of mortality in critically ill patients.              Material and methods:                    Data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) -III were mixed for model development. The MIMIC-IV and Nanjing Jinling Hospital Surgical ICU database were used as external test set A and set B, respectively. The outcome of interest was in-ICU mortality. A modified SOFA model incorporating time-dimension (T-SOFA) was stepwise developed to predict ICU mortality using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine, random forest and logistic regression algorithms. Time-dimensional features were calculated based on six consecutive SOFA scores collected every 12 h within the first three days of admission. The predictive performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) and calibration plot.              Results:                    A total of 82,132 patients from the real-world datasets were included in this study, and 7,494 patients (9.12%) died during their ICU stay. The T-SOFA M3 that incorporated the time-dimension features and age, using the XGBoost algorithm, significantly outperformed the original SOFA score in the validation set (AUROC 0.800 95% CI [0.787-0.813] vs. 0.693 95% CI [0.678-0.709], p < 0.01). Good discrimination and calibration were maintained in the test set A and B, with AUROC of 0.803, 95% CI [0.791-0.815] and 0.830, 95% CI [0.789-0.870], respectively.              Conclusions:                    The time-incorporated T-SOFA model could significantly improve the prediction performance of the original SOFA score and is of potential for identifying high-risk patients in future clinical application.",-1
Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates atherosclerosis in mice with C1q/TNF-related protein 9 genetic deficiency,"Despite the strong influence of the gut microbiota on atherosclerosis, a causal relationship between atherosclerosis pathophysiology and gut microbiota is still unverified. This study was performed to determine the impact of the gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis caused by genetic deficiency. To elucidate the influence of the gut microbiota on atherosclerosis pathogenesis, an atherosclerosis-prone mouse model (C1q/TNF-related protein 9-knockout (CTRP9-KO) mice) was generated. The gut microbial compositions of CTRP9-KO and WT control mice were compared. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to confirm the association between gut microbial composition and the progression of atherosclerosis. FMT largely affected the gut microbiota in both CTRP9-KO and WT mice, and all transplanted mice acquired the gut microbiotas of the donor mice. Atherosclerotic lesions in the carotid arteries were decreased in transplanted CTRP9-KO mice compared to CTRP9-KO mice prior to transplantation. Conversely, WT mice transplanted with the gut microbiotas of CTRP9-KO mice showed the opposite effect as that of CTRP9-KO mice transplanted with the gut microbiotas of WT mice. Here, we show that CTRP9 gene deficiency is related to the distribution of the gut microbiota in subjects with atherosclerosis. Transplantation of WT microbiotas into CTRP9-KO mice protected against the progression of atherosclerosis. Conversely, the transplantation of CTRP9-KO microbiotas into WT mice promoted the progression of atherosclerosis. Treating atherosclerosis by restoring gut microbial homeostasis may be an effective therapeutic strategy.",-1
"Characterization of a Read-through Fusion Transcript, BCL2L2-PABPN1, Involved in Porcine Adipogenesis","cis-Splicing of adjacent genes (cis-SAGe) has been involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes in humans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of cis-SAGe in adipogenic regulation. In this study, a cis-SAGe product, BCL2L2-PABPN1 (BP), was characterized in fat tissue of pigs with RT-PCR and RACE method. BP is an in-frame fusion product composed of 333 aa and all the functional domains of both parents. BP is highly conserved among species and rich in splicing variants. BP was found to promote proliferation and inhibit differentiation of primary porcine preadipocytes. A total of 3074/44 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRs)/known miRNAs (DEmiRs) were identified in porcine preadipocytes overexpressing BP through RNA-Seq analysis. Both DEmRs and target genes of DEmiRs were involved in various fat-related pathways with MAPK and PI3K-Akt being the top enriched. PPP2CB, EGFR, Wnt5A and EHHADH were hub genes among the fat-related pathways identified. Moreover, ssc-miR-339-3p was found to be critical for BP regulating adipogenesis through integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA data. The results highlight the role of cis-SAGe in adipogenesis and contribute to further revealing the mechanisms underlying fat deposition, which will be conductive to human obesity control.",-1
Life-history theory in psychology and evolutionary biology: one research programme or two?,"The term 'life-history theory' (LHT) is increasingly often invoked in psychology, as a framework for integrating understanding of psychological traits into a broader evolutionary context. Although LHT as presented in psychology papers (LHT-P) is typically described as a straightforward extension of the theoretical principles from evolutionary biology that bear the same name (LHT-E), the two bodies of work are not well integrated. Here, through a close reading of recent papers, we argue that LHT-E and LHT-P are different research programmes in the Lakatosian sense. The core of LHT-E is built around ultimate evolutionary explanation, via explicit mathematical modelling, of how selection can drive divergent evolution of populations or species living under different demographies or ecologies. The core of LHT-P concerns measurement of covariation, across individuals, of multiple psychological traits; the proximate goals these serve; and their relation to childhood experience. Some of the links between LHT-E and LHT-P are false friends. For example, elements that are marginal in LHT-E are core commitments of LHT-P, and where explanatory principles are transferred from one to the other, nuance can be lost in transmission. The methodological rules for what grounds a prediction in theory are different in the two cases. Though there are major differences between LHT-E and LHT-P at present, there is much potential for greater integration in the future, through both theoretical modelling and further empirical research. This article is part of the theme issue 'Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.",-1
Potential effects of reduced red meat compared with increased fiber intake on glucose metabolism and liver fat content: a randomized and controlled dietary intervention study,"Background:                    Epidemiological studies suggest that an increased red meat intake is associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas an increased fiber intake is associated with a lower risk.              Objectives:                    We conducted an intervention study to investigate the effects of these nutritional factors on glucose and lipid metabolism, body-fat distribution, and liver fat content in subjects at increased risk of type 2 diabetes.              Methods:                    This prospective, randomized, and controlled dietary intervention study was performed over 6 mo. All groups decreased their daily caloric intake by 400 kcal. The ""control"" group (N = 40) only had this requirement. The ""no red meat"" group (N = 48) in addition aimed to avoid the intake of red meat, and the ""fiber"" group (N = 44) increased intake of fibers to 40 g/d. Anthropometric parameters and frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance tests were performed before and after intervention. Body-fat mass and distribution, liver fat, and liver iron content were assessed by MRI and single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.              Results:                    Participants in all groups lost weight (mean 3.3 Â± 0.5 kg, P < 0.0001). Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity improved (P < 0.001), and body and visceral fat mass decreased in all groups (P < 0.001). These changes did not differ between groups. Liver fat content decreased significantly (P < 0.001) with no differences between the groups. The decrease in liver fat correlated with the decrease in ferritin during intervention (r2 = 0.08, P = 0.0021). This association was confirmed in an independent lifestyle intervention study (Tuebingen Lifestyle Intervention Program, N = 229, P = 0.0084).              Conclusions:                    Our data indicate that caloric restriction leads to a marked improvement in glucose metabolism and body-fat composition, including liver-fat content. The marked reduction in liver fat might be mediated via changes in ferritin levels. In the context of caloric restriction, there seems to be no additional beneficial impact of reduced red meat intake and increased fiber intake on the improvement in cardiometabolic risk parameters. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03231839.",-1
Can People with Parkinson's Disease Self-Trigger Gait Initiation? A Comparison of Cueing Strategies,"Background:                    An external cue can markedly improve gait initiation in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and is often used to overcome freezing of gait (FOG). It is unknown if the effects of external cueing are comparable if the imperative stimulus is triggered by the person receiving the cue (self-triggered) or an external source.              Objective:                    Two experiments were conducted to compare the effects of self- versus externally triggered cueing on anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) during gait initiation in people with PD.              Methods:                    In experiment 1, 10 individuals with PD and FOG initiated gait without a cue or in response to a stimulus triggered by the experimenter or by the participant. Experiment 2 compared self- versus externally triggered cueing across three groups: healthy young adults (n = 16), healthy older adults (n = 11), and a group with PD (n = 10).              Results:                    Experiment 1: Externally triggered cues significantly increased APA magnitudes compared to uncued stepping, but not when the same cue was self-triggered. Experiment 2: APAs were not significantly improved with a self-triggered cue compared to un-cued stepping in both the PD and healthy older adult groups, but the young adults showed a significant facilitation of APA magnitude.              Conclusion:                    The effectiveness of an external cue on gait initiation in people with PD and older adults is critically dependent upon whether the source of the trigger is endogenous (self-produced) or exogenous (externally-generated). These results may explain why cueing interventions that rely upon self-triggering of the stimulus are often ineffective in people with PD.",-1
"Coinfection of Porcine Circovirus 2 and Pseudorabies Virus Enhances Immunosuppression and Inflammation through NF-ÎºB, JAK/STAT, MAPK, and NLRP3 Pathways","Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are economically important pathogens in swine. PCV2 and PRV coinfection can cause more severe neurological and respiratory symptoms and higher mortality of piglets. However, the exact mechanism involved in the coinfection of PRV and PCV2 and its pathogenesis remain unknown. Here, porcine kidney cells (PK-15) were infected with PCV2 and/or PRV, and then the activation of immune and inflammatory pathways was evaluated to clarify the influence of the coinfection on immune and inflammatory responses. We found that the coinfection of PCV2 and PRV can promote the activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNK), p38, and nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) pathways, thus enhancing the expression of interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), interferon-Î»1 (IFN-Î»1), interferon-stimulated gene (ISG15), interleukin 6 (IL6), and interleukin 1Î² (IL1Î²). Meanwhile, PCV2 and PRV also inhibit the expression and signal transduction of IFN-Î², tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±), and the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. In addition, PCV2 and PRV infection can also weaken extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. These results indicate that the regulations of cellular antiviral immune responses and inflammatory responses mediated by NF-ÎºB, JAK/STAT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NLRP3 pathways, contribute to immune escape of PCV2 and PRV and host antiviral responses.",-1
A Novel Method Based on GAN Using a Segmentation Module for Oligodendroglioma Pathological Image Generation,"Digital pathology analysis using deep learning has been the subject of several studies. As with other medical data, pathological data are not easily obtained. Because deep learning-based image analysis requires large amounts of data, augmentation techniques are used to increase the size of pathological datasets. This study proposes a novel method for synthesizing brain tumor pathology data using a generative model. For image synthesis, we used embedding features extracted from a segmentation module in a general generative model. We also introduce a simple solution for training a segmentation model in an environment in which the masked label of the training dataset is not supplied. As a result of this experiment, the proposed method did not make great progress in quantitative metrics but showed improved results in the confusion rate of more than 70 subjects and the quality of the visual output.",-1
An oxidation resistant pediocin PA-1 derivative and penocin A display effective anti- Listeria activity in a model human gut environment,"Pediocin PA-1 is a class IIa bacteriocin that is particularly effective against the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. The loss of activity of PA-1 pediocin due to methionine oxidation is one of the challenges that limit the wider application of the bacteriocin. In this study, we heterologously expressed an oxidation resistant form of pediocin PA-1, i.e., pediocin M31L, and compared its activity to that of native pediocin PA-1 and to penocin A, a pediocin-like bacteriocin that displays a narrower antimicrobial spectrum. Minimal inhibitory concentration assays revealed that pediocin M31L was as effective as PA-1 and more effective than synthetic penocin A against Listeria with negligible activity against a range of obligate anaerobic commensal gut bacterial species. The anti-Listeria activity of these pediocins was also assessed in a simulated human distal colon model assay using the L. monocytogenes, spiked at 6.5 Â±  0.13 Log CFU/mL, as a bioindicator. At 24 h, pediocin M31L and penocin A (2.6 Î¼M) reduced Listeria counts to 3.5 Â± 0.4 and 3.64 Â± 0.62 Log CFU/mL, respectively, whereas Listeria counts were considerably higher, i.e. 7.75 Â±  0.43 Log CFU/mL, in the non-bacteriocin-containing control. Ultimately, it was established that synthetic penocin A and the stable pediocin M31L derivative, heterologously produced, display effective anti-Listeria activity in a human gut environment.",-1
Endocan in Acute Leukemia: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives,"Endocan is a soluble dermatan sulfate proteoglycan expressed by endothelial cells and detected in serum/plasma. Its expression is increased in tumors/tumor vessels in several human malignancies, and high expression (high serum/plasma levels or tumor levels) has an adverse prognostic impact in several malignancies. The p14 endocan degradation product can also be detected in serum/plasma, but previous clinical studies as well as previously unpublished results presented in this review suggest that endocan and p14 endocan fragment levels reflect different biological characteristics, and the endocan levels seem to reflect the disease heterogeneity in acute leukemia better than the p14 fragment levels. Furthermore, decreased systemic endocan levels in previously immunocompetent sepsis patients are associated with later severe respiratory complications, but it is not known whether this is true also for immunocompromised acute leukemia patients. Finally, endocan is associated with increased early nonrelapse mortality in (acute leukemia) patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and this adverse prognostic impact seems to be independent of the adverse impact of excessive fluid overload. Systemic endocan levels may also become important to predict cytokine release syndrome after immunotherapy/haploidentical transplantation, and in the long-term follow-up of acute leukemia survivors with regard to cardiovascular risk. Therapeutic targeting of endocan is now possible, and the possible role of endocan in acute leukemia should be further investigated to clarify whether the therapeutic strategy should also be considered.",-1
Deep Neural Networks for Automatic Flower Species Localization and Recognition,"Deep neural networks are efficient methods of recognizing image patterns and have been largely implemented in computer vision applications. Object detection has many applications in computer vision, including face and vehicle detection, video surveillance, and plant leaf detection. An automatic flower identification system over categories is still challenging due to similarities among classes and intraclass variation, so the deep learning model requires more precisely labeled and high-quality data. In this proposed work, an optimized and generalized deep convolutional neural network using Faster-Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (Faster-RCNN) and Single Short Detector (SSD) is used for detecting, localizing, and classifying flower objects. We prepared 2000 images for various pretrained models, including ResNet 50, ResNet 101, and Inception V2, as well as Mobile Net V2. In this study, 70% of the images were used for training, 25% for validation, and 5% for testing. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed Faster-RCNN model using the transfer learning approach gives an optimum mAP score of 83.3% with 300 and 91.3% with 100 proposals on ten flower classes. In addition, the proposed model could identify, locate, and classify flowers and provide essential details that include flower name, class classification, and multilabeling techniques.",-1
Curcumin and Wnt/Î²âcatenin signaling in exudative ageârelated macular degeneration (Review),"Curcumin is a natural product widely used due to its pharmacological effects. Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies concerning the effects of curcumin on exudative ageârelated macular degeneration (AMD) is currently available. Since ophthalmic diseases, including exudative AMD, have a marked impact on public health, the prevention and therapy of ophthalmic disorders remain of increasing concern. Exudative AMD is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) invading the subretinal space, ultimately enhancing exudation and hemorrhaging. The exudative AMD subtype corresponds to 10 to 15% of cases of macular degeneration; however, the occurrence of this subtype has been reported as the major cause of vision loss and blindness, with the occurrence of CNV being responsible for 80% of the cases with vision loss. In CNV increased expression of VEGF has been observed, stimulated by the overactivation of Wnt/Î²âcatenin signaling pathway. The stimulation of the Wnt/Î²âcatenin signaling pathway is responsible for the activation of several cellular mechanisms, simultaneously enhancing inflammation, oxidative stress and angiogenesis in numerous diseases, including ophthalmic disorders. Some studies have previously demonstrated the possible advantage of the use of curcumin for the inhibition of Wnt/Î²âcatenin signaling. In the present review article, the different mechanisms of curcumin are described concerning its effects on oxidative stress, inflammation and angiogenesis in exudative AMD, by interacting with Wnt/Î²âcatenin signaling.",-1
"Genetic Variation in the Domain II, 3' Untranslated Region of Human and Mosquito Derived Dengue Virus Strains in Sri Lanka","Genetic variations in dengue virus (DENV) play a distinct role in epidemic emergence. The DENV 3' UTR has become a recent interest in research. The objective of the study was to examine the genetic variation in the domain II, 3' UTR region of human and mosquito-derived DENV. DENV-infected human sera were orally infected to laboratory reared Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The domain II, 3' UTR of each human- and mosquito-derived sample was amplified. The nucleotide sequence variation, phylogenetic and secondary structure analysis was carried out incorporating respective regions of so far recorded Sri Lankan and the reference genotype strains of the DENV3 and DENV1 serotypes. The human- and mosquito-derived domain II, 3' UTR were identical in nucleotide sequences within the serotypes isolated, indicating the conserved nature of the region during host switch. The sequence analysis revealed distinct variations in study isolates compared to so far recorded Sri Lankan isolates. However, despite single nucleotide variations, the maintenance of structural integrity was evident in related strains within the serotypes in the secondary structure analysis. The phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clade segregation of the study sequences from so far reported Sri Lankan isolates and illustrated the phylogenetic relations of the study sequences to the available global isolates of respective serotypes.",-1
Upregulated miR-206 Aggravates Deep Vein Thrombosis by Regulating GJA1-Mediated Autophagy of Endothelial Progenitor Cells,"Background:                    Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the third most prevalent vascular disease worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play regulatory roles in functions of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which is becoming a promising therapeutic choice for thrombus resolution. Nevertheless, the role of miR-206 in EPCs is unclear.              Methods:                    EPCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with DVT. In DVT mouse models, DVT was induced by stenosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The levels of miR-206 and gap junction protein alpha 1 (GJA1) in EPCs and vascular tissues of DVT mice were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis were tested by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, Transwell assay, flow cytometry analysis, and in vitro tube formation assay. The levels of autophagy-related proteins as well as the level of GJA1 in EPCs and vascular tissues were evaluated by western blotting. DVT formation in vivo was observed through hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The expression of thrombus resolution markers, CD34 molecule (CD34) and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2), in the thrombi was measured by immunofluorescence staining.              Results:                    miR-206 overexpression inhibited proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis and promoted apoptosis of EPCs, while miR-206 knockdown exerted an opposite effect on EPC phenotypes. Downregulation of GJA1, the target of miR-206, abolished the influence of miR-206 on EPC phenotypes. Furthermore, silencing of miR-206 suppressed the autophagy of EPCs via upregulating GJA1. miR-206 knockdown repressed thrombus formation, enhanced the homing ability of EPCs to the thrombosis site, and facilitated thrombus resolution in DVT mouse models. Additionally, miR-206 was upregulated while GJA1 was downregulated in vascular tissues of DVT mice. miR-206 knockdown elevated GJA1 expression in vascular tissues of DVT mice. The expression of miR-206 was negatively correlated with that of GJA1 in DVT mice.              Conclusion:                    miR-206 knockdown upregulates GJA1 to inhibit autophagy of EPCs and then promote EPC proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, thereby enhancing EPC homing to thrombi and facilitating thrombus resolution.",-1
Screening for Viruses and Lemur-Associated Filara in Wild-Caught Mosquitoes From Madagascar,"Madagascar is a hotspot of biodiversity, but poverty and population growth provoke a high risk of conflict between food security and biodiversity conservation in this tropical country. Numerous vector-borne diseases, including viral infections, affect public health in Madagascar and a continuous expansion of anthropogenically used areas intensifies contact on the human-wildlife interface. However, data on human and animal pathogens in potential insect vectors is limited. Therefore, we conducted a parasitological and virological survey of 785 adult female mosquitoes between March and May 2016 at the Ankarafantsika National Park in northwestern Madagascar. Screening included Alpha-, Phlebo-, and Flaviviridae and the recently described filarial nematode species, Lemurfilaria lemuris. The predominant mosquito genus was Culex (91%), followed by Mansonia (4.1%), Anopheles (3.4%), and Aedes (0.9%). Viral screening revealed no arboviruses, but an insect-specific flavivirus in two Culex sitiens pools. No pools screened positive for the lemur-specific filarial nematode L. lemuris.",-1
"Subcutaneous fat mass in infancy and abdominal, pericardial and liver fat assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging at the age of 10 years","Background/objectives:                    Fat mass development in infancy contributes to later adiposity, but its relation to ectopic fat depots is unknown. We examined the associations of infant subcutaneous fat with childhood general and organ-specific fat.              Subjects/methods:                    Among 593 children from a population-based prospective cohort study, we obtained total subcutaneous fat mass (as sum of biceps, triceps, suprailiacal, and subscapular skinfolds thickness), central-to-total subcutaneous fat ratio (sum of suprailiacal and subscapular skinfold thickness/total subcutaneous fat) at 1.5, 6 and 24 months of age. At 10 years, we assessed BMI, fat mass index (FMI) based on total body fat by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and abdominal subcutaneous, visceral and pericardial fat mass indices, and liver fat fraction by Magnetic Resonance Imaging.              Results:                    A higher central-to-total subcutaneous fat ratio at 1.5 months only and higher total subcutaneous fat at 6 and 24 months were associated with higher BMI, FMI and subcutaneous fat mass index at 10 years. The observed associations were the strongest between total subcutaneous fat at 24 months and these childhood outcomes (difference per 1-SDS increase in total subcutaneous fat: 0.15 SDS (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08, 0.23), 0.17 SDS (95% CI 0.10, 0.24), 0.16 SDS (95% CI 0.08, 0.23) for BMI, FMI and childhood subcutaneous fat mass index, respectively). Infant subcutaneous fat measures at any time point were not associated with visceral and pericardial fat mass indices, and liver fat fraction at 10 years.              Conclusions:                    Our results suggest that infant subcutaneous fat is associated with later childhood abdominal subcutaneous fat and general adiposity, but not with other organ-specific fat depots.",-1
Evaluation of metformin performance on alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits,"This study aimed to evaluate metformin as a widely used oral hypoglycemic agent and identify the effects on biochemical and antioxidant body systems of rabbits. Four groups of rabbits were randomly allocated as the control, the alloxan-induced diabetic, metformin-treated, and alloxan treated with metformin. The results revealed that alloxan leads to significant elevation in glucose (Glc) levels, malondialdehyde (MDA), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TCH), and a significant decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and glutathione (GSH) as compared with the control group. Metformin alone caused a significant decline in Glc and HDL with significant elevation in LDL and MDA without significant changes in TCH, TGs, VLDL, and GSH. When metformin was offered as a treatment for alloxan-induced diabetic animals, it caused a significant decline in Glc, TCH, TGs, LDL, and VLDL levels with significant elevation in GSH and without a significant change in HDL and MDA. Metformin causes a decline in glucose levels due to its ability to decrease the use of substances hepatic cells use to create glucose and its ability to induce the enzymes participating in glucose oxidation.",-1
DA-9805 protects dopaminergic neurons from endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease with damages to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by neuroinflammation. We previously reported that a triple herbal extract DA-9805 in experimental PD toxin-models had neuroprotective effects by alleviating mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated whether DA-9805 could suppress ER stress and neuroinflammation in vitro and/or in vivo. Pre-treatment with DA-9805 (1 Î¼g/ml) attenuated upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase-3 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with thapsigargin (1 Âµg/ml) or tunicamycin (2 Âµg/ml). In addition, DA-9805 prevented the production of IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î± and nitric oxide through inhibition of NF-ÎºB activation in BV2 microglial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg) into mice can induce acute neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuronal cell death. Oral administration of DA-9805 (10 or 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days before LPS injection) prevented loss of dopaminergic neurons and activation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra in LPS-injected mouse models. Taken together, these results indicate that DA-9805 can effectively prevent ER stress and neuroinflammation, suggesting that DA-9805 is a multitargeting and disease-modifying therapeutic candidate for PD.",-1
Care vs Food as an Emotional Regulation Strategy in Elementary School Children: The Role of the Attachment Style,"According to attachment theory, potentially threatening stimuli tend to activate the attachment system for the search of the protective figure. In secure attachments, the experience of responsive relationships increases the probability of resorting to available figures as a strategy for regulating emotions in stressful situations. The aim of the research was to verify whether, in conditions of mild threat, children's attachment styles affect the choice between caring relationships and food as a form of emotion regulation. We used a mixed experimental design to perform this research. Here, we presented children (N = 65; Mage= 9.4) with threatening and neutral images and, afterwards, asked them to select from images of caring relationship or images of food. The results indicate that securely and ambivalently attached but not avoidantly attached children under both the neutral and threatening image conditions chose the care pictures over the food pictures. Second, only the securely attached increased their choice of care over food images in the threatening condition, and third, this difference was significant when compared with the avoidant children. In conclusion, the results show that although in general the choice of care is primary with respect to food, children with insecure attachments differ from secure children between the two options of emotional regulation.",-1
Combination Strategies Involving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Tyrosine Kinase or BRAF Inhibitors in Aggressive Thyroid Cancer,"Thyroid cancer is the most common (~90%) type of endocrine-system tumor, accounting for 70% of the deaths from endocrine cancers. In the last years, the high-throughput genomics has been able to identify pathways/molecular targets involved in survival and tumor progression. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy individually have many limitations. Regarding the first one, although it greatly reduces the size of the cancer, clinical responses are generally transient and often lead to cancer relapse after initial treatment. For the second one, although it induces longer-lasting responses in cancer patients than targeted therapy, its response rate is lower. The individual limitations of these two different types of therapies can be overcome by combining them. Here, we discuss MAPK pathway inhibitors, i.e., BRAF and MEK inhibitors, combined with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Several mutations make tumors resistant to treatments. Therefore, more studies are needed to investigate the patient's individual tumor mutation burden in order to overcome the problem of resistance to therapy and to develop new combination therapies.",-1
"A Challenge for a Unique Dengue Vector Control Programme: Assessment of the Spatial Variation of Insecticide Resistance Status amongst Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus Populations in Gampaha District, Sri Lanka","Background:                    To date, dengue is considered an important public health problem in Sri Lanka. Irrational use of insecticides without evidence-based applications has primed the development of resistance in mosquito vectors.              Method:                    The present study investigated the resistance status of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus to commonly used insecticides in three selected Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas (i.e., Attanagalla, Dompe, and Negombo) in Gampaha District, Western Province of Sri Lanka. Entomological surveys were performed using ovitraps and larval collections. Larval bioassays were carried out to determine the LC50, LC90, and LC95 and susceptibility status for organophosphate temephos, whereas adult bioassays were performed to test the 0.03% deltamethrin and 0.8% malathion susceptibility.              Results:                    The study revealed that the temephos concentrations required to control Ae. aegypti (13.7-17.7 times) and Ae. albopictus (4.6-7.6 times) are higher than the diagnostic concentration (0.012 mg/L) proposed by the World Health Organization. The highest resistance levels were observed for both Ae. aegypti (14 Â± 1.87) and Ae. albopictus (36 Â± 1.87) collected from the Negombo MOH area. Therefore, the WHO recommended diagnostic concentration is no longer effective in controlling Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae in these areas. Both the dengue vectors have evolved a high level of insecticide resistance to malathion and deltamethrin in the Gampaha District except Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in rural areas. Further, vectors in rural areas are indicated susceptible (>98%) to pyrethroids and emergence of resistance (<97%) for organophosphate insecticides.              Conclusion:                    The results of this study warrant the vector management authorities on the proper application of insecticides and rational use in vector control. The susceptibility status of vector mosquitoes should be continuously monitored especially in dengue-endemic areas parallel to the routine surveillance programme. Further molecular studies are strongly recommended to determine the Knockdown Resistance (kdr) mutations among Aedes populations.",-1
Aging and Positive Mood: Longitudinal Neurobiological and Cognitive Correlates,"Objective:                    Despite the losses commonly associated with aging, older adults seem to possess particularly preserved emotional regulation. To further understand this phenomenon, the authors examined longitudinal trajectories between age, depressive symptoms, brain structure, and cognition.              Methods:                    Seven hundred and sixteen functionally intact older adults (age M = 67.9, 56.8% female), followed longitudinally (visit range: 1-13, M = 2.5), completed cognitive testing and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). A subset (N = 327) underwent 3T brain MRI. Mixed-effects linear regression models were conducted controlling for sex, education, and total intracranial volume.              Results:                    There was a significant interaction between age and time on GDS, such that GDS improved with increasing age over time, but attenuated around age 71 (age*time b = 0.10, p <0.001). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity interacted with age to predict longitudinal changes in GDS (FA: b = -0.02, p = 0.01; MD: b = 0.03, p = 0.007), such that age-related benefits on GDS were attenuated in those with declining FA. Executive function (EF) and processing speed also interacted with age to predict longitudinal changes in GDS (EF: b = -0.04, p = 0.03; speed: b = 0.04, p = 0.04). Again, the positive effect of age on GDS attenuated in those with worsening EF and speed. There were no associations with memory, semantic fluency, or gray matter (p values >0.05).              Conclusion:                    EF, processing speed, and white matter integrity moderated the longitudinal relationship between age and mood. Previous studies demonstrate the link between positivity and better cognitive control, leading to improved mood in older adults. Our results are not only consistent, but establish a potential neurobiological correlate. Future research further exploring biological mechanisms driving psychological processes may have important therapeutic implications.",-1
Polymorphism rs3742330 in microRNA Biogenesis Gene DICER1 Is Associated with Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma in Saudi Cohort,"We investigated the association between DICER1 (rs3742330) and DROSHA (rs10719) polymorphisms and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXG) and related clinical phenotypes in a Saudi cohort. In a retrospective case-control study, TaqMan real-time, PCR-based genotyping was performed in 340 participants with 246 controls and 94 PXG cases. The minor (G) allele frequency of rs3742330 in PXG (0.03) was significantly different from that in the controls (0.08) and protective against PXG (odds ratio (OR) = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.16-0.92), p = 0.017). Similarly, the rs3742330 genotypes showed a significant protective association with PXG in dominant (p = 0.019, OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.15-0.92), over-dominant (p = 0.024, OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.16-0.95), and log-additive models (p = 0.017, OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.16-0.92). However, none remained significant after an adjustment for age, sex, and multiple testing. Rs10719 in DROSHA did not show any significant allelic or genotype association with PXG. However, a protective effect of the GA haplotype in DICER1 and DROSHA and PXG (p = 0.034) was observed. Both polymorphisms showed no significant effect on intraocular pressure and the cup-disk ratio. In conclusion, we report a significant genetic association between variant rs3742330 in DICER1, a gene involved in miRNA biogenesis, and PXG. Further investigation in a larger group of patients of different ethnicities and functional studies are warranted to replicate and validate its potential role in PXG.",-1
Transcriptome Profiling Reveals Role of MicroRNAs and Their Targeted Genes during Adventitious Root Formation in Dark-Pretreated Micro-Shoot Cuttings of Tetraploid Robinia pseudoacacia L,"Tetraploid Robinia pseudoacacia L. is a difficult-to-root species, and is vegetatively propagated through stem cuttings. Limited information is available regarding the adventitious root (AR) formation of dark-pretreated micro-shoot cuttings. Moreover, the role of specific miRNAs and their targeted genes during dark-pretreated AR formation under in vitro conditions has never been revealed. The dark pretreatment has successfully promoted and stimulated adventitious rooting signaling-related genes in tissue-cultured stem cuttings with the application of auxin (0.2 mg L-1 IBA). Histological analysis was performed for AR formation at 0, 12, 36, 48, and 72 h after excision (HAE) of the cuttings. The first histological events were observed at 36 HAE in the dark-pretreated cuttings; however, no cellular activities were observed in the control cuttings. In addition, the present study aimed to uncover the role of differentially expressed (DE) microRNAs (miRNAs) and their targeted genes during adventitious root formation using the lower portion (1-1.5 cm) of tetraploid R. pseudoacacia L. micro-shoot cuttings. The samples were analyzed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology for the identification of miRNAs at the mentioned time points. Seven DE miRNA libraries were constructed and sequenced. The DE number of 81, 162, 153, 154, 41, 9, and 77 miRNAs were upregulated, whereas 67, 98, 84, 116, 19, 16, and 93 miRNAs were downregulated in the following comparisons of the libraries: 0-vs-12, 0-vs-36, 0-vs-48, 0-vs-72, 12-vs-36, 36-vs-48, and 48-vs-72, respectively. Furthermore, we depicted an association between ten miRNAs (novel-m0778-3p, miR6135e.2-5p, miR477-3p, miR4416c-5p, miR946d, miR398b, miR389a-3p, novel m0068-5p, novel-m0650-3p, and novel-m0560-3p) and important target genes (auxin response factor-3, gretchen hagen-9, scarecrow-like-1, squamosa promoter-binding protein-like-12, small auxin upregulated RNA-70, binding protein-9, vacuolar invertase-1, starch synthase-3, sucrose synthase-3, probable starch synthase-3, cell wall invertase-4, and trehalose phosphatase synthase-5), all of which play a role in plant hormone signaling and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the relative expression of these miRNAs and their targeted genes. These results provide novel insights and a foundation for further studies to elucidate the molecular factors and processes controlling AR formation in woody plants.",-1
Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism: Clinicopathological discrepancies on diagnosis in three patients,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. The cardinal neuropathological features of PD include selective and progressive loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra, deficiencies in dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, and occurrence of phosphorylated Î±-synuclein-identified Lewy bodies in the nervous system. Parkinsonism, the clinical presentation of movement disorders seen in PD, is a feature shared commonly by other pathologically distinct neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish PD from such parkinsonism-related neurological disorders. In addition, parkinsonism is not always a feature of certain neurodegenerative diseases, and it can sometimes develop as a result of various forms of drug intoxication or cerebrovascular disease. Here, we describe the clinicopathological features of three patients (cases 1, 2, and 3) diagnosed as having PSP, MSA, and PD, respectively, in each of whom the postmortem histopathological diagnosis differed from the final clinical diagnosis. Neuropathologically, they had suffered from coexistent disorders: PD, MSA, and argyrophilic grain disease (case 1); PD (case 2); and vascular parkinsonism (case 3). The variety of patients showing features of parkinsonism underlines the importance of careful long-term follow up followed by postmortem neuropathological evaluation.",-1
Multilabel classification of medical concepts for patient clinical profile identification,"Background:                    The development of electronic health records has provided a large volume of unstructured biomedical information. Extracting patient characteristics from these data has become a major challenge, especially in languages other than English.              Methods:                    Inspired by the French Text Mining Challenge (DEFT 2021) [1] in which we participated, our study proposes a multilabel classification of clinical narratives, allowing us to automatically extract the main features of a patient report. Our system is an end-to-end pipeline from raw text to labels with two main steps: named entity recognition and multilabel classification. Both steps are based on a neural network architecture based on transformers. To train our final classifier, we extended the dataset with all English and French Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) vocabularies related to human diseases. We focus our study on the multilingualism of training resources and models, with experiments combining French and English in different ways (multilingual embeddings or translation).              Results:                    We obtained an overall average micro-F1 score of 0.811 for the multilingual version, 0.807 for the French-only version and 0.797 for the translated version.              Conclusion:                    Our study proposes an original multilabel classification of French clinical notes for patient phenotyping. We show that a multilingual algorithm trained on annotated real clinical notes and UMLS vocabularies leads to the best results.",-1
Evidence of antagonistic predictive effects of miRNAs in breast cancer cohorts through data-driven networks,"Non-coding micro RNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation seems to play an important role in the pathways involved in breast cancer occurrence and progression. In different studies, opposite functions may be assigned to the same miRNA, either promoting the disease or protecting from it. Our research tackles the following issues: (i) why aren't there any concordant findings in many research studies regarding the role of miRNAs in the progression of breast cancer? (ii) could a miRNA have either an activating effect or an inhibiting one in cancer progression according to the other miRNAs with which it interacts? For this purpose, we analyse the AHUS dataset made available on the ArrayExpress platform by Haakensen et al. The breast tissue specimens were collected over 7 years between 2003 and 2009. miRNA-expression profiling was obtained for 55 invasive carcinomas and 70 normal breast tissue samples. Our statistical analysis is based on a recently developed model and feature selection technique which, instead of selecting a single model (i.e. a unique combination of miRNAs), delivers a set of models with equivalent predictive capabilities that allows to interpret and visualize the interaction of these features. As a result, we discover a set of 112 indistinguishable models (in a predictive sense) each with 4 or 5 miRNAs. Within this set, by comparing the model coefficients, we are able to identify three classes of miRNA: (i) oncogenic miRNAs; (ii) protective miRNAs; (iii) undefined miRNAs which can play both an oncogenic and a protective role according to the network with which they interact. These results shed new light on the biological action of miRNAs in breast cancer and may contribute to explain why, in some cases, different studies attribute opposite functions to the same miRNA.",-1
Associations between adherence to the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and six glucose homeostasis traits in the Microbiome and Insulin Longitudinal Evaluation Study (MILES),"Background and aims:                    The DASH diet conveys protection against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) Via plant-based and non-plant-based recommendations. Research has not identified which glucose homeostasis pathways are improved. We examined associations between adherence to a DASH diet and six glucose homeostasis traits, probing whether associations could be attributed to the plant-based (DASH-P) and/or non-plant based (DASH-NP) components.              Methods and results:                    We included data from 295 adults without T2D (age 59.3 Â± 9.00 years; 63.46% non-Hispanic White and 36.54% African American, self-reported race ancestry) participating in the Microbiome and Insulin Longitudinal Evaluation Study (MILES). An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) yielded fasting plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and insulin secretion, sensitivity, and disposition index. Habitual dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Associations between DASH components and glucose homeostasis traits were examined, controlling for demographics, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and energy intake. For significant associations, the models were repeated with scores for DASH-P and DASH-NP as predictors in the same model. DASH and DASH-P scores were inversely associated with fasting plasma glucose (DASH:Î² = -0.036 Â± 0.012,P = 0.005; DASH-P: Î² = -0.04 Â± 0.017,P = 0.002), and positively associated with insulin sensitivity (DASH:Î² = 0.022 Â± 0.012,P = 0.042; DASH-P: = 0.036 Â± 0.015,P = 0.014). The DASH score was also associated with disposition index (Î² = 0.026 Â± 0.013,P = 0.038), but this association did not reach significance with DASH-P (Î² = 0.035 Â± 0.018,P = 0.051). No associations were observed with DASH-NP score (all P > 0.05).              Conclusions:                    DASH diet is associated with improvement in specific glucose homeostasis traits, likely arising from increased plant-based foods. Such research may help tailor future dietary advice to specific metabolic risk, and to food groups most effective at improving these.",-1
Cyber Risk Recommendation System for Digital Education Management Platforms,"Covid-19 pandemic has ushered in a new school and academic year for students in a distance learning regime. This new daily routine was unprecedented and undoubtedly unusual, especially for the younger ones. At this point and at these ages, the risk of cyber fraud is even greater. The transition from the physical environment to the Internet took place quickly without the appropriate time to control potential risks and the proper information and training of teachers and students. Some common threats that need to be addressed to protect learners and their data when using e-learning methods are malicious remote access, malware, phishing, cyber fraud, etc. Considering the above situation, this work presents an innovative cyber risk recommendation system for digital education management platforms. The system in question is a distributed two-stage algorithm based on game theory and machine learning, which is trained by the constant change in the choice of recommendations by users to maximize security. We examine the algorithm's ability to simulate a user system in which everyone independently selects a user recommendation, assesses the environment and the implications of this choice, and then concludes whether it will continue to have that recommendation fixed. The methodology with which we have represented the digital e-learning system has been done with an approach that directly corresponds with their general view as a cyber-physical-social system. We consider the digital school as an environment that brings limitations, leading us to a pretty demanding personalization problem. Users coexist in this environment, in which everyone acts voluntarily but influences and is influenced by the surrounding environment. Our results lead us to conclude that this algorithm responds in a fully effective, flexible, and efficient way to the needs of protection and risk assessment of e-learning education systems.",-1
"Suppressed expression of oxidoreductin-like protein, Oxidor, increases follicle degeneration and decreases survival during the overwintering diapause of the mosquito Culex pipiens","Throughout diapause in mosquitoes, stress resistance and subsequent prolonged lifespan are a few important features of diapause that are crucial for overwintering success. In the mosquito Culex pipiens, we suggest that oxidoreductin-like protein is involved with these diapause characteristics for overwintering survival. Expression of oxidor was more than two-fold higher in early stage diapausing females compared to their non-diapausing counterparts. Suppression of the gene that encodes oxidoreductin-like protein by RNAi significantly increased the proportion of degenerating follicles in early-stage adult diapausing females. Inhibition of oxidor also significantly reduced the survivability of diapausing females which indicates that this protein plays a key role in protecting multiple tissues during early diapause.",-1
ACT001 attenuates microglia-mediated neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury via inhibiting AKT/NFÎºB/NLRP3 pathway,"Background:                    Microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response following traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered as a vital secondary injury factor, which drives trauma-induced neurodegeneration and is lack of efficient treatment. ACT001, a sesquiterpene lactone derivative, is reportedly involved in alleviation of inflammatory response. However, little is known regarding its function in regulating innate immune response of central nervous system (CNS) after TBI. This study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of ACT001 in TBI.              Methods:                    Controlled cortical impact (CCI) models were used to establish model of TBI. Cresyl violet staining, evans blue extravasation, neurobehavioral function assessments, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate therapeutic effects of ACT001 in vivo. Microglial depletion was induced by administering mice with colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622. Cell-cell interaction models were established as co-culture system to simulate TBI conditions in vitro. Cytotoxic effect of ACT001 on cell viability was assessed by cell counting kit-8 and activation of microglia cells were induced by Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Pro-inflammatory cytokines expression was determined by Real-time PCR and nitric oxide production. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL and flow cytometry assays. Tube formation was performed to evaluate cellular angiogenic ability. ELISA and western blot experiments were used to determine proteins expression. Pull-down assay was used to analyze proteins that bound ACT001.              Results:                    ACT001 relieved the extent of blood-brain barrier integrity damage and alleviated motor function deficits after TBI via reducing trauma-induced activation of microglia cells. Delayed depletion of microglia with PLX5622 hindered therapeutic effect of ACT001. Furthermore, ACT001 alleviated LPS-induced activation in mouse and rat primary microglia cells. Besides, ACT001 was effective in suppressing LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production in BV2 cells, resulting in reduction of neuronal apoptosis in HT22 cells and improvement of tube formation in bEnd.3 cells. Mechanism by which ACT001 functioned was related to AKT/NFÎºB/NLRP3 pathway. ACT001 restrained NFÎºB nuclear translocation in microglia cells through inhibiting AKT phosphorylation, resulting in decrease of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and finally down-regulated microglial neuroinflammatory response.              Conclusions:                    Our study indicated that ACT001 played critical role in microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response and might be a novel potential chemotherapeutic drug for TBI.

CircACTR2 in macrophages promotes renal fibrosis by activating macrophage inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of renal tubular epithelial cells,"The crosstalk between macrophages and tubular epithelial cells (TECs) actively regulates the progression of renal fibrosis. In the present study, we revealed the significance of circular RNA ACTR2 (circACTR2) in regulating macrophage inflammation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TECs, and the development of renal fibrosis. Our results showed UUO-induced renal fibrosis was associated with increased inflammation and EMT, hypertrophy of contralateral kidney, up-regulations of circACTR2 and NLRP3, and the down-regulation of miR-561. CircACTR2 sufficiently and essentially promoted the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptosis, and inflammation in macrophages, and through paracrine effect, stimulated EMT and fibrosis of TECs. Mechanistically, circACTR2 sponged miR-561 and up-regulated NLRP3 expression level to induce the secretion of IL-1Î². In TECs, IL-1Î² induced renal fibrosis via up-regulating fascin-1. Knocking down circACTR2 or elevating miR-561 potently alleviated renal fibrosis in vivo. In summary, circACTR2, by sponging miR-561, activated NLRP3 inflammasome, promoted macrophage inflammation, and stimulated macrophage-induced EMT and fibrosis of TECs. Knocking down circACTR2 and overexpressing miR-561 may, thus, benefit the treatment of renal fibrosis.",-1
Effects of radiotherapy and short-term starvation combination on metastatic and non-tumor cell lines,"Background:                    Since its discovery in the late 19th century, radiotherapy has been one of the most important medical treatments in oncology. Recently, fasting or short-term starvation (STS) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy has been studied to determine its potential for enhancing the therapeutic index and for preventing side- effects, but no data are available in the radiotherapy setting. We thus decided to investigate the effects in vitro of STS in combination with radiotherapy in metastatic cancer cells and non-cancer cells.              Methods:                    Cells were incubated in short-term starvation medium (STS medium, 0Â·5 g/L glucose + 1% FBS) or in control medium (CM medium, 1 g/L glucose + 10 % FBS) for 24 h and then treated with single high-dose radiation. A plexiglass custom-built phantom was used to irradiate cells. DNA damage was evaluated using alkaline comet assay and theCometAnalyser software. The cell surviving fraction was assessed by clonogenic assay.              Finding:                    STS followed by single high-dose radiation significantly increased DNA damage in metastatic cancer cell lines but not in normal cells. Furthermore, STS reduced the surviving fraction of irradiated tumor cells, indicating a good radio-sensitizing effect on metastatic cell lines. This effect was not observed in non-tumor cells.              Interpretation:                    Our results suggest that STS may alter cellular processes, enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy in metastatic cancer cellsin vitro. Interestingly, STS has radioprotective effect on the survival of healthy cells.",-1
Plastid retrograde regulation of miRNA expression in response to light stress,"Background:                    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous noncoding RNAs that play a pivotal role in the regulation of plant development and responses to the surrounding environment. Despite the efforts made to elucidate their function in the adaptation of plants to many abiotic and biotic stresses, their role in high light (HL) stress is still vague. HL stress often arises upon plant exposure to full sunlight. Subsequent changes in nuclear gene expression are triggered by chloroplast-derived retrograde signals.              Results:                    In this study, we show that HL is involved in miRNA-dependent regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes. Microtranscriptomic screening revealed a limited number of miRNAs reacting to HL. To explain the miRNA regulation mechanisms at the different biogenesis stages, chemical and genetic approaches were applied. First, we tested the possible role of plastoquinone (PQ) redox changes using photosynthetic electron transport chain inhibitors. The results suggest that increased primary transcript abundance (pri-miRNAs) of HL-regulated miRNAs is dependent on signals upstream of PQ. This indicates that such signals may originate from photosystem II, which is the main singlet oxygen (1O2) source. Nevertheless, no changes in pri-miRNA expression upon a dark-light shift in the conditional fluorescent (flu) mutant producing 1O2 were observed when compared to wild-type plants. Thus, we explored the 1O2 signaling pathway, which is initiated independently in HL and is related to Î²-carotene oxidation and production of volatile derivatives, such as Î²-cyclocitral (Î²-CC). Pri-miRNA induction by Î²-CC, which is a component of this 1O2 pathway, as well as an altered response in the methylene blue sensitivity 1 (mbs1) mutant support the role of 1O2 signaling in miRNA regulation.              Conclusions:                    We show that light stress triggers changes in miRNA expression. This stress response may be regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related signaling. In conclusion, our results link ROS action to miRNA biogenesis, suggesting its contribution to inconsistent pri- and mature miRNA dynamics.",-1
An Entity Relationship Extraction Model Based on BERT-BLSTM-CRF for Food Safety Domain,"Dealing with food safety issues in time through online public opinion incidents can reduce the impact of incidents and protect human health effectively. Therefore, by the smart technology of extracting the entity relationship of public opinion events in the food field, the knowledge graph of the food safety field is constructed to discover the relationship between food safety issues. To solve the problem of multi-entity relationships in food safety incident sentences for few-shot learning, this paper adopts the pipeline-type extraction method. Entity relationship is extracted from Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERTs) joined Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM), namely, the BERT-BLSTM network model. Based on the entity relationship types extracted from the BERT-BLSTM model and the introduction of Chinese character features, an entity pair extraction model based on the BERT-BLSTM-conditional random field (CRF) is established. In this paper, several common deep neural network models are compared with the BERT-BLSTM-CRF model with a food public opinion events dataset. Experimental results show that the precision of the entity relationship extraction model based on BERT-BLSTM-CRF is 3.29%â?3.25% higher than that of other models in the food public opinion events dataset, which verifies the validity and rationality of the model proposed in this paper.",-1
Gga-miR-30c-5p Enhances Apoptosis in Fowl Adenovirus Serotype 4-Infected Leghorn Male Hepatocellular Cells and Facilitates Viral Replication through Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1,"Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the primary causative agent responsible for the hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) in chickens, leading to considerable economic losses to stakeholders. Although the pathogenesis of FAdV-4 infection has gained attention, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we showed that the ectopic expression of gga-miR-30c-5p in leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells enhanced apoptosis in FAdV-4-infected LMH cells by directly targeting the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), facilitating viral replication. On the contrary, the inhibition of endogenous gga-miR-30c-5p markedly suppressed apoptosis and viral replication in LMH cells. Importantly, the overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited gga-miR-30c-5p or FAdV-4-induced apoptosis in LMH cells, reducing FAdV-4 replication, while the knockdown of Mcl-1 by RNAi enhanced apoptosis in LMH cells. Furthermore, transfection of LMH cells with gga-miR-30c-5p mimics enhanced FAdV-4-induced apoptosis associated with increased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Thus, gga-miR-30c-5p enhances FAdV-4-induced apoptosis by directly targeting Mcl-1, a cellular anti-apoptotic protein, facilitating FAdV-4 replication in host cells. These findings could help to unravel the mechanism of how a host responds against FAdV-4 infection at an RNA level.",-1
A Research on the Realization Algorithm of Internet of Things Function for Smart Education,"The traditional teaching mode is to use a point-to-point mode or a computer-aided system for teaching, but this limits students' enthusiasm and interest in learning. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology is a technology that integrates sensors, the Internet, and terminals to transmit information in real time. The smart education based on the Internet of Things can realize remote teaching and actual scene teaching, and students can freely choose the learning location and time, which can greatly improve students learning interest and learning efficiency, which is a development trend of a new teaching method. Smart IoT teaching is a teaching method that combines IoT technology and artificial intelligence technology. This paper mainly studies the research and analysis of the smart education model based on the IoT in remote teaching. In this paper, sensor technologies such as cameras will be used to collect students' expressions, speech, and other actions in class from different regions. These data features will be processed by the terminal's intelligent algorithm, and the desired knowledge will be obtained according to the students' behavior information. The information processed by the intelligent algorithm will be transmitted to the terminal system where the teacher is located, such as computer and mobile phone. This paper focuses on analyzing the reliability and accuracy of the intelligent algorithm of the IoT smart education terminal. The results show that the prediction error of the student behavior information is within 3% and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.99.",-1
Diagnostic performance for detecting bone marrow edema of the hip on dual-energy CT: Deep learning model vs. musculoskeletal physicians and radiologists,"Purpose:                    To compare the diagnostic performance of a deep learning (DL) model with that of musculoskeletal physicians and radiologists for detecting bone marrow edema on dual-energy CT (DECT).              Method:                    This retrospective study included adult patients underwent hip DECT and MRI within 1 month between April 2018 and December 2020. A total of 8709 DECT images were divided into training/validation (85%, 7412 augmented images) and test (15%, 1297 images) sets. The images were labeled as present/absent bone marrow edema, with MRI as reference standard. We developed and trained a DL model to detect bone marrow edema from DECT images. Thereafter, DL model, two orthopedic surgeons, and three radiologists evaluated the presence of bone marrow edema on every test image. The diagnostic performance of the DL model and readers was compared. Inter-reader agreement was calculated using Fleiss-kappa statistics.              Results:                    A total of 73 patients (mean age, 59 Â± 12 years; 38 female) were included. The DL model had a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC, 0.84 vs. 0.61-0.70, p < 0.001) and sensitivity (79% vs. 29-66%) without loss of specificity (90% vs. 74-93%) than the non- or less-experienced readers and similar to the trained reader (AUC, 0.83, p = 0.402; sensitivity, 71%; specificity, 94%). Additionally, AUCs were strongly dependent on the reader's DECT experience. Inter-reader agreement was fair (Îº = 0.303).              Conclusion:                    The DL model showed better diagnostic performance than less-experienced physicians in detecting bone marrow edema on DECT and comparable performance to a trained radiologist.",-1
"Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and its relation with pro-inflammatory mediators, visceral adiposity and carotid intima-media thickness in population with obesity","Background:                    Atherosclerosis represents a cardiovascular risk. Chronic inflammation is a key factor for atherogenic progression. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been proposed as a novel biomarker for cardiovascular risks. We aimed to explore whether NLR was related to surrogate pro-atherogenic promoters driving atherogenic progression, as measured by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT).              Study design:                    Thirty-one patients with obesity candidates for bariatric surgery were recruited from Centro MÃ©dico Nacional ""20 de Noviembre"", ISSSTE, Mexico City. The results are part of the ""CROP"" study (NCT03561987). NLR was calculated from routine complete blood count, and its relation with plasma pro-inflammatory mediators (hsCRP, TNF-Î± and IL-1Î²), adipokines (adiponectin and leptin), adiposity markers (visceral adipose tissue [VAT] determined from CT scan image and VAT individual adipocyte area at histological sample) and CIMT were determined.              Results:                    Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio correlated with hsCRP (Spearman's r = 0.70 [95% CI 0.46 to 0.85], P < 0.01), TNF-Î± (r = 0.69 [0.44 to 0.84], P < 0.0001) and adiponectin (r = -0.69 [-0.84 to -0.45], P < 0.03), as well as with VAT individual adipocyte area (r = 0.64 [0.37 to 0.81], P < 0.0001) and with VAT area (r = 0.43; [0.07 to 0.68], P < 0.01). Leptin and adiponectin showed further independent association with higher NLR (multivariate regression analysis OR 7.9 [95% CI 1.1 to 56.2] P = 0.03 and 0.1 [0.01 to 1.0] P = 0.05, respectively). Moreover, NLR distribution significantly varied between subgroups divided according to progressive CIMT (P = 0.05); whereas adiponectin and VAT adipocyte area associated with CIMT > 0.9 mm (univariate analysis OR 0.1 [0.01 to 1.0] P = 0.05 and 13.1 [1.4 to 126.3] P = 0.03, respectively).              Conclusion:                    Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was related to pro-inflammatory, adiposity biomarkers and progressive subclinical atherogenesis.",-1
Fucoxanthin Attenuates Free Fatty Acid-Induced Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease by Regulating Lipid Metabolism/Oxidative Stress/Inflammation via the AMPK/Nrf2/TLR4 Signaling Pathway,"Fucoxanthin, a xanthophyll carotenoid abundant in brown algae, is reported to have several biological functions, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor activities, in mice. We investigated the effects and mechanisms of fucoxanthin in the mixture oleate/palmitate = 2/1(FFA)-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cell model in this study. The results showed that the content of superoxide dismutase in the FFA group was 9.8 Â± 1.0 U/mgprot, while that in the fucoxanthin high-dose (H-Fx) group (2 Î¼g/mL) increased to 22.9 Â± 0.6 U/mgprot. The content of interleukin-1Î² in the FFA group was 89.3 Â± 3.6 ng/mL, while that in the H-Fx group was reduced to 53.8 Â± 2.8 ng/mL. The above results indicate that fucoxanthin could alleviate the FFA-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory levels in the liver cells. Oil red-O staining revealed visible protrusions and a significant decrease in the number of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of cells in the fucoxanthin group. These findings on the mechanisms of action suggest that fucoxanthin can repair FFA-induced NAFLD via the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2-mediated (Nrf2) signaling pathway, as well as by downregulating the expression of the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated (TLR4) signaling pathway. Fucoxanthin exhibited alleviating effects in the FFA-induced NAFLD model and could be explored as a potential anti-NAFLD substance.",-1
Salivary cortisol levels during Ramadan fasting in hydrocortisone-treated secondary adrenal insufficiency patients,"Objective:                    Patients with adrenal insufficiency have difficulties in fasting during the month of Ramadan with an increased risk of complications. Cortisol levels are unknown in these patients. The objective of this study was to assess the daily cortisol profile in hydrocortisone-treated patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) and healthy controls during a fasting day.              Methods:                    A cross-sectional matched case-control study on 50 hydrocortisone-treated SAI patients and 69 controls who are used to fast. Clinical and therapeutic data were collected. Five salivary samples for cortisol measurement were collected throughout a fasting day of the third week of Ramadan 2019.              Results:                    Salivary cortisol levels were significantly higher on awakening, at midnight and before the predawn meal in patients compared with controls. The circadian cortisol rhythm was disrupted in patients. The area under the salivary cortisol level versus time curve (AUC) was lower than the 2.5th percentile of the controls in one patient (2.5%) and higher than the 97.5th percentile in 23 patients (59%) who were considered overtreated. Age â?35 years was independently associated with overtreatment (adjusted odds ratio = 12.0; 95% CI (2.0-70.4); p = 0.006). Seven patients broke their fasting for a complication compared with no one of the controls (p = 0.001). No factor was associated with this risk.              Conclusions:                    Salivary cortisol levels were high in fasting hydrocortisone-treated SAI patients with a disruption of the circadian rhythm.",-1
Machine learning in predicting extracapsular extension (ECE) of prostate cancer with MRI: a protocol for a systematic literature review,"Introduction:                    In patients with prostate cancer (PCa), the detection of extracapsular extension (ECE) and seminal vesicle invasion is not only important for selecting the appropriate therapy but also for preoperative planning and patient prognosis. It is of paramount importance to stage PCa correctly before surgery, in order to achieve better surgical and outcome results. Over the last years, MRI has been incorporated in the classical prostate staging nomograms with clinical improvement accuracy in detecting ECE, but with variability between studies and radiologist's experience.              Methods and analysis:                    The research question, based on patient, index test, comparator, outcome and study design criteria, was the following: what is the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence algorithms for predicting ECE in PCa patients, when compared with that of histopathological results after radical prostatectomy. To answer this question, we will use databases (EMBASE, PUBMED, Web of Science and CENTRAL) to search for the different studies published in the literature and we use the QUADA tool to evaluate the quality of the research selection.              Ethics and dissemination:                    This systematic review does not require ethical approval. The results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-review journal, as a chapter of a doctoral thesis and through presentations at national and international conferences.

Four Cases of Desquamative Esophagitis Occurring after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,"We herein report four patients with desquamative esophagitis that developed one to nine days after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Three patients underwent allogeneic PBSCT for leukemia, and the other underwent autologous PBSCT for pineoblastoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed mucosal sloughing and fresh blood in the esophagus. Fasting and intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy in addition to blood transfusion improved the esophageal lesions within five to seven days in three patients. These cases indicate that desquamative esophagitis can occur in patients who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although blood transfusions may be required, it can be resolved within seven days.",-1
Post-COVID Complications after Pressure Ulcer Surgery in Patients with Spinal Cord Injury Associate with Creatine Kinase Upregulation in Adipose Tissue,"The risk of complications following surgical procedures is significantly increased in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the mechanisms underlying these correlations are not fully known. Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients who underwent reconstructive surgery for pressure ulcers (PUs) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were included in this study. The patient's postoperative progression was registered, and the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (s-WAT) surrounding the ulcers was analyzed by proteomic and immunohistochemical assays to identify the molecular/cellular signatures of impaired recovery. Patients with SCI and a COVID-19-positive diagnosis showed worse recovery and severe postoperative complications, requiring reintervention. Several proteins were upregulated in the adipose tissue of these patients. Among them, CKMT2 and CKM stood out, and CKM increased for up to 60 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis. Moreover, CKMT2 and CKM were largely found in MGCs within the s-WAT of COVID patients. Some of these proteins presented post-translational modifications and were targeted by autoantibodies in the serum of COVID patients. Overall, our results indicate that CKMT2, CKM, and the presence of MGCs in the adipose tissue surrounding PUs in post-COVID patients could be predictive biomarkers of postsurgical complications. These results suggest that the inflammatory response in adipose tissue may underlie the defective repair seen after surgery.",-1
Parkinson's Disease Modification Through Abl Kinase Inhibition: An Opportunity,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, with an estimated 5 000 000 cases worldwide. Historically characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, PD pathology is now known to be widespread and to affect serotonin, cholinergic and norepinephrine neurons as well as nerve cells in the olfactory system, cerebral hemisphere, brain stem, spinal cord, and peripheral autonomic nervous system. PD pathology is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded Î±-synuclein, which is thought to play a critical role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Animal models of PD suggest that activation of the Abelson tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) plays an essential role in the initiation and progression of Î±-synuclein pathology and neurodegeneration. These studies demonstrate that internalization of misfolded Î±-synuclein activates c-Abl, which phosphorylates Î±-synuclein and promotes Î±-synuclein pathology within the affected neurons. Additionally, c-Abl inactivates parkin, disrupting mitochondrial quality control and biogenesis, promoting neurodegeneration. Post-mortem studies of PD patients demonstrate increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylated Î±-synuclein, consistent with the activation of c-Abl in human disease. Although the c-Abl inhibitor nilotinib failed to demonstrate clinical benefit in two double-blind trials, novel c-Abl inhibitors have been developed that accumulate in the brain and may inhibit c-Abl at saturating levels. These novel inhibitors have demonstrated benefits in animal models of PD and have now entered clinical development. Here, we review the role of c-Abl in the neurodegenerative disease process and consider the translational potential of c-Abl inhibitors from model studies to disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease.

Proteomics and Metabolomics Profiling of Platelets and Plasma Mediators of Thrombo-Inflammation in Gestational Hypertension and Preeclampsia,"Platelets may be pivotal mediators of the thrombotic and coagulopathic complications of preeclampsia (PE), linking inflammation and thrombosis with endothelial and vascular dysfunction. Both PE and gestational hypertension (GH) fall within the spectrum of hypertensive complications of pregnancy, with GH being a risk factor for preeclampsia. However, it is unclear what biomarkers distinguish PE from GH. Using a discovery size cohort, we aimed to characterize specific plasma and platelet thrombo-inflammatory drivers indicative of PE and differentiate PE from GH. We performed multiplex immunoassays, platelet and plasma quantitative proteomics and metabolomics of PE patients, comparing with non-pregnant (NP), healthy pregnant controls (PC) and GH participants. The expression pattern of plasma proteins and metabolites in PE/GH platelets was distinct from that of NP and PC. Whilst procoagulation in PC may be fibrinogen driven, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors ITIH2 and ITIH3 are likely mediators of thrombo-inflammation in GH and PE, and fibronectin and S100A8/9 may be major procoagulant agonists in PE only. Also enriched in PE were CCL1 and CCL27 plasma cytokines, and the platelet leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 27 and 42 (LRRC27/42), whose effects on platelets were explored using STRING analysis. Through protein-protein interactions analysis, we generated a new hypothesis for platelets' contribution to the thrombo-inflammatory states of preeclampsia.",-1
"Effects of plant oils with different fatty acid composition on cardiovascular risk factors in moderately hypercholesteremic Chinese adults: a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-designed trial","Objectives:                    Plant oil for cooking typically provides 40% to 50% of dietary fat, 65% of linoleic acid, 44% of Î±-linolenic acid and 41% of oleic acid in the Chinese diet. However, the comparative effects of fatty acids derived from plant oil on cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese are still inconclusive. Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate whether cardiovascular risk factors are altered depending on various types of plant oils such as peanut oil rich in oleic acid, corn oil rich in linoleic acid, and blend oil fortified by Î±-linolenic acid.              Design:                    A randomized, double-blinded, parallel-designed trial.              Setting:                    The First and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.              Participants:                    A total of 251 volunteers with fasting blood total cholesterol between 5.13 and 8.00 mmol L-1 were enrolled.              Intervention:                    Volunteers received peanut oil, corn oil or blend oil to use for cooking for one year.              Main outcome measures:                    The erythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition, fasting plasma lipids, glucose and insulin concentrations and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were measured before, during and after the intervention. The level of Î±-linolenic acid in erythrocyte membranes was significantly increased in the blend oil group after the intervention (P < 0.001). The level of other fatty acids did not show any statistically significant differences between the three groups. No significant differences were observed in the concentrations of fasting plasma lipids, hsCRP, glucose, and insulin among the three groups using different types of plant oils.              Conclusions:                    The results suggest that although ingesting cooking oil with different fatty acid composition for one year could change erythrocyte membrane fatty acid compositions, it did not significantly modify cardiovascular risk factors in moderately hypercholesteremic people.",-1
"Impact of dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on serum levels of soluble dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in patients with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","Aims:                    Soluble dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (sDPP-4) is secreted by hepatocytes and induces adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can improve hepatic steatosis by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis. We investigated the effects of dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) on serum levels of sDPP-4 in patients with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).              Methods:                    Fifty-seven patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were randomized to a dapagliflozin group (5 mg/d for 24 weeks) (n = 33) or the control group (n = 24). Serum levels of sDPP-4 were measured with a commercial ELISA kit. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured by dual bioelectrical impedance analysis.              Results:                    In a total of 57 patients, baseline serum sDPP-4 was positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Î³-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and HOMA-IR Both VAT and SAT areas decreased significantly in the dapagliflozin group alone. Liver enzymes were decreased at 24 weeks in the dapagliflozin group, but were unchanged in the control group. Although both groups showed significant reduction of serum sDPP-4 after 24 weeks of treatment, the magnitude of decrease was significantly larger in the dapagliflozin group. Changes in liver enzymes during treatment with dapagliflozin were positively correlated with the change in serum sDPP-4, but not with changes in VAT volume or HbA1c.              Conclusions:                    Improvement of liver dysfunction after treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with a decrease in serum sDPP-4, suggesting that reduction of serum sDPP-4 by SGLT2 inhibitors may be a therapeutic strategy for NAFLD/NASH in patients with type 2 diabetes that is independent of glucose lowering or weight loss.",-1
The Combination of 'Benifuuki' with Quercetin Suppresses Hepatic Fat Accumulation in High-Fat High-Cholesterol Diet-Fed Rats,"We investigated the combined effects of 'Benifuuki,' a tea cultivar that contains O-methylated catechins like epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl) gallate, and quercetin on hepatic fat accumulation in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 15 d. Rats given 'Benifuuki'+quercetin had synergistically lower liver triglyceride (TG) level compared with rats given 'Benifuuki' or quercetin alone. Compared with 'Benifuuki' or quercetin alone, supplementation with 'Benifuuki'+quercetin resulted in a low level of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 (SCD1) gene expression levels. These results suggest that the combination of 'Benifuuki' and quercetin has greater liver lipid-lowing effects than that of 'Benifuuki' or quercetin alone. The liver TG-lowing effect of combination of 'Benifuuki' with quercetin may be partially mediated by the suppression of lipogenesis. The combination of 'Benifuuki' and quercetin suppresses hepatic fat accumulation in high fat high cholesterol diet fed rats, showing a new trend of 'Benifuuki' as synergist with quercetin.",-1
Normalized unitary synaptic signaling of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex predicted by deep learning of experimental recordings,"Biologically realistic computer simulations of neuronal circuits require systematic data-driven modeling of neuron type-specific synaptic activity. However, limited experimental yield, heterogeneous recordings conditions, and ambiguous neuronal identification have so far prevented the consistent characterization of synaptic signals for all connections of any neural system. We introduce a strategy to overcome these challenges and report a comprehensive synaptic quantification among all known neuron types of the hippocampal-entorhinal network. First, we reconstructed >2600 synaptic traces from â?200 publications into a unified computational representation of synaptic dynamics. We then trained a deep learning architecture with the resulting parameters, each annotated with detailed metadata such as recording method, solutions, and temperature. The model learned to predict the synaptic properties of all 3,120 circuit connections in arbitrary conditions with accuracy approaching the intrinsic experimental variability. Analysis of data normalized and completed with the deep learning model revealed that synaptic signals are controlled by few latent variables associated with specific molecular markers and interrelating conductance, decay time constant, and short-term plasticity. We freely release the tools and full dataset of unitary synaptic values in 32 covariate settings. Normalized synaptic data can be used in brain simulations, and to predict and test experimental hypothesis.",-1
Split BiRNN for real-time activity recognition using radar and deep learning,"Radar systems can be used to perform human activity recognition in a privacy preserving manner. This can be achieved by using Deep Neural Networks, which are able to effectively process the complex radar data. Often these networks are large and do not scale well when processing a large amount of radar streams at once, for example when monitoring multiple rooms in a hospital. This work presents a framework that splits the processing of data in two parts. First, a forward Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) calculation is performed on an on-premise device (usually close to the radar sensor) which already gives a prediction of what activity is performed, and can be used for time-sensitive use-cases. Next, a part of the calculation and the prediction is sent to a more capable off-premise machine (most likely in the cloud or a data center) where a backward RNN calculation is performed that improves the previous prediction sent by the on-premise device. This enables fast notifications to staff if troublesome activities occur (such as falling) by the on-premise device, while the off-premise device captures activities missed or misclassified by the on-premise device.",-1
Effects of Diet-Induced Weight Loss on Plasma Markers for Cholesterol Absorption and Synthesis: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Trial in Abdominally Obese Men,"Cross-sectional studies have shown that obesity is associated with lower intestinal cholesterol absorption and higher endogenous cholesterol synthesis. These metabolic characteristics have also been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, steatosis or cholestasis. The number of intervention studies evaluating the effect of weight loss on these metabolic characteristics is, however, limited, while the role of the different fat compartments has not been studied into detail. In a randomized trial, abdominally obese men (N = 54) followed a 6-week very low caloric (VLCD) diet, followed by a 2 week weight-maintenance period. Non-cholesterol sterols were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks, and compared to levels in lean participants (N = 25). After weight loss, total cholesterol (TC)-standardized cholestanol levels increased by 0.18 Âµmol/mmol (p &lt; 0.001), while those of campesterol and lathosterol decreased by 0.25 Âµmol/mmol (p &lt; 0.05) and 0.39 Âµmol/mmol (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. Moreover, after weight loss, TC-standardized lathosterol and cholestanol levels were comparable to those of lean men. Increases in TC-standardized cholestanol after weight loss were significantly associated with changes in waist circumference (p &lt; 0.01), weight (p &lt; 0.001), BMI (p &lt; 0.001) and visceral fat (p &lt; 0.01), but not with subcutaneous and intrahepatic lipids. In addition, cross-sectional analysis showed that visceral fat fully mediated the association between BMI and TC-standardized cholestanol levels. Intrahepatic lipid content was a partial mediator for the association between BMI and TC-standardized lathosterol levels. In conclusion, diet-induced weight loss decreased cholesterol synthesis and increased cholesterol absorption. The increase in TC-standardized cholestanol levels was not only related to weight loss, but also to a decrease in visceral fat volume. Whether these metabolic changes ameliorate other metabolic risk factors needs further study.",-1
"Targeting kinesin family member 21B by miR-132-3p represses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in gastric cancer","Recently, kinesin family member 21B (KIF21B) has been reported to be an oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the functional role of KIF21B and related molecular mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC) remain largely uncovered. In this study, online bioinformatics analysis showed that KIF21B was overexpression in GC and predicted poor prognosis. Consistently, we found that the protein expression of KIF21B was upregulated in GC tissues compared with adjacent tissues by immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of KIF21B significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in GC cell lines (AGS and SNU-5) using Cell counting kitâ? (CCK-8) assay, colony formation and transwell assay. KIF21B was confirmed as the target of miR-132-3p in GC cells by luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, miR-132-3p was down-regulated and KIF21B expression was upregulated in GC tissues. Overexpression of KIF21B reversed the miR-132-3p-mediated suppressive effects on GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, miR-132-3p overexpression downregulated the protein levels of Wnt1, c-Myc, Î²-catenin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and N-cadherin, and upregulated E-cadherin expression in GC cells, which were all alleviated after KIF21B overexpression. In conclusion, our findings indicate that down-regulation of KIF21B by miR-132-3p suppresses cellular functions in GC, which might be linked to reduced Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.",-1
Geographical and Tick-Dependent Distribution of Flavi-Like Alongshan and Yanggou Tick Viruses in Russia,"The genus Flavivirus includes related, unclassified segmented flavi-like viruses, two segments of which have homology with flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 and RNA helicase-protease NS3. This group includes such viruses as Jingmen tick virus, Alongshan virus, Yanggou tick virus and others. We detected the Yanggou tick virus in Dermacentor nuttalli and Dermacentor marginatus ticks in two neighbouring regions of Russia. The virus prevalence ranged from 0.5% to 8.0%. We detected RNA of the Alongshan virus in 44 individuals or pools of various tick species in eight regions of Russia. The virus prevalence ranged from 0.6% to 7.8%. We demonstrated the successful replication of the Yanggou tick virus and Alongshan virus in IRE/CTVM19 and HAE/CTVM8 tick cell lines without a cytopathic effect. According to the phylogenetic analysis, we divided the Alongshan virus into two groups: an Ixodes persulcatus group and an Ixodes ricinus group. In addition, the I. persulcatus group can be divided into European and Asian subgroups. We found amino acid signatures specific to the I. ricinus and I. persulcatus groups and also distinguished between the European and Asian subgroups of the I. persulcatus group.",-1
Interpretability and fairness evaluation of deep learning models on MIMIC-IV dataset,"The recent release of large-scale healthcare datasets has greatly propelled the research of data-driven deep learning models for healthcare applications. However, due to the nature of such deep black-boxed models, concerns about interpretability, fairness, and biases in healthcare scenarios where human lives are at stake call for a careful and thorough examination of both datasets and models. In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, and conduct comprehensive analyses of interpretability as well as dataset representation bias and prediction fairness of deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction. First, we analyze the interpretability of deep learning mortality prediction models and observe that (1) the best-performing interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models as well as recognizing new important features that domain knowledge does not consider; (2) prediction models rely on demographic features, raising concerns in fairness. Therefore, we then evaluate the fairness of models and do observe the unfairness: (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) models often rely on racial attributes unequally across subgroups to generate their predictions. We further draw concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors. Our analysis demonstrates that the prediction performance is not the only factor to consider when evaluating models for healthcare applications, since high prediction performance might be the result of unfair utilization of demographic features. Our findings suggest that future research in AI models for healthcare applications can benefit from utilizing the analysis workflow of interpretability and fairness as well as verifying if models achieve superior performance at the cost of introducing bias.",-1
Long-term changes in short-interval intracortical facilitation modulate motor cortex plasticity and L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    Abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission in the primary motor cortex (M1) contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology and is related to l-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). We previously showed that short-term treatment with safinamide, a monoamine oxidase type-B inhibitor with anti-glutamatergic properties, improves abnormally enhanced short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) in PD patients.              Objective:                    To examine whether a long-term SICF modulation has beneficial effects on clinical measures, including LID severity, and whether these changes parallel improvement in cortical plasticity mechanisms in PD.              Methods:                    We tested SICF in patients with and without LID before (S0) and after short- (14 days - S1) and long-term (12 months - S2) treatment with safinamide 100 mg/day. Possible changes in M1 plasticity were assessed using intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS). Finally, we correlated safinamide-related neurophysiological changes with modifications in clinical scores.              Results:                    SICF was enhanced at S0, and prominently in patients with LID. Safinamide normalized SICF at S1, and this effect persisted at S2. Impaired iTBS-induced plasticity was present at S0 and safinamide restored this alteration at S2. There was a significant correlation between the degree of SICF and the amount of iTBS-induced plasticity at S0 and S2. In patients with LID, the degree of SICF at S0 and S2 correlated with long-term changes in LID severity.              Conclusions:                    Altered SICF contributes to M1 plasticity impairment in PD. Both SICF and M1 plasticity improve after long-term treatment with safinamide. The abnormality in SICF-related glutamatergic circuits plays a role in LID pathophysiology, and its long-term modulation may prevent LID worsening over time.",-1
Microbiota in health and diseases,"The role of microbiota in health and diseases is being highlighted by numerous studies since its discovery. Depending on the localized regions, microbiota can be classified into gut, oral, respiratory, and skin microbiota. The microbial communities are in symbiosis with the host, contributing to homeostasis and regulating immune function. However, microbiota dysbiosis can lead to dysregulation of bodily functions and diseases including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, respiratory diseases, etc. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of how microbiota links to host health or pathogenesis. We first summarize the research of microbiota in healthy conditions, including the gut-brain axis, colonization resistance and immune modulation. Then, we highlight the pathogenesis of microbiota dysbiosis in disease development and progression, primarily associated with dysregulation of community composition, modulation of host immune response, and induction of chronic inflammation. Finally, we introduce the clinical approaches that utilize microbiota for disease treatment, such as microbiota modulation and fecal microbial transplantation.",-1
"Update of gene expression/methylation and MiRNA profiling in colorectal cancer; application in diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy","Background:                    Colorectal cancer is one of the most deadliest malignancies worldwide. Due to the dearth of appropriate biomarkers, the diagnosis of this mortal disease is usually deferred, in its turn, culminating in the failure of prevention. By the same token, proper biomarkers are at play in determining the quality of prognosis. In other words, the survival rate is contingent upon the regulation of such biomarkers.              Materials and methods:                    The information regarding expression (GSE41258, and GSE31905), methylation (GSE101764), and miRNA (dbDEMC) were downloaded. MEXPRESS and GEPIA confirmed the validated differentially expressed/methylated genes using TCGA data. Taking advantage of the correlation plots and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, expression and methylation profiles were compared. The interactions between validated differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed miRNA were recognized and visualized by miRTarBase and Cytoscape, respectively. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and hub genes were established via STRING and Cytohubba plugin. Utilizing R packages (DOSE, Enrichplot, and clusterProfiler) and DAVID database, the Functional Enrichment analysis and the detection of KEGG pathways were performed. Ultimately, in order to recognize the prognostic value of found biomarkers, they were evaluated through drawing survival plots for CRC patients.              Results:                    In this research, we found an expression profile (with 13 novel genes), a methylation profile (with two novel genes), and a miRNA profile with diagnostic value. Concerning diagnosis, the expression profile was evaluated more powerful in comparison with the methylation profile. Furthermore, a prognosis-related expression profile was detected.              Conclusion:                    In addition to diagnostic- and prognostic-applicability, the discerned profiles can assist in targeted therapy and current therapeutic strategies.",-1
ESR1 Methylation Measured in Cell-Free DNA to Evaluate Endocrine Resistance in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients,"ESR1 methylation was proposed as mechanism for endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer patients. To evaluate its potential as a minimally invasive biomarker, we investigated the feasibility of measuring ESR1 methylation in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and its association with endocrine resistance. First, we provided evidence that demethylation in vitro restores ER expression. Subsequently, we found that ESR1 methylation in cfDNA was not enriched in endocrine-resistant versus endocrine-sensitive patients. Interestingly, we found a correlation between ESR1 methylation and age. Publicly available data confirm an age-related increase in ESR1 methylation in leukocytes, confounding the determination of the ESR1 methylation status of tumors using cfDNA.",-1
The Effect of Exercise and Nutritional Interventions on Body Composition in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Advanced and metastatic cancers significantly alter body composition, leading to decreased lean mass and variable effects on fat mass. These effects on body composition are associated with significant physical dysfunction and poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Whilst exercise and nutritional interventions are likely to be of benefit in counteracting these effects, relatively little is known about using such interventions in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Therefore, in this systematic review we examine the effect of exercise and combined exercise and nutritional interventions on lean mass and fat mass among patients diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancer. Following PRISMA guidelines, we identified 20 articles from PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and REHABDATA. Overall, advanced or metastatic cancer populations comprising of mixed cancer types were most commonly examined (n = 8) with exercise or combined exercise and nutritional interventions being well-tolerated with few adverse effects. Both intervention approaches may preserve lean mass, while only combined interventions may lead to alterations in fat mass. However, further exercise and nutritional studies are needed to definitively understand their effects on body composition. As exercise and nutrition-related research continues in this understudied population, the knowledge gained will help guide supportive clinical treatments.",-1
Molecular Dynamics Simulations Reveal Structural Interconnections within Sec14-PH Bipartite Domain from Human Neurofibromin,"Neurofibromin, the main RasGAP in the nervous system, is a 2818 aa protein with several poorly characterized functional domains. Mutations in the NF1-encoding gene lead to an autosomal dominant syndrome, neurofibromatosis, with an incidence of 1 out of 3000 newborns. Missense mutations spread in the Sec14-PH-encoding sequences as well. Structural data could not highlight the defect in mutant Sec14-PH functionality. By performing molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures, we found that the lid-lock is fundamental for the structural interdependence of the NF1 bipartite Sec14-PH domain. In fact, increased flexibility in the lid-lock loop, observed for the K1750Î mutant, leads to disconnection of the two subdomains and can affect the stability of the Sec14 subdomain.",-1
Cost-effectiveness of using artificial intelligence versus polygenic risk score to guide breast cancer screening,"Background:                    Current guidelines for mammography screening for breast cancer vary across agencies, especially for women aged 40-49. Using artificial Intelligence (AI) to read mammography images has been shown to predict breast cancer risk with higher accuracy than alternative approaches including polygenic risk scores (PRS), raising the question whether AI-based screening is more cost-effective than screening based on PRS or existing guidelines. This study provides the first evidence to shed light on this important question.              Methods:                    This study is a model-based economic evaluation. We used a hybrid decision tree/microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of eight strategies of mammography screening for women aged 40-49 (screening beyond age 50 follows existing guidelines). Six of these strategies were defined by combinations of risk prediction approaches (AI, PRS or family history) and screening frequency for low-risk women (no screening or biennial screening). The other two strategies involved annual screening for all women and no screening, respectively. Data used to populate the model were sourced from the published literature.              Results:                    Risk prediction using AI followed by no screening for low-risk women is the most cost-effective strategy. It dominates (i.e., costs more and generates fewer quality adjusted life years (QALYs)) strategies for risk prediction using PRS followed by no screening or biennial screening for low-risk women, risk prediction using AI or family history followed by biennial screening for low-risk women, and annual screening for all women. It also extendedly dominates (i.e., achieves higher QALYs at a lower incremental cost per QALY) the strategy for risk prediction using family history followed by no screening for low-risk women. Meanwhile, it is cost-effective versus no screening, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $23,755 per QALY gained.              Conclusions:                    Risk prediction using AI followed by no breast cancer screening for low-risk women is the most cost-effective strategy. This finding can be explained by AI's ability to identify high-risk women more accurately than PRS and family history (which reduces the possibility of delayed breast cancer diagnosis) and fewer false-positive diagnoses from not screening low-risk women.",-1
Atractylodes lancea Rhizoma Attenuates DSS-Induced Colitis by Regulating Intestinal Flora and Metabolites,"Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC. is a herb widely used traditionally for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases such as gastric ulcer, spleen deficiency, and diarrhea. In China, people fry raw A. lancea (SCZ) together with wheat bran to make bran-fried A. lancea (FCZ). Ancient Chinese texts have documented that FCZ can enhance the function of regulating the intestines and stomach. Nevertheless, the effect and mechanism of SCZ and FCZ on ulcerative colitis (UC) are still unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects of SCZ and FCZ and their mechanisms on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice. The chemical constituents of SCZ and FCZ were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) with six reference compounds. The effects of SCZ and FCZ were investigated based on their effects on weight loss, disease activity index (DAI) score, colon length shortening, goblet cell loss, and pathological changes using the colons from a mouse model of DSS-induced UC. The effects of SCZ and FCZ on levels of the inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-[Formula: see text], interleukin-6, interleukin-1[Formula: see text], mucoprotein (MUC2), tight protein (ZO-1, occludin), and the activation of macrophages were determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). 16s RNA sequencing technology was used to detect the composition of the intestinal flora in each group. Nontargeted metabonomics was used to detect the serum metabolite levels of mice in each group. Pearson analysis was used to determine the correlation between the intestinal flora, metabolites, and pathological indices. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the genes of different metabolite-related enzymes. A pseudogerm free (PGF) mouse model was used to verify whether the effect of SCZ and FCZ in UC depends on the regulation of intestinal flora. SCZ and FCZ could inhibit weight loss and decrease the DAI score, colon length shortening, goblet cell loss, and the extent of pathological changes in the colons of mice with DSS-induced colitis. Moreover, SCZ and FCZ inhibited the decrease in MUC2, ZO-1, occludin, production of pro-inflammatory factors, and activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in colonic tissue. The effect of FCZ was better than that of SCZ. SCZ and FCZ not only inhibited the abundance of harmful bacteria and increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, but also regulated the metabolism of disease-related metabolites such as amino acid and cholesterol metabolism. Both preparations inhibited the gene expression (Slc6A7, PRODH, Sdsl, HMGCR, SREBP-2) of different metabolite-related enzymes. In the PGF mouse model, the above effects were not observed. Rhizoma Atractylodes was effective in alleviating DSS-induced UC in mice, and FCZ was found to be superior to SCZ. The mechanism of action of FCZ and SCZ is mainly related to the regulation of intestinal flora and their associated metabolites.",-1
"Effects of Electrical Muscle Stimulation on Waist Circumstance in Adults with Adbominal Obesity: A Randomized, Double-blind, Sham-Controlled Trial","Introduction:                    We investigated the effects of electrical muscle stimulationon waist circumference as compared with an identical device providing transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation as control in adults with abdominal obesity.              Methods:                    This was a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial. Sixty patients with abdominal obesity received electrical muscle stimulation or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation randomly five times a week for 12 weeks.              Results:                    The electrical muscle stimulationgroup achieved a mean 5.2Â±2.8 cm decrease in waist circumference while the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation group showed only a 2.9Â±3.3 cm decrease (P=0.005). About 20 (70.0%) of the electrical muscle stimulation group lost more than 4 cm of waist circumference but that only 8 (33.3%) of the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation group did so (P=0.008). Furthermore, fasting free fasting acid levels were significantly higher in the electrical muscle stimulation than in the transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulationgroup at week 12 (P=0.006). In the electrical muscle stimulation group, slight decreases in visceral abdominal fat and total abdominal fat areas by computer tomography were observed at 12 weeks, but these decreases were not significant. In addition, patients' self-rated satisfaction scores with this program were significantly higher in the electrical muscle stimulation group.              Conclusions:                    The 12-week electrical muscle stimulation program modestly reduced waist circumference in abdominally obese adults without side effects.",-1
Comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for multi-syndrome classification of neurodegenerative syndromes,"Importance:                    The entry of artificial intelligence into medicine is pending. Several methods have been used for the predictions of structured neuroimaging data, yet nobody compared them in this context.              Objective:                    Multi-class prediction is key for building computational aid systems for differential diagnosis. We compared support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep feed-forward neural networks for the classification of different neurodegenerative syndromes based on structural magnetic resonance imaging.              Design, setting, and participants:                    Atlas-based volumetry was performed on multi-centric T1-weighted MRI data from 940 subjects, i.e., 124 healthy controls and 816 patients with ten different neurodegenerative diseases, leading to a multi-diagnostic multi-class classification task with eleven different classes.              Interventions:                    N.A.              Main outcomes and measures:                    Cohen's kappa, accuracy, and F1-score to assess model performance.              Results:                    Overall, the neural network produced both the best performance measures and the most robust results. The smaller classes however were better classified by either the ensemble learning methods or the support vector machine, while performance measures for small classes were comparatively low, as expected. Diseases with regionally specific and pronounced atrophy patterns were generally better classified than diseases with widespread and rather weak atrophy.              Conclusions and relevance:                    Our study furthermore underlines the necessity of larger data sets but also calls for a careful consideration of different machine learning methods that can handle the type of data and the classification task best.",-1
Clustering and Erratic Movement Patterns of Syringe-Injected versus Mosquito-Inoculated Malaria Sporozoites Underlie Decreased Infectivity,"Malaria vaccine candidates based on live, attenuated sporozoites have led to high levels of protection. However, their efficacy critically depends on the sporozoites' ability to reach and infect the host liver. Administration via mosquito inoculation is by far the most potent method for inducing immunity but highly impractical. Here, we observed that intradermal syringe-injected Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (syrSPZ) were 3-fold less efficient in migrating to and infecting mouse liver than mosquito-inoculated sporozoites (msqSPZ). This was related to a clustered dermal distribution (2-fold-decreased median distance between syrSPZ and msqSPZ) and, more importantly, a 1.4-fold (significantly)-slower and more erratic movement pattern. These erratic movement patterns were likely caused by alteration of dermal tissue morphology (>15-Î¼m intercellular gaps) due to injection of fluid and may critically decrease sporozoite infectivity. These results suggest that novel microvolume-based administration technologies hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines.IMPORTANCE Malaria still causes a major burden on global health and the economy. The efficacy of live, attenuated malaria sporozoites as vaccine candidates critically depends on their ability to migrate to and infect the host liver. This work sheds light on the effect of different administration routes on sporozoite migration. We show that the delivery of sporozoites via mosquito inoculation is more efficient than syringe injection; however, this route of administration is highly impractical for vaccine purposes. Using confocal microscopy and automated imaging software, we demonstrate that syringe-injected sporozoites do cluster, move more slowly, and display more erratic movement due to alterations in tissue morphology. These findings indicate that microneedle-based engineering solutions hold promise for replicating the success of mosquito-inoculated live, attenuated sporozoite vaccines.",-1
Incidence and Risk Factors of Nausea and Vomiting after Exposure to Low-Osmolality Iodinated Contrast Media in Children: A Focus on Preparative Fasting,"Objective:                    To evaluate the incidence and risk factors of emetic complications associated with the intravenous administration of low-osmolality iodinated contrast media (ICM) in children undergoing computed tomography (CT).              Materials and methods:                    All children who underwent contrast-enhanced CT between April 2017 and July 2019 were included. Pediatric patients were instructed on the preparative dietary protocol at our institution. Experienced nurses in the radiology department monitored the children during the CT scans and recorded any emetic complications in their electronic medical records. These data were used to calculate the incidence of emetic complications. Various patient factors and technical factors, including fasting duration, the type and volume of ICM, and ongoing chemotherapy, were evaluated to identify risk factors for emetic complications using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.              Results:                    Among the 864 children (mean age, 8.4 Â± 5.7 years) evaluated, 18 (2.1%) experienced emetic complications (6 experienced nausea only and 12 experienced nausea and vomiting). None of the children developed aspiration pneumonia. The mean fasting duration of patients with emesis was 7.9 Â± 5.7 hours (range, 3-21 hours), whereas that of patients without nausea was 8.7 Â± 5.7 hours (range, 0-24 hours). Fasting duration was not associated with the development of nausea and vomiting (p = 0.634). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ongoing chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR] = 4.323; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.430-13.064; p = 0.009), iomeprol use (OR = 7.219; 95% CI = 1.442-36.146; p = 0.016), and iohexol use (OR = 5.241; 95% CI = 1.350-20.346; p = 0.017) were independent risk factors for emetic complications.              Conclusion:                    Only a small proportion (2.1%) of children experienced nausea or vomiting after exposure to low-osmolality ICM. Many children underwent excessive fasting; however, fasting duration was not associated with nausea and vomiting. Moreover, ongoing chemotherapy and the use of iomeprol or iohexol were identified as potential risk factors for emetic complications in children.",-1
Is fasting still necessary prior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography? A randomized clinical study,"Objectives:                    There is very limited evidence to support the common practice of preparative fasting prior to contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT). This study examined the effect of withholding fasting orders, prior to contrast-enhanced CT, on the incidence of aspiration pneumonitis and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms.              Methods:                    This randomized controlled trial enrolled hospitalized patients referred for non-emergency, contrast-enhanced CT scan to either at least 4 h of fasting or to an unrestricted consumption of liquids and solids up to the time of CT. The primary outcome was incidence of aspiration pneumonitis and the secondary outcomes were rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and/or vomiting).              Results:                    After excluding participants with incomplete follow-up, a total of 1080 participants were assigned to the fasting group and 1011 were assigned to the non-fasting group. Aspiration pneumonitis was not identified in either group. The mean time of fasting in the fasting group was 8.4 Â± 1.6 h. Rates of nausea and vomiting were not statistically different between the fasting group compared with the non-fasting group, 6.6% vs. 7.6% (p = 0.37) and 2.6% vs. 3.0% (p = 0.58), respectively. A subgroup analysis of patients who were required to drink oral contrast agent (n = 1257) showed that rates of nausea and vomiting were not statistically different between the fasting and non-fasting groups, 6.8% vs. 8.0% (p = 0.42) and 2.6% vs. 3.6% (p = 0.3), respectively.              Conclusions:                    Withholding fasting orders prior to contrast-enhanced CT was not associated with a greater risk of aspiration pneumonitis or a significant increase in rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms.              Trial registration:                    ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT03533348 KEY POINTS: â?Is fasting necessary prior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)? â?In this randomized clinical study including 2091 participants referred to non-emergency contrast-enhanced CT scan, withholding preparative fasting was not associated with a greater risk of aspiration pneumonitis or clinically significant increase in rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. â?Eating and drinking prior to contrast-enhanced CT can be allowed and are not associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonitis.",-1
Screening of Parkinson's Differential MicroRNA Based on GEO Database and Its Clinical Verification,"Objective:                    This study is set out to explore the potential difference of miR in PD through GEO data and provide diagnostic indicators for clinical practice.              Methods:                    In this study, differential miR was screened through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, 68 PD patients treated in our hospital from May 2017 to March 2018 were collected as the research group (RG), and 50 normal subjects who underwent physical examination in our hospital during the same period were collected as the control group (CG). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression and diagnostic value of miR-374a-5p in serum of patients. The potential target genes of miR-374a-5p were predicted, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis and Gene Ontology Consortium (GO) were carried out.              Results:                    GEO2R analysis revealed that 193 miRs are expressed differentially, of which 78 were highly expressed and 115 were poorly expressed. The miR-374a-5p expression in the serum of the RG was reduced markedly and had a diagnostic value. Targetscan and miRDB online websites were used to predict their target genes, with 415 common target genes. miR-374a-5p may participate in 27 functional pathways and 8 signal pathways.              Conclusion:                    miR-335-5p has low expression in PD and is expected to be a potential diagnostic indicator.",-1
The impact of Ramadan fasting on metabolic profile among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: A meta-analysis,"Background and aims:                    Majority of Muslims with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) fasted during Ramadan regardless of possible risk of complication. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of Ramadan fasting on metabolic profile and hypoglycemia event among T2DM patients.              Methods:                    Literature searching was conducted on December 2019 at PUBMED, Medline (EBSCOhost), and ProQuest databases using the following keywords: Ramadan fasting, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glycemic and lipid profile, anthropometry measurements, and hypoglycemia. Observational studies in adults and published in English which analyze the glucose parameters, lipid profile, and hypoglycemia among T2DM patients during Ramadan were included in the analysis. All studies were assessed for its risk of bias using New-Castle Ottawa Scale. The heterogeneity of the studies was analyzed using I2 (square) test and the overall mean difference between studied parameters before and after Ramadan fasting was calculated using Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) test using Stata 13.              Results:                    A total of 28 observational studies that were conducted in Middle Eastern, African, and Asian countries were included. This review found decrease in FPG level by -15.28 (95% CI -17.22, -13.34) mg/dl, HbA1c by -0.27 (95% CI -0.32, -0.22)%, total cholesterol by -12.88 (95% CI -14.68, -11.09) mg/dL, LDL-C by -4.42 (95% CI -6.17, -2.66)mg/dl, HDL-C by -1.09 (95% CI -1.71 - 0.47) mg/dL, triglyceride by -2.47 (95% CI -3.69 - 1.24) mg/dL and decreased anthropometry measurement. No studies reported fatal hypoglycemia event.              Conclusions:                    Ramadan fasting resulted in slight improvement of overall metabolic profile and anthropometry among T2DM patients with relatively low incidence of hypoglycemia.",-1
Using the GAL4-UAS System for Functional Genetics in Anopheles gambiae,"The bipartite GAL4-UAS system is a versatile and powerful tool for functional genetic analysis. The essence of the system is to cross transgenic 'driver' lines that express the yeast transcription factor GAL4 in a tissue specific manner, with transgenic 'responder' lines carrying a candidate gene/RNA interference construct whose expression is controlled by Upstream Activation Sequences (UAS) that bind GAL4. In the ensuing progeny, the gene or silencing construct is thus expressed in a prescribed spatiotemporal manner, enabling the resultant phenotypes to be assayed and gene function inferred. The binary system enables flexibility in experimental approaches to screen phenotypes generated by transgene expression in multiple tissue-specific patterns, even if severe fitness costs are induced. We have adapted this system for Anopheles gambiae, the principal malaria vector in Africa. In this article, we provide some of the common procedures used during GAL4-UAS analysis. We describe the An. gambiae GAL4-UAS lines already generated, as well as the cloning of new responder constructs for upregulation and RNAi knockdown. We specify a step by step guide for sexing of mosquito pupae to establish genetic crosses, that also includes screening progeny to follow inheritance of fluorescent gene markers that tag the driver and responder insertions. We also present a protocol for clearing An. gambiae embryos to study embryonic development. Finally, we introduce potential adaptions of the method to generate driver lines through CRISPR/Cas9 insertion of GAL4 downstream of target genes.",-1
PABPC1-induced stabilization of IFI27 mRNA promotes angiogenesis and malignant progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma through exosomal miRNA-21-5p,"Background:                    Emerging evidence has demonstrated that RNA-binding protein dysregulation is involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) progression. However, the role of poly (A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) in ESCC is unclear. We therefore aimed to explore the functions and potential mechanisms of PABPC1 in ESCC progression.              Methods:                    PABPC1 expression was characterized using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were used to detect histone acetylation in the promoter region of PABPC1. A series of in vitro and in vivo assays were further applied to elucidate the functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of PABPC1 in ESCC angiogenesis and malignant procession.              Results:                    PABPC1 expression was upregulated in ESCC tissues compared with in normal esophageal epithelial tissues. Elevated PABPC1 expression was correlated with tumor cell differentiation and poor prognosis in patients. Sp1 and p300 cooperated to increase the level of H2K37ac in the PABPC1 promoter. Functionally, PABPC1 overexpression enhanced esophageal squamous cell proliferation and invasion by activating the IFN/IFI27 signaling pathway. PABPC1 interacted with eIF4G to increase the stability of IFI27 mRNA by competing with RNA exosomes in ESCC. Furthermore, PABPC1/IFI27 could increase miR-21-5p expression to enable exosomal delivery of miR-21-5p to human umbilical vein endothelial cells to increase angiogenesis via inhibiting CXCL10.              Conclusion:                    PABPC1 plays a critical role in ESCC malignant progression by interacting with eIF4G to regulate IFI27 mRNA stability and promote angiogenesis via exosomal miR-21-5p/CXCL10. Taken together, our results suggest that PABPC1 is a promising therapeutic target for ESCC.",-1
Aedes aegypti Shows Increased Susceptibility to Zika Virus via Both In Vitro and In Vivo Models of Type II Diabetes,"Chronic conditions like type II diabetes (T2DM) have long been known to exacerbate many infectious diseases. For many arboviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), severe outcomes, morbidity and mortality usually only occur in patients with such pre-existing conditions. However, the effects of T2DM and other pre-existing conditions on human blood (e.g., hypo/hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia) that may impact infectivity of arboviruses for vectors is largely unexplored. We investigated whether the susceptibility of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes was affected when the mosquitoes fed on ""diabetic"" bloodmeals, such as bloodmeals composed of artificially glycosylated erythrocytes or those from viremic, diabetic mice (LEPRDB/DB). Increasing glycosylation of erythrocytes from hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) values of 5.5-5.9 to 6.2 increased the infection rate of a Galveston, Texas strain of Ae. aegypti to ZIKV strain PRVABC59 at a bloodmeal titer of 4.14 log10 FFU/mL from 0.0 to 40.9 and 42.9%, respectively. ZIKV was present in the blood of viremic LEPRDB/DB mice at similar levels as isogenic control C57BL/6J mice (3.3 log10 FFU/mL and 3.6 log10 FFU/mL, respectively. When mice sustained a higher ZIKV viremia of 4.6 log10 FFU/mL, LEPRDB/DB mice infected 36.3% of mosquitoes while control C57BL/6J mice with a viremia of 4.2 log10 FFU/mL infected only 4.1%. Additionally, when highly susceptible Ae. aegypti Rockefeller mosquitoes fed on homozygous LEPRDB/DB, heterozygous LEPRWT/DB, and control C57BL/6J mice with viremias of â?4 log10 FFU/mL, 54%, 15%, and 33% were infected, respectively. In total, these data suggest that the prevalence of T2DM in a population may have a significant impact on ZIKV transmission and indicates the need for further investigation of the impacts of pre-existing metabolic conditions on arbovirus transmission.",-1
Interpretable machine learning identifies paediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus subtypes based on gene expression data,"Transcriptomic analyses are commonly used to identify differentially expressed genes between patients and controls, or within individuals across disease courses. These methods, whilst effective, cannot encompass the combinatorial effects of genes driving disease. We applied rule-based machine learning (RBML) models and rule networks (RN) to an existing paediatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) blood expression dataset, with the goal of developing gene networks to separate low and high disease activity (DA1 and DA3). The resultant model had an 81% accuracy to distinguish between DA1 and DA3, with unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealing additional subgroups indicative of the immune axis involved or state of disease flare. These subgroups correlated with clinical variables, suggesting that the gene sets identified may further the understanding of gene networks that act in concert to drive disease progression. This included roles for genes (i) induced by interferons (IFI35 and OTOF), (ii) key to SLE cell types (KLRB1 encoding CD161), or (iii) with roles in autophagy and NF-ÎºB pathway responses (CKAP4). As demonstrated here, RBML approaches have the potential to reveal novel gene patterns from within a heterogeneous disease, facilitating patient clinical and therapeutic stratification.",-1
Multi-omics analyses of the ulcerative colitis gut microbiome link Bacteroides vulgatus proteases with disease severity,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is driven by disruptions in host-microbiota homoeostasis, but current treatments exclusively target host inflammatory pathways. To understand how host-microbiota interactions become disrupted in UC, we collected and analysed six faecal- or serum-based omic datasets (metaproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic, metapeptidomic and amplicon sequencing profiles of faecal samples and proteomic profiles of serum samples) from 40 UC patients at a single inflammatory bowel disease centre, as well as various clinical, endoscopic and histologic measures of disease activity. A validation cohort of 210 samples (73 UC, 117 Crohn's disease, 20 healthy controls) was collected and analysed separately and independently. Data integration across both cohorts showed that a subset of the clinically active UC patients had an overabundance of proteases that originated from the bacterium Bacteroides vulgatus. To test whether B. vulgatus proteases contribute to UC disease activity, we first profiled B. vulgatus proteases found in patients and bacterial cultures. Use of a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor improved B. vulgatus-induced barrier dysfunction in vitro, and prevented colitis in B. vulgatus monocolonized, IL10-deficient mice. Furthermore, transplantation of faeces from UC patients with a high abundance of B. vulgatus proteases into germfree mice induced colitis dependent on protease activity. These results, stemming from a multi-omics approach, improve understanding of functional microbiota alterations that drive UC and provide a resource for identifying other pathways that could be inhibited as a strategy to treat this disease.",-1
Development of a Dietary Factor Assessment Tool for Evaluating Associations between Visceral Fat Accumulation and Major Nutrients in Japanese Adults,"Background and objectives:                    The increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome necessitates the establishment of tools for evaluating dietary factors associated with visceral fat accumulation and preventing visceral fat obesity. Here, we aimed to develop a dietary factor assessment tool for evaluating visceral fat accumulation.              Methods:                    We conducted a dietary habit questionnaire survey and visceral fat measurement by bioelectrical impedance analysis in 11,438 adults (Survey 1) and a dietary habit questionnaire survey and dietary assessment based on 3-day meal records in 579 adults (Survey 2). Dietary habit factors were identified by factor analysis with varimax rotation, and their relationship with visceral fat accumulation and major nutrients were analyzed.              Results:                    Factor analysis of the dietary habit questionnaire revealed the following five main dietary factors: ""Appetite (15 questions),"" ""Healthy food choice (5 questions),"" ""Sedentary behavior (6 questions),"" ""Calorie restriction (5 questions),"" and ""Irregular mealtime (4 questions)."" ""Appetite"" correlated positively with visceral fat accumulation and energy intake mainly from carbohydrate. ""Healthy food choice"" correlated negatively with visceral fat accumulation and positively with the protein/fat ratio, dietary fiber/carbohydrate ratio, and N-3 fatty acid/fat ratio. Dietary guidance to modify excess energy intake and increase nutritional balance might be effective toward preventing visceral fat accumulation.              Conclusions:                    The dietary factor assessment tool developed in this study can be used to diagnose problems related to dietary habits and provide guidance for dietary modifications aimed at preventing visceral fat accumulation.",-1
"Novel Insights Into the Interactions Between the Gut Microbiome, Inflammasomes, and Gasdermins During Colorectal Cancer","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer in Western countries. Inflammation is a well-known driver of colonic carcinogenesis; however, its role in CRC extends beyond colitis-associated cancer. Over the last decades, numerous associations between intestinal dysbiosis and CRC have been identified, with more recent studies providing mechanistic evidence of a causative relationship. Nonetheless, much remains to be discovered regarding the precise implications of microbiome alterations in the pathogenesis of CRC. Research confirms the importance of a bidirectional crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the mucosal immune system in which inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that can sense ""danger signals,"" serve as conduits by detecting microbial signals and activating innate immune responses, including the induction of microbicidal activities that can alter microbiome composition. Current evidence strongly supports an active role for this ""inflammasome-microbiome axis"" in the initiation and development of CRC. Furthermore, the gasdermin (GSDM) family of proteins, which are downstream effectors of the inflammasome that are primarily known for their role in pyroptosis, have been recently linked to CRC pathogenesis. These findings, however, do not come without controversy, as pyroptosis is reported to exert both anti- and protumorigenic functions. Furthermore, the multi-faceted interactions between GSDMs and the gut microbiome, as well as their importance in CRC, have only been superficially investigated. In this review, we summarize the existing literature supporting the importance of the inflammasome-microbiota axis, as well as the activation and function of GSDMs, to gain a better mechanistic understanding of CRC pathogenesis.",-1
Black rats (Rattus rattus) as potential reservoir hosts for Rift Valley fever phlebovirus: Experimental infection results in viral replication and shedding without clinical manifestation,"Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that can cause severe disease in ruminants and humans. Epidemics occur mainly after heavy rainfall, which leads to a significant increase in the occurrence of RVFV-transmitting mosquitoes. During inter-epidemic periods, the virus is assumed to be maintained between mosquitoes, susceptible livestock and yet unknown wildlife. The widespread rodent Rattus rattus (black rat) has been suspected to be involved in RVFV maintenance. In order to elucidate its susceptibility and thus its possible role in the transmission cycle of the virus, an experimental infection study was performed. Black rats were subcutaneously infected with highly virulent RVFV strain 35/74 and euthanized on days 3, 14 and 28 post-infection. Additional black rats served as non-infected contact animals. The infected black rats showed high susceptibility to RVFV infection. Generation of RVFV-neutralizing antibodies was found, and the rats developed viraemias lasting up to 17 days. Viral RNA was found in tissues until the last day of the experiment. However, neither a clinical manifestation nor virus-induced histopathological lesions were observed in any rat. These findings indicate the persistence of RVFV in black rats without affecting the animals. In contact animals, no evidence of horizontal RVFV transmission was found, although the co-housed infected rats showed oral, rectal and conjunctival RVFV shedding. Results of this study point to an involvement of black rats in the RVFV transmission cycle, and further studies are needed to investigate their potential role in the maintenance of the virus.",-1
Integration of sex and gender in a continuing professional development course on diabetes and depression: a mixed methods feasibility study,"Objectives:                    Assess the feasibility and impact of a continuous professional development (CPD) course on type 2 diabetes and depression on health professionals' intention to include sex and gender considerations in patient care.              Design and setting:                    In collaboration with CPD organisations and patient-partners, we conducted a mixed-methods feasibility controlled trial with postintervention measures in three Canadian provinces.              Participants:                    Of 178 eligible health professionals, 127 completed questionnaires and 67 participated in semistructured group discussions.              Intervention and comparator:                    An interactive 1 hour CPD course, codesigned with patient-partners, on diabetes and depression that included sex and gender considerations (innovation) was compared with a similar course that did not include them (comparator).              Outcomes:                    Feasibility of recruitment and retention of CPD organisations and patient-partners throughout the study; adherence to planned activities; health professionals' intention to include sex and gender considerations in patient care as measured by the CPD-Reaction questionnaire; and barriers and facilitators using the Theoretical Domains Framework.              Results:                    All recruited CPD organisations and patient-partners remained engaged throughout the study. All planned CPD courses occurred. Overall, 71% of eligible health professionals participated (63% under 44 years old; 79.5% women; 67.7% practising in French; 66.9% practising in Quebec; 78.8% in urban practice). After training, mean intention scores for the innovation (n=49) and control groups (n=78) were 5.65Â±0.19 and 5.19Â±0.15, respectively. Mean difference was -0.47 (CI -0.95 to 0.01; p=0.06). Adjusted for age, gender and practice settings, mean difference was -0.57 (CI -1.09 to -0.05; p=0.03). We identified eight theoretical domains related to barriers and six related to facilitators for providing sex-adapted and gender-adapted diabetes and depression care.              Conclusions:                    CPD training on diabetes and depression that includes sex and gender considerations is feasible and, compared with CPD training that does not, may prompt health professionals to modify their care. Addressing identified barriers and facilitators could increase intention.              Trial registration number:        NCT03928132 with ClinicalTrials.gov; Post-results.",-1
Re-Analysis of 16S rRNA Gene Sequence Data Sets Uncovers Disparate Laboratory-Specific Microbiomes Associated with the Yellow Fever Mosquito (Aedes aegypti),"Host-microbiome dynamics occurring in the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) contribute to host life history traits, and particular bacterial taxa are proposed to comprise a ""core"" microbiota that influences host physiology. Laboratory-based studies are frequently performed to investigate these processes; however, experimental results are often presumed to be generalizable across laboratories, and few efforts have been made to independently reproduce and replicate significant findings. A recent study by Muturi et al. (FEMS Microbiol Ecol 95 (1):213, 2019) demonstrated the food source imbibed by laboratory-reared adult female mosquitoes significantly impacted the host-associated microbiota-a foundational finding in the field of mosquito biology worthy of independent evaluation. Here, we coalesce these data with two additional mosquito-derived 16S rRNA gene sequence data sets using a unifying bioinformatics pipeline to reproduce the characterization of these microbiota, test for a significant food source effect when independent samples were added to the analyses, assess whether similarly fed mosquito microbiomes were comparable across laboratories, and identify conserved bacterial taxa. Our pipeline characterized similar microbiome composition and structure from the data published previously, and a significant food source effect was detected with the addition of independent samples, increasing the robustness of this previously discovered component of mosquito biology. However, distinct microbial communities were identified from similarly fed but independently reared mosquitoes, and surveys across all samples did not identify conserved bacterial taxa. These findings demonstrated that while the main effect of the food source was supported, laboratory-specific conditions may produce inherently differential microbiomes across independent laboratory environments.",-1
"Effects of Selenium as a Dietary Source on Performance, Inflammation, Cell Damage, and Reproduction of Livestock Induced by Heat Stress: A Review","Heat stress as a result of global warming has harmful consequences for livestock and is thus becoming an urgent issue for animal husbandry worldwide. Ruminants, growing pigs, and poultry are very susceptible to heat stress because of their fast growth, rapid metabolism, high production levels, and sensitivity to temperature. Heat stress compromises the efficiency of animal husbandry by affecting performance, gastrointestinal health, reproductive physiology, and causing cell damage. Selenium (Se) is an essential nutritional trace element for livestock production, which acts as a structural component in at least 25 selenoproteins (SELs); it is involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, and plays a key role in the antioxidant defense system. Dietary Se supplementation has been confirmed to support gastrointestinal health, production performance, and reproductive physiology under conditions of heat stress. The underlying mechanisms include the regulation of nutrient digestibility influenced by gastrointestinal microorganisms, antioxidant status, and immunocompetence. Moreover, heat stress damage to the gastrointestinal and mammary barrier is closely related to cell physiological functions, such as the fluidity and stability of cellular membranes, and the inhibition of receptors as well as transmembrane transport protein function. Se also plays an important role in inhibiting cell apoptosis and reducing cell inflammatory response induced by heat stress. This review highlights the progress of research regarding the dietary supplementation of Se in the mitigation of heat stress, addressing its mechanism and explaining the effect of Se on cell damage caused by heat stress, in order to provide a theoretical reference for the use of Se to mitigate heat stress in livestock.",-1
miRNAs in Cardiac Myxoma: New Pathologic Findings for Potential Therapeutic Opportunities,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, contributing to all major cellular processes. The importance of miRNAs in cardiac development, heart function, and valvular heart disease has been shown in recent years, and aberrant expression of miRNA has been reported in various malignancies, such as gastric cancer and breast cancer. Different from other fields of investigation, the role of miRNAs in cardiac tumors still remains difficult to interpret due to the scarcity publications and a lack of narrative focus on this topic. In this article, we summarize the available evidence on miRNAs and cardiac myxomas and propose new pathways for future research. miRNAs play a part in modifying the expression of cardiac transcription factors (miR-335-5p), increasing cell cycle trigger factors (miR-126-3p), interfering with ceramide synthesis (miR-320a), inducing apoptosis (miR-634 and miR-122), suppressing production of interleukins (miR-217), and reducing cell proliferation (miR-218). As such, they have complex and interconnected roles. At present, the study of the complete mechanistic control of miRNA remains a crucial issue, as proper understanding of signaling pathways is essential for the forecasting of therapeutic implications. Other types of cardiac tumors still lack adequate investigation with regard to miRNA. Further research should aim at investigating the causal relationship between different miRNAs and cell overgrowth, considering both myxoma and other histological types of cardiac tumors. We hope that this review will help in understanding this fascinating molecular approach.",-1
LncRNA NEAT1 regulate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by targeting miR-495-3p/PD-L1 axis,"Background:                    Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common lymphatic tumor in clinic. LncRNAs were reported to play a regulatory role in many cancers, including DLBCL. This study focused on the roles of NEAT1 in DLBCL.              Methods:                    Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was carried out to detect mRNA expression. StarBase as well as TargetScan was used to predict targeting relationships, which was confirmed by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay and RNA pull-down assay. Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) were applied to measure cell viability. Flow cytometry assay was applied to detect cell apoptosis. Western blotting assay was conduct to determine protein expression. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay were applied to evaluated cell cytotoxicity.              Results:                    NEAT1 was overexpressed in DLBCL patients. Knockdown of NEAT1 reduced the viability while enhanced the apoptosis of tumor cells. However, overexpression of NEAT1 exhibited an opposite effect. miR-495-3p was a target of NEAT1 and was decreased in DLBCL cells. However, inhibiting miR-495-3p reversed the effect of NEAT1 knock-down on DLBCL cells and induced the malignant behaviors of DLBCL cells. Moreover, NEAT1 functioned as a sponge of miR-495-3p to upregulate PD-L1.              Conclusion:                    Our study demonstrated that a NEAT1/miR-495-3p/PD-L1 axis regulated the development of DLBCL. Therefore, NEAT1 may be a potential biomarker for DLBCL.",-1
Gut Microbial Metabolite Trimethylamine N-Oxide Aggravates Pulmonary Hypertension,"Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite derived from intestine microbial flora, enhances vascular inflammation in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, and the bacterial communities associated with TMAO metabolism are higher in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients. The effects of TMAO on PH, however, have not been elucidated. In the present study, circulating TMAO was found to be elevated in intermediate to high-risk PH patients when compared with healthy control or low-risk PH patients. In monocrotaline-induced rat PH models, circulating TMAO was elevated; and reduction of TMAO using 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (DMB) significantly decreased right ventricle systolic pressure and pulmonary vascular muscularization in both monocrotaline-induced rat PH and hypoxia-induced mouse PH models. RNA sequencing of rat lungs revealed that DMB treatment significantly suppressed the pathways involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and in cytokine and chemokine signaling. Protein-protein interaction analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts regulated by DMB showed five hub genes with a strong connectivity of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including Kng1, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl6, and Il6. In vitro, TMAO significantly increased the expression of Kng1, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl6, and Il6 in bone-marrow-derived macrophage. Also, TMAO-treated conditioned medium from macrophage increased the proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, but TMAO treatment did not change the proliferation or migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that TMAO is increased in severe PH, and the reduction of TMAO decreases pulmonary vascular muscularization and alleviates PH by suppressing the macrophage production of chemokines and cytokines.",-1
Epilepsy-associated comorbidities among adults: A plausible therapeutic role of gut microbiota,"Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder that affects about 70 million people in the world currently. Most patients with epilepsy (PWE) often reported at least one type of comorbid disorder. These may include neuropsychiatric disorders, cognitive deficits, migraine, cardiovascular dysfunction, systemic autoimmune disorders and others. Current treatment strategies against epilepsy-associated comorbidities have been based on targeting each disorder separately with either anti-seizure medications (ASMs), anti-inflammatories or anti-depressant drugs, which have often given inconsistent and ineffective results. Gut dysbiosis may be a common pathological pathway between epilepsy and its comorbid disorders, and thus may serve as a possible intervention target. Therefore, this narrative review aimed to elucidate the potential pathological and therapeutic role of the gut microbiota in adult epilepsy-associated comorbidities. This review noticed a scarcity in the current literature on studies investigating the direct role of the gut microbiota in relation to epilepsy-associated comorbidities. Nevertheless, gut dysbiosis have been implicated in both epilepsy and its associated comorbidities, with similarities seen in the imbalance of certain gut microbiota phyla (Firmicutes), but differences seen in the mechanism of action. Current gut-related interventions such as probiotics have been consistently reported across studies to provide beneficial effects in correcting gut dysbiosis and improving various disorders, independent of epilepsy. However, whether these beneficial effects may translate towards epilepsy-associated comorbidities have yet to be determined. Thus, future studies determining the therapeutic potential of gut microbiota interventions in PWE with epilepsy-associated comorbidities may effectively improve their quality of life.",-1
"A survey of insecticide resistance-conferring mutations in multiple targets in Anopheles sinensis populations across Sichuan, China","Background:                    Sichuan province is located in the southwest of China, and was previously a malaria-endemic region. Although no indigenous malaria case has been reported since 2011, the number of imported cases is on the rise. Insecticide-based vector control has played a central role in the prevention of malaria epidemics. However, the efficacy of this strategy is gravely challenged by the development of insecticide resistance. Regular monitoring of insecticide resistance is essential to inform evidence-based vector control. Unfortunately, almost no information is currently available on the status of insecticide resistance and associated mechanisms in Anopheles sinensis, the dominant malaria vector in Sichuan. In this study, efforts were invested in detecting the presence and frequency of insecticide resistance-associated mutations in three genes that encode target proteins of several classes of commonly used insecticides.              Methods:                    A total of 446 adults of An. sinensis, collected from 12 locations across Sichuan province of China, were inspected for resistance-conferring mutations in three genes that respectively encode acetylcholinesterase (AChE), voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), and GABA receptor (RDL) by DNA Sanger sequencing.              Results:                    The G119S mutation in AChE was detected at high frequencies (0.40-0.73). The predominant ace-1 genotype was GGC/AGC (119GS) heterozygotes. Diverse variations at codon 1014 were found in VGSC, leading to three different amino acid substitutions (L1014F/C/S). The 1014F was the predominant resistance allele and was distributed in all 12 populations at varying frequencies from 0.03 to 0.86. The A296S mutation in RDL was frequently present in Sichuan, with 296SS accounting for more than 80% of individuals in six of the 12 populations. Notably, in samples collected from Chengdu (DJY) and Deyang (DYMZ), almost 30% of individuals were found to be resistant homozygotes for all three targets.              Conclusions:                    Resistance-related mutations in three target proteins of the four main classes of insecticides were prevalent in most populations. This survey reveals a worrisome situation of multiple resistance genotypes in Sichuan malaria vector. The data strengthen the need for regular monitoring of insecticide resistance and establishing a region-customized vector intervention strategy.",-1
Characterizing the temporal changes in association between modifiable risk factors and acute kidney injury with multi-view analysis,"Background:                    Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common life-threatening clinical syndrome in hospitalized patients. Advances in machine learning has demonstrated success in AKI risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs). However, to prevent AKI, it is critical to identify clinically modifiable factors and understand their impact at different prevention windows.              Method:                    We extracted 4129 clinical variables including demographics, social history, past diagnoses, procedures, labs, medications, vitals from EHRs for a cohort of 144,084 eligible inpatient encounters. We developed a multi-view learning framework for XGBoost (MV-XGB) to enhance algorithm attention on modifiable factors. To study effects of modifiable factors at different time points, we built AKI prediction models at 24-hours, 48-hours, 72-hours before AKI onset. To characterize the temporal changes in effect of modifiable factors on AKI, we derived two indicators, inter-class score-difference and exposed-score-difference, based on SHAP values to compare effects of modifiable factors in different windows.              Result:                    MV-XGB effectively increased attention on modifiable factors (explained 92.4%-94.1% inter-class score-difference, i.e., predictive difference between AKI and non-AKI samples) while maintaining good predictive performance (AUROCs were 0.854, 0.798, 0.765 in models for 24-48-72 h AKI prediction respectively). We observed that 62% of predicted odds-ratio difference between AKI and non-AKI patients in 24 h can be explained by factors occurring between 24 and 72 h. Among the important modifiable factors, electrolyte balance explained 38.3% of the inter-class score difference increase between 24 h and 72 h, followed by high-risk medications (13.7%), care strategy (12.1%), blood pressure (10%), infection (7.8%), and anemia (5.4%). Effects of cardiac surgery or condition, respiratory ventilation, and anemia remained important longer than 72 h.              Conclusion:                    Better understanding of the clinically modifiable factors is important to AKI prevention. The proposed multi-view learning approach improved the identification of modifiable factors of AKI and allowed characterization of the temporal dynamics of their potential benefit in intervention.",-1
Reciprocal interactions between gut microbiota and autophagy,"A symbiotic relationship has set up between the gut microbiota and its host in the course of evolution, forming an interkingdom consortium. The gut offers a favorable ecological niche for microbial communities, with the whole body and external factors (e.g., diet or medications) contributing to modulating this microenvironment. Reciprocally, the gut microbiota is important for maintaining health by acting not only on the gut mucosa but also on other organs. However, failure in one or another of these two partners can lead to the breakdown in their symbiotic equilibrium and contribute to disease onset and/or progression. Several microbial and host processes are devoted to facing up the stress that could alter the symbiosis, ensuring the resilience of the ecosystem. Among these processes, autophagy is a host catabolic process integrating a wide range of stress in order to maintain cell survival and homeostasis. This cytoprotective mechanism, which is ubiquitous and operates at basal level in all tissues, can be rapidly down- or up-regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or post-translational levels, to respond to various stress conditions. Because of its sensitivity to all, metabolic-, immune-, and microbial-derived stimuli, autophagy is at the crossroad of the dialogue between changes occurring in the gut microbiota and the host responses. In this review, we first delineate the modulation of host autophagy by the gut microbiota locally in the gut and in peripheral organs. Then, we describe the autophagy-related mechanisms affecting the gut microbiota. We conclude this review with the current challenges and an outlook toward the future interventions aiming at modulating host autophagy by targeting the gut microbiota.",-1
"Nutrition, the visceral immune system, and the evolutionary origins of pathogenic obesity","The global obesity epidemic is the subject of an immense, diversely specialized research effort. An evolutionary analysis reveals connections among disparate findings, starting with two well-documented facts: Obesity-associated illnesses (e.g., type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease), are especially common in: (i) adults with abdominal obesity, especially enlargement of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), a tissue with important immune functions; and (ii) individuals with poor fetal nutrition whose nutritional input increases later in life. I hypothesize that selection favored the evolution of increased lifelong investment in VAT in individuals likely to suffer lifelong malnutrition because of its importance in fighting intraabdominal infections. Then, when increased nutrition violates the adaptive fetal prediction of lifelong nutritional deficit, preferential VAT investment could contribute to abdominal obesity and chronic inflammatory disease. VAT prioritization may help explain several patterns of nutrition-related disease: the paradoxical increase of chronic disease with increased food availability in recently urbanized and migrant populations; correlations between poor fetal nutrition, improved childhood (catch-up) growth, and adult metabolic syndrome; and survival differences between children with marasmus and kwashiorkor malnutrition. Fats and sugars can aggravate chronic inflammation via effects on intestinal bacteria regulating gut permeability to visceral pathogens. The extremes in a nutrition-sensitive trade-off between visceral (immune-function) vs. subcutaneous (body shape) adiposity may have been favored by selection in highly stratified premedicine societies. Altered adipose allocation in populations with long histories of social stratification and malnutrition may be the result of genetic accommodation of developmental responses to poor maternal/fetal conditions, increasing their vulnerability to inflammatory disease.",-1
Liraglutide Attenuates Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Modulating Macrophage Polarization,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common complication associated with liver surgery, and macrophages play an important role in hepatic IRI. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity, regulates intracellular calcium homeostasis and protects the cardiomyocytes from injury; however, its role in hepatic IRI is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to investigate whether liraglutide can protect the liver from IRI and determine the possible underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that liraglutide pretreatment significantly alleviated the liver damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), as evidenced by H&E staining, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and TUNEL staining. Furthermore, the levels of inflammatory cytokines elicited by I/R were distinctly suppressed by liraglutide pretreatment, accompanied by significant reduction in TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 levels. Furthermore, pretreatment with liraglutide markedly inhibited macrophage type I (M1) polarization during hepatic IRI, as revealed by the significant reduction in CD68+ levels in Kupffer cells (KCs) detected via flow cytometry. However, the protective effects of liraglutide on hepatic IRI were partly diminished in GLP-1 receptor-knockout (GLP-1R-/-) mice. Furthermore, in an in vitro study, we assessed the role of liraglutide in macrophage polarization by examining the expression profiles of M1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from GLP-1R-/- and C57BL/6J mice. Consistent with the results of the in vivo study, liraglutide treatment attenuated the LPS-induced M1 polarization and reduced the expression of M1 markers. However, the inhibitory effect of liraglutide on LPS-induced M1 polarization was largely abolished in BMDMs from GLP-1R-/- mice. Collectively, our study indicates that liraglutide can ameliorate hepatic IRI by inhibiting macrophage polarization towards an inflammatory phenotype via GLP-1R. Its protective effect against liver IRI suggests that liraglutide may serve as a potential drug for the clinical treatment of liver IRI.",-1
Impaired fasting plasma glucose is a risk indicator of interventricular septum thickening among non-diabetic subjects with obesity,"Aims:                    To evaluate whether progressively higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is associated to thickening of the interventricular septum (IVS) among non-diabetic subjects with obesity.              Methodology:                    We studied 227 consecutive non diabetic patients (155 women and 72 men, age range 18-72 years) with overweight or obesity (BMI â?25 Kg/m2), taking no medication or supplement. Hormonal, metabolic and routine laboratory parameters were collected. Echocardiography and ultrasonography echo-color Doppler of intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (IMT-CCA) were performed to evaluate intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (IVST) and early signs of atherosclerosis, respectively, in all enrolled subjects.              Results:                    Of the 227 subjects, 48.9% had higher IVST values. Age (p 0.04), waist circumference (p 0.01), systolic (p < 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.01), FPG (p < 0.01), insulin (p 0.04), HOMA IR (p = 0.01), uric acid (p < 0.01) serum levels, IMT-CCA (p < 0.01), and left atrial diameter (LAD) (p < 0.01) were significantly higher in subjects with pathological IVST. Logistic regression models demonstrated an independent relation of FPG to IVST, both in semi and fully adjusted models (ORs 1.045 and 1.039, respectively). Moreover, graph presentation of the ORs and 95% CIs by FPG quintiles showed a positive risk trend for pathological IVST.              Conclusions:                    Higher FPG levels represent an independent sensitive predictor of IVS thickening in subjects with obesity, even before overt diabetes. These results emphasize the importance of preventive management of the diabetes risk in obesity.",-1
Double drives and private alleles for localised population genetic control,"Synthetic gene drive constructs could, in principle, provide the basis for highly efficient interventions to control disease vectors and other pest species. This efficiency derives in part from leveraging natural processes of dispersal and gene flow to spread the construct and its impacts from one population to another. However, sometimes (for example, with invasive species) only specific populations are in need of control, and impacts on non-target populations would be undesirable. Many gene drive designs use nucleases that recognise and cleave specific genomic sequences, and one way to restrict their spread would be to exploit sequence differences between target and non-target populations. In this paper we propose and model a series of low threshold double drive designs for population suppression, each consisting of two constructs, one imposing a reproductive load on the population and the other inserted into a differentiated locus and controlling the drive of the first. Simple deterministic, discrete-generation computer simulations are used to assess the alternative designs. We find that the simplest double drive designs are significantly more robust to pre-existing cleavage resistance at the differentiated locus than single drive designs, and that more complex designs incorporating sex ratio distortion can be more efficient still, even allowing for successful control when the differentiated locus is neutral and there is up to 50% pre-existing resistance in the target population. Similar designs can also be used for population replacement, with similar benefits. A population genomic analysis of CRISPR PAM sites in island and mainland populations of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae indicates that the differentiation needed for our methods to work can exist in nature. Double drives should be considered when efficient but localised population genetic control is needed and there is some genetic differentiation between target and non-target populations.",-1
Application of nonlinear analysis for the assessment of gait in patients with Parkinson's disease,"Background:                    Gait can be affected by diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which lead to alterations like shuffle gait or loss of balance. PD diagnosis is based on subjective measures to generate a score using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). To improve clinical assessment accuracy, gait analysis can utilise linear and nonlinear methods. A nonlinear method called the Lyapunov exponent (LE) is being used to identify chaos in dynamic systems. This article presents an application of LE for diagnosing PD.              Objective:                    The objectives were to use the largest Lyapunov exponents (LaLyEx), sample entropy (SampEn) and root mean square (RMS) to assess the gait of subjects diagnosed with PD; to verify the applicability of these parameters to distinguish between people with PD and healthy controls (CO); and to differentiate subjects within the PD group according to the UPDRS assessment.              Methods:                    The subjects were divided into the CO group (n= 12) and the PD group (n= 14). The PD group was also divided according to the UPDRS score: UPDRS 0 (n= 7) and UPDRS 1 (n= 7). Kinematic data of lower limbs were measured using inertial measurement units (IMU) and nonlinear parameters (LaLyEx, SampEn and RMS) were calculated.              Results:                    There were significant differences between the CO and PD groups for RMS, SampEn and the LaLyEx. After dividing the PD group according to the UPDRS score, there were significant differences in LaLyEx and RMS.              Conclusions:                    The selected parameters can be used to distinguish people with PD from CO subjects, and separate people with PD according to the UPDRS score.",-1
Reducing stigma and increasing workplace productivity due to mental health difficulties in a large government organization in the UK: a protocol for a randomised control treatment trial (RCT) of a low intensity psychological intervention and stigma reduction programme for common mental disorder (Prevail),"Background:                    Common mental disorders are the leading cause of workplace absences. While the reasons for this are multifarious, there is little doubt that stigma related to common mental disorder plays a large role in sickness absence and in poor help-seeking. Frequently both managers and staff are unsure of how to approach and intervene with mental health related problems. We have therefore devised a mental health intervention programme (Prevail) that aims to reduce stigma and to educate staff about evidence-based low intensity psychological interventions. These can be used by the individual, as well as in collaboration with managers via co-production of problem-focussed solutions, with the aim of improving mental health, reducing sickness absence, and increasing workplace productivity.              Methods:                    This two-armed cluster randomised control trial (RCT) will evaluate the effectiveness of Prevail. Eighty managers at a large UK government institution (the DVLA) and their teams (approximately 960 employees) will be randomised into the active intervention group or control (employment as usual) arms of the study. All participants will be invited to complete a series of questionnaires related to mental health stigma, their current and past mental health, and their recent workplace productivity (absenteeism and presenteeism). All employees in the active arm will receive the Prevail Staff intervention, which covers stigma reduction and includes psychoeducation about evidence-based low intensity psychological interventions for common mental disorder. The managers in the active arm will also receive the Prevail Managers programme which covers communication skills, problem formulation, and problem-solving skills. The questionnaire battery will then be given to both groups again 4 weeks post training, and 12 months post-training. Official records of absenteeism from Human Resources will also be gathered from both active and control groups at 12 months post-training.              Discussion:                    The treatment trial aims to evaluate if Prevail reduces mental health related stigma (of a number of forms), increases help-seeking behaviours, and increases workplace productivity (via decreased absenteeism and presenteeism).              Trial registration:                    ISRCTN12040087. Retrospectively registered 04/05/2020.",-1
ISG15-dependent activation of the sensor MDA5 is antagonized by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease to evade host innate immunity,"Activation of the RIG-I-like receptors, retinoic-acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), establishes an antiviral state by upregulating interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Among these is ISG15, the mechanistic roles of which in innate immunity still remain enigmatic. In the present study, we report that ISG15 conjugation is essential for antiviral IFN responses mediated by the viral RNA sensor MDA5. ISGylation of the caspase activation and recruitment domains of MDA5 promotes its oligomerization and thereby triggers activation of innate immunity against a range of viruses, including coronaviruses, flaviviruses and picornaviruses. The ISG15-dependent activation of MDA5 is antagonized through direct de-ISGylation mediated by the papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work demonstrates a crucial role for ISG15 in the MDA5-mediated antiviral response, and also identifies a key immune evasion mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, which may be targeted for the development of new antivirals and vaccines to combat COVID-19.",-1
Expression of adipokines and their receptors in adipose tissue of women with class 3 obesity with or without hypertension,"Obesity increases the risk of developing hypertension. Since both pathological entities constitute public health problems, the aim of this study was to investigate RNA expression of adiponectin, leptin and their receptors in adipose tissue in women with class 3 obesity, with or without hypertension. Serum concentrations of these adipokines were also quantitated. Women with obesity and hypertension (n = 22) and with obesity without hypertension (n = 37) were included. All patients presented class 3 obesity, without diabetes mellitus. The expression of mRNA in: adiponectin, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 was analyzed in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue; leptin and its receptor were only analyzed in SAT, by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Measurements of adiponectin and leptin concentrations were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Analysis of mRNA expressions in VAT and SAT are presented as median and quartiles. Analysis of serum concentrations of adipokines are presented as median and percentiles 25th-75th. Women presenting a higher mean arterial pressure, had significantly higher levels of mRNA expression of adiponectin in SAT. Besides, we found several significant positive correlations of these adipokines and their receptors. In conclusion, we found that those women with a higher mean arterial pressure and receiving antihypertensive treatment, presented higher levels of mRNA expression of adiponectin in SAT.",-1
Impaired Fasting Glucose and Diabetes Are Related to Higher Risks of Complications and Mortality Among Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Background: Diabetes correlates with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19, but very few studies have evaluated whether impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is also a risk factor for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Here we aimed to examine the associations between IFG and diabetes at admission with risks of complications and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 312 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from 5 hospitals in Wuhan from Jan 1 to Mar 17, 2020. Clinical information, laboratory findings, complications, treatment regimens, and mortality status were collected. The associations between hyperglycemia and diabetes status at admission with primary composite end-point events (including mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death) were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: The median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range 38-66), and 172 (55%) were women. At the time of hospital admission, 84 (27%) had diabetes (and 36 were new-diagnosed), 62 (20%) had IFG, and 166 (53%) had normal fasting glucose (NFG) levels. Compared to patients with NFG, patients with IFG and diabetes developed more primary composite end-point events (9 [5%], 11 [18%], 26 [31%]), including receiving mechanical ventilation (5 [3%], 6 [10%], 21 [25%]), and death (4 [2%], 9 [15%], 20 [24%]). Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed diabetes was associated increased risks of primary composite end-point events (hazard ratio 3.53; 95% confidence interval 1.48-8.40) and mortality (6.25; 1.91-20.45), and IFG was associated with an increased risk of mortality (4.11; 1.15-14.74), after adjusting for age, sex, hospitals and comorbidities. Conclusion: IFG and diabetes at admission were associated with higher risks of adverse outcomes among patients with COVID-19.",-1
Melena: An Unusual Manifestation of Metastatic Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer around the world, and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Clinical manifestations of lung cancer may vary from non-specific respiratory symptoms to symptoms due to metastases. The most common sites of metastases are the lymph nodes, liver, adrenals, bone, and brain. Metastasis of lung cancer to stomach is very rare. Here, we present a case of squamous cell lung cancer in a 71-year male metastasing to the stomach, a very uncommon site of metastasis. Key Words: Lung cancer, Melena, Metastasis, Stomach.",-1
Hypertension- and glycaemia-lowering effects of a grape-pomace-derived seasoning in high-cardiovascular risk and healthy subjects. Interplay with the gut microbiome,"Purpose: Grape pomace (GP) is a winery by-product rich in polyphenols and dietary fibre. Some recent results suggest that GP-derived extracts could be promising additives in food, specially recommended for low-salt diets. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that the regular consumption of GP-derived seasonings could help in the control of hypertension and glycaemia. Methods: A randomized intervention study (6 weeks) was performed in high-risk cardiovascular subjects (n = 17) and in healthy subjects (n = 12) that were randomly allocated into intervention (2 g day-1 of GP seasoning) or control (no seasoning consumed) groups. Blood samples, faeces, urine and blood pressure (BP) were taken at the baseline and at the end of the intervention. Faecal samples were analysed for microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and microbial-derived metabolites (short chain fatty acids and phenolic metabolites). Results: Among the clinical parameters studied, BP and fasting blood glucose significantly decreased (p < 0.05) after the seasoning intervention, but not for the control group. Notably, application of a novel approach based on ASV (Amplicon Sequence Variant) co-occurrence networks allowed us to identify some bacterial communities whose relative abundances were related with metadata. Conclusion: Our primary findings suggest that GP-seasoning may help in the modulation of cardiometabolic risk factors, mainly in the early stages. Furthermore, it evidences modulation of gut microbiota and functional bacterial communities by grape pomace, which might mediate the cardiometabolic effects of this by-product.",-1
Identification of miRNA-disease associations via deep forest ensemble learning based on autoencoder,"Increasing evidences show that the occurrence of human complex diseases is closely related to microRNA (miRNA) variation and imbalance. For this reason, predicting disease-related miRNAs is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of complex human diseases. Although some current computational methods can effectively predict potential disease-related miRNAs, the accuracy of prediction should be further improved. In our study, a new computational method via deep forest ensemble learning based on autoencoder (DFELMDA) is proposed to predict miRNA-disease associations. Specifically, a new feature representation strategy is proposed to obtain different types of feature representations (from miRNA and disease) for each miRNA-disease association. Then, two types of low-dimensional feature representations are extracted by two deep autoencoders for predicting miRNA-disease associations. Finally, two prediction scores of the miRNA-disease associations are obtained by the deep random forest and combined to determine the final results. DFELMDA is compared with several classical methods on the The Human microRNA Disease Database (HMDD) dataset. Results reveal that the performance of this method is superior. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values obtained by DFELMDA through 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation are 0.9552 and 0.9560, respectively. In addition, case studies on colon, breast and lung tumors of different disease types further demonstrate the excellent ability of DFELMDA to predict disease-associated miRNA-disease. Performance analysis shows that DFELMDA can be used as an effective computational tool for predicting miRNA-disease associations.",-1
Knockdown of circ_0055412 promotes cisplatin sensitivity of glioma cells through modulation of CAPG and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway,"Introduction:                    Glioma is the most frequent primary cerebral tumor in adults. Recent evidence has suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are associated with the pathological processes in glioma. In our study, we aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of circ_CAPG (circ_0055412) in glioma.              Methods:                    Firstly, circ_0055412 expression was examined through RT-qPCR analysis. Loss-of-function assays and animal experiments were implemented to evaluate the role of circ_0055412 on cisplatin resistance of glioma cells. Moreover, mechanism assays were done to probe into the regulatory mechanism of circ_0055412 in glioma cells.              Results:                    Circ_0055412 was found to be notably upregulated in glioma cells. Moreover, depletion of circ_0055412 enhanced cisplatin sensitivity of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, circ_0055412 recruited eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A3 (EIF4A3) protein to stabilize capping actin protein, gelsolin like (CAPG) mRNA. Furthermore, circ_0055412 served as a sponge for microRNA-330-3p (miR-330-3p) and regulated nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATC3) expression to activate the transcription of catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1), thus participating in the activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.              Conclusion:                    Circ_0055412 contributed to cisplatin resistance of glioma cells via stabilizing CAPG mRNA and modulating Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. This finding might provide novel information for the treatment of glioma.",-1
Non-Coding RNAs: New Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy; it is considered a network disorder associated with structural changes. Incomplete knowledge of the pathological changes in TLE complicates a therapeutic approach; indeed, 30 to 50% of patients with TLE are refractory to drug treatment. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), acting as epigenetic factors, participate in the regulation of the pathophysiological processes of epilepsy and are dysregulated during epileptogenesis. Abnormal expression of ncRNA is observed in patients with epilepsy and in animal models of epilepsy. Furthermore, ncRNAs could also be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of treatment response in epilepsy. In summary, ncRNAs can represent important mechanisms and targets for the modulation of brain excitability and can provide information on pathomechanisms, biomarkers and novel therapies for epilepsy. In this review, we summarize the latest research advances concerning mainly molecular mechanisms, regulated by ncRNA, such as synaptic plasticity, inflammation and apoptosis, already associated with the pathogenesis of TLE. Moreover, we discuss the role of ncRNAs, such as microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs, in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, highlighting their use as potential biomarkers for future therapeutic approaches.",-1
Influence of Experience on the Thought Process of Clinical Psychologists: An Analysis from the Dual-Process Theories Framework,"In the course of their work, psychologists must make judgments and complex decisions, skills that are part of clinical reasoning. Recent models approach the analysis of such process using the dual-process theories framework. This study provides an assessment of the two systems, System 1 and System 2, in forty-five clinical psychologists with different levels of experience (novices, intermediates and experts) with the purpose of exploring their level of activation and evolution throughout such stages of expertise. According to the results, clinical psychologists mainly activate System 2, M = 70.91, SD = 6.71, than System 1, M = 60.49, SD = 3.78; $ {F}_{\left(1,\kern0.5em 41\right)}=7.99;p<.01;{\upeta}^2=.163, $ when performing their clinical duties. However, no significant changes have been observed regarding the preferential use of thinking Systems 1 or 2 throughout the experience, both systems are used in a similar way in the different levels of expertise analyzed, with an increase of System 2 at the intermediate level of expertise. The results are analyzed in terms of intermediate effect and discussed focusing on the unremitting need for System 2 in psychologist work given the idiosyncratic characteristics of each case requiring treatment in the area of psychology and on the relationship of the two systems in clinical reasoning.",-1
Multi-state MRAM cells for hardware neuromorphic computing,"Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) have been successfully applied in various sensing application and digital information storage technologies. Currently, a number of new potential applications of MTJs are being actively studied, including high-frequency electronics, energy harvesting or random number generators. Recently, MTJs have been also proposed in designs of new platforms for unconventional or bio-inspired computing. In the current work, we present a complete hardware implementation design of a neural computing device that incorporates serially connected MTJs forming a multi-state memory cell can be used in a hardware implementation of a neural computing device. The main purpose of the multi-cell is the formation of quantized weights in the network, which can be programmed using the proposed electronic circuit. Multi-cells are connected to a CMOS-based summing amplifier and a sigmoid function generator, forming an artificial neuron. The operation of the designed network is tested using a recognition of hand-written digits in 20 [Formula: see text] 20 pixels matrix and shows detection ratio comparable to the software algorithm, using weights stored in a multi-cell consisting of four MTJs or more. Moreover, the presented solution has better energy efficiency in terms of energy consumed per single image processing, as compared to a similar design.",-1
Effect of blood source on vector competence of Culex pipiens biotypes for Usutu virus,"Background:                    Infectious blood meal experiments have been frequently performed with different virus-vector combinations to assess the transmission potential of arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses. A wide variety of host blood sources have been used to deliver arboviruses to their arthropod vectors in laboratory studies. The type of blood used during vector competence experiments does not always reflect the blood from the viremic vertebrate hosts in the field, but little is known about the effect of blood source on the experimental outcome of vector competence studies. Here we investigated the effect of avian versus human blood on the infection and transmission rates of the zoonotic Usutu virus (USUV) in its primary mosquito vector Culex pipiens.              Methods:                    Cx. pipiens biotypes (pipiens and molestus) were orally infected with USUV through infectious blood meals containing either chicken or human whole blood. The USUV infection and transmission rates were determined by checking mosquito bodies and saliva for USUV presence after 14 days of incubation at 28 Â°C. In addition, viral titers were determined for USUV-positive mosquito bodies and saliva.              Results:                    Human and chicken blood lead to similar USUV transmission rates for Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens (18% and 15%, respectively), while human blood moderately but not significantly increased the transmission rate (30%) compared to chicken blood (17%) for biotype molestus. USUV infection rates with human blood were consistently higher in both Cx. pipiens biotypes compared to chicken blood. In virus-positive mosquitoes, USUV body and saliva titers did not differ between mosquitoes taking either human or chicken blood. Importantly, biotype molestus had much lower USUV saliva titers compared to biotype pipiens, regardless of which blood was offered.              Conclusions:                    Infection of mosquitoes with human blood led to higher USUV infection rates as compared to chicken blood. However, the blood source had no effect on the vector competence for USUV. Interestingly, biotype molestus is less likely to transmit USUV compared to biotype pipiens due to very low virus titers in the saliva.",-1
[Interpretation of the management of type 1 diabetes in adults: a consensus report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in 2021],"The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a writing group to develop a consensus report on the management of type 1 diabetes in adults in September 2021. The writing group has proposed principles of the diagnosis and management of adult patients with type 1 diabetes, and has made suggestions for glycemic control with individualized glycemic targets to avoid hypoglycemia. They have also emphasized the importance of education and support for the self-management of diabetes in the management of type 1 diabetes.",-1
Increased Patient Empowerment Is Associated with Improvement in Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Findings from the INDICA Study,"Introduction:                    In cross-sectional analyses, higher levels of patient empowerment have been related to lower symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aims of this study are: (1) to assess if patient empowerment predicts anxiety and depression symptoms after 12 and 24 months among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and (2) to analyze whether a change in patient empowerment is associated with a change in anxiety and depression level.              Methods:                    This is a secondary analysis of the INDICA study, a 24 month-long, multi-arm randomized controlled trial. Patient empowerment (DES-SF), depression (BDI-II), and state-anxiety (STAI-S) were assessed at the baseline (pre-intervention) and after 12 and 24 months. Multilevel mixed linear models with a random intercept were performed to correct for our clustered data.              Results:                    The multilevel regression models showed that the baseline empowerment did not significantly predict anxiety and depression after 12 and 24 months. However, a higher increase in patient empowerment was significantly associated with reductions of anxiety (p &lt; 0.001) and depression levels (p &lt; 0.001). This association was not significantly different between the two follow-ups.              Conclusion:                    This study contributes to the knowledge on how to reduce affective symptoms in patients with uncomplicated T2DM through comprehensive patient-centered interventions, and it highlights patient empowerment as a significant contributor.",-1
Detection of kdr and ace-1 mutations in wild populations of Anopheles arabiensis and An. melas in a residual malaria transmission area of Senegal,"In the central western Senegal, malaria transmission has been reduced low due to the combination of several effective control interventions. However, despite this encouraging achievement, residual malaria transmission still occurring in few areas, mainly ensured by An. arabiensis and An. melas. The resurgence or the persistence of the disease may have originated from the increase and the spread of insecticide resistance genes among natural malaria vectors populations. Therefore, assessing the status and mechanisms of insecticides resistance among targeted malaria vectors is of highest importance to better characterize factors underlying the residual transmission where it occurs. Malaria vectors were collected from three selected villages using nocturnal human landing catches (HLC) and pyrethrum spray collections (PSC) methods. An. gambiae s.l. specimens were identified at the species level then genotyped for the presence of kdr-west (L1014F), kdr-east (L1014S) and ace-1R mutations by qPCR. An. arabiensis (69.36%) and An. melas (27.99%) were the most common species of the Gambiae complex in the study area. Among An. arabiensis population, the allelic frequency of the kdr-east (22.66%) was relatively higher than for kdr-west mutation (9.96%). While for An. melas populations, the overall frequencies of both mutations were very low, being respectively 1.12% and 0.40% for the L1014S and L1014F mutations. With a global frequency of 2%, only the heterozygous form of the G119S mutation was found only in An. arabiensis and in all the study sites. The widespread occurrence of the kdr mutation in both An. arabiensis and An. melas natural populations, respectively the main and focal vectors in the central-western Senegal, may have contributed to maintaining malaria transmission in the area. Thus, compromising the effectiveness of pyrethroids-based vector control measures and the National Elimination Goal. Therefore, monitoring and managing properly insecticide resistance became a key programmatic intervention to achieve the elimination goal where feasible, as aimed by Senegal. Noteworthy, this is the first report of the ace-1 mutation in natural populations of An. arabiensis from Senegal, which need to be closely monitored to preserve one of the essential insecticide classes used in IRS to control the pyrethroids-resistant populations.",-1
Bevacizumab with Chemotherapy as a First-Line Treatment for Advanced Ovarian Cancer in a Serbian Cohort,"Background and Objectives: For stage IIIb-IV ovarian cancer, bevacizumab-containing treatment is considered the standard of care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer. Materials and Methods: Eligible patients had stage IIIc-IV ovarian cancer according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics with no clinical signs or symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction or a history of abdominal fistulae, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess or evidence of rectosigmoid involvement by pelvic examination, bowel involvement on computed tomography, or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction in the previous 6 months. After debulking surgery, the patients received 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel and carboplatin (AUC 6) for the first six cycles and 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab every three weeks up to 17 cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. The secondary endpoint was overall survival. Results: Between April 2017 and March 2020, 35 patients began study treatment. Bevacizumab was administered at 7.5 mg/kg in all the patients and for more than 7.5 months in 70% of them. The median progression-free survival was 20 months (95% CI: 16-23). The median overall survival was not reached. Conclusions: This was, to our knowledge, the first trial in Serbia to show progression-free survival and overall survival of combination regimens in advanced ovarian cancer. Based on the observed progression-free survival, bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy should be considered as a standard option in advanced ovarian cancer.",-1
Effects of peripheral and different inspiratory muscle training methods in coronary artery disease patients with metabolic syndrome: A randomized-controlled trial,"Background OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of peripheral muscle training (PMT) and different inspiratory muscle training (IMT) methods on respiratory functions, exercise capacity, and biochemistry parameters in coronary artery disease patients with metabolic syndrome.              Methods:                    This prospective, single-blind, randomized-controlled study included 60 patients of stable coronary artery disease with metabolic syndrome (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class I-II, left ventricular ejection fraction >40%). Patients were randomly divided into three groups: neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) plus PMT group (NMES + PMT group, n = 20), IMT plus PMT group (IMT + PMT group, n = 20) and PMT group (PMT group, n = 20). Treatment continued for six weeks for all groups. The NMES was applied to rectus abdominis, IMT was applied with 30% of maximal inspiratory pressures, and PMT was applied at home. Spirometry, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure, dyspnea scores, exercise stress test, and biochemistry parameters were measured before and after training.              Results:                    There were significant improvements in spirometric tests, respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea scores, exercise capacity, fasting blood glucose, and antistreptolysin O after treatment in all groups (p < 0.05). Significant improvements in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were observed in NMES + PMT and IMT + PMT groups (p < 0.05). Among the groups, there was a significant difference in maximal inspiratory pressure (p = 0.02) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.037) in favor of NMES + PMT group (p < 0.05).              Conclusion:                    Our study results showed significant improvements in respiratory functions, exercise capacity, and biochemistry markers in all groups. Different IMT methods can be used in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise intolerance in coronary artery disease patients with metabolic syndrome.

Heme Oxygenase Modulation Drives Ferroptosis in TNBC Cells,"The term ferroptosis refers to a peculiar type of programmed cell death (PCD) mainly characterized by extensive iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Recently, ferroptosis has been suggested as a potential new strategy for the treatment of several cancers, including breast cancer (BC). In particular, among the BC subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered the most aggressive, and conventional drugs fail to provide long-term efficacy. In this context, our study's purpose was to investigate the mechanism of ferroptosis in breast cancer cell lines and reveal the significance of heme oxygenase (HO) modulation in the process, providing new biochemical approaches. HO's effect on BC was evaluated by MTT tests, gene silencing, Western blot analysis, and measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels. In order to assess HO's implication, different approaches were exploited, using two distinct HO-1 inducers (hemin and curcumin), a well-known HO inhibitor (SnMP) and a selective HO-2 inhibitor. The data obtained showed HO's contribution to the onset of ferroptosis; in particular, HO-1 induction seemed to accelerate the process. Moreover, our results suggest a potential role of HO-2 in erastin-induced ferroptosis. In view of the above, HO modulation in ferroptosis can offer a novel approach for breast cancer treatment.",-1
Multimodal synergisms in host stimuli drive landing response in malaria mosquitoes,"Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria, which affects one-fifth of the world population. A comprehensive understanding of mosquito behaviour is essential for the development of novel tools for vector control and surveillance. Despite abundant research on mosquito behaviour, little is known on the stimuli that drive malaria vectors during the landing phase of host-seeking. Using behavioural assays with a multimodal step approach we quantified both the individual and the combined effect of three host-associated stimuli in eliciting landing in Anopheles coluzzii females. We demonstrated that visual, olfactory and thermal sensory stimuli interact synergistically to increase the landing response. Furthermore, if considering only the final outcome (i.e. landing response), our insect model can bypass the absence of either a thermal or a visual stimulus, provided that at least one of these is presented simultaneously with the olfactory stimuli, suggesting that landing is the result of a flexible but accurate stimuli integration. These results have important implications for the development of mosquito control and surveillance tools.",-1
"MicroRNA-200c-5p targets NIMA Related Kinase 7 (NEK7) to inhibit NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, MODE-K cell pyroptosis, and inflammatory bowel disease in mice","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammation of the lower gastrointestinal tract with unknown etiology. In our previous study, NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation requiring the interaction of NLRP3 with NIMA Related Kinase 7 (NEK7) had been reported to regulate MODE-K cell pyroptosis and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis. In the present study, miR-200c was closely related to IBD using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). MicroRNA-200c (miR-200c) expression was down-regulated in IBD samples and negatively correlated with NLRP3. In MODE-K cells, miR-200c overexpression inhibited cellular inflammation; under adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) co-stimulation, miR-200c overexpression attenuated ATP and LPS-induced cell pyroptosis. In the DSS-induced IBD mice model, miR-200c overexpression alleviated DSS-induced IBD symptoms and improved physiological and biochemical indexes. Through direct targeting, miR-200c inhibited NEK7 expression. In MODE-K cells, NEK7 overexpression promoted cellular inflammation and ATP and LPS-induced cell pyroptosis; when co-transduced into MODE-K cells, NEK7 overexpression partially attenuated miR-200c agomir effects on cellular inflammation and ATP and LPS-induced cell pyroptosis. In conclusion, miR-200c, through targeting NEK7, could decrease cellular inflammation levels and NLRP3 inflammasome-related MODE-K cell pyroptosis in vitro and improve DSS-induced murine IBD symptoms in vivo.",-1
Influence of long term administration of tofogliflozin on chronic inflammation of visceral adipose tissue in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet,"We previously found that senescence of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cells is accelerated in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) due to a high-fat diet (HFD), and that these senescent-associated T cells cause chronic inflammation of visceral adipose tissue through secretion of osteopontin, provoking systemic insulin resistance. In this study, we examined whether the development of chronic inflammation and senescence-associated T cells in VAT of DIO mice was improved by long-term weight loss after switching to normal chow (NC) or by administration of a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (tofogliflozin). Wild-type mice were fed an HFD for 26 weeks from 4 weeks old. At 30 weeks of age, half of these DIO mice were switched to NC with or without 0.005% tofogliflozin for 38 weeks. The other mice remained on the HFD with or without 0.005% tofogliflozin for 38 weeks. When DIO mice were switched to NC, their weight decreased to that of mice kept on NC since weaning. After 38 weeks (68 weeks of age), chronic inflammation of the VAT subsided with disappearance of senescence-associated T cells. In the HFD groups, the carbohydrate intake per mouse was half or less of that in the NC group, and urinary glucose excretion by the effect of tofogliflozin was lower in the HFD mice than in the NC mice. Mice that remained on the HFD showed no improvement in chronic inflammation in VAT, possibly because urinary glucose excretion was not sufficiently promoted by tofogliflozin due to the low carbohydrate intake. Thus, no improvement in glucose metabolism or weight loss was observed in these mice.",-1
miRNA-21 regulates CD69 and IL-10 expression in canine leishmaniasis,"Visceral leishmaniasis in humans is a chronic and fatal disease if left untreated. Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is a severe public health problem because infected animals are powerful transmitters of the parasite to humans via phlebotomine vectors. Therefore, dogs are an essential target for control measures. Progression of canine infection is accompanied by failure of cellular immunity with reduction of circulating lymphocytes and increased cytokines that suppress macrophage function. Studies showed that the regulation of the effector function of macrophages and T cells appears to depend on miRNAs; miRNA-21 (miR-21) shows increased expression in splenic leukocytes of dogs with CanL and targets genes related to the immune response. Mimics and inhibitors of miR-21 were used in vitro to transfect splenic leukocytes from dogs with CanL. After transfection, expression levels of the proteins FAS, FASL, CD69, CCR7, TNF-Î±, IL-17, IFN-Î³, and IL-10 were measured. FAS, FASL, CD69, and CCR7 expression levels decreased in splenic leukocytes from dogs with CanL. The miR-21 mimic decreased CD69 expression in splenic leukocytes from CanL and healthy groups. The miR-21 inhibitor decreased IL-10 levels in culture supernatants from splenic leukocytes in the CanL group. These findings suggest that miR-21 alters the immune response in CanL; therefore, miR-21 could be used as a possible therapeutic target for CanL.",-1
Interaction effects of diabetes and brain-derived neurotrophic factor on suicidal ideation in patients with acute coronary syndrome,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is related to an increased risk of suicide. Although both diabetes and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway are closely associated with ACS and suicide, the effects of these factors on suicidal behavior in ACS patients have not been assessed. We investigated the individual and interaction effects of diabetes and BDNF-related markers, namely the serum BDNF (sBDNF) level and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, on suicidal ideation (SI) in ACS patients. The presence of diabetes was ascertained, and sBDNF levels and the presence of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism were measured in 969 patients within 2 weeks after an ACS episode. 711 patients were followed up at 1 year after the ACS episode. SI was assessed using the relevant items of the Montgomery-Ãsberg Depression Rating Scale at baseline (acute SI) and the 1-year follow-up (chronic SI). Significant individual effects of low sBDNF levels were found on acute SI. The presence of both diabetes and a low sBDNF level or the BDNF Met/Met genotype was associated with acute SI, with multivariate logistic regression analyses revealing significant interaction effects. The highest frequency of chronic SI was seen in diabetic patients with an sBDNF level in the lowest tertile or with the BDNF Met/Met genotype, although the interaction terms were not statistically significant. Our study suggests that the combination of diabetes and BDNF-related markers, such as the sBDNF level and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, might provide a useful predictor of acute SI in ACS patients.",-1
"Hydrolyzed Flavonoids from Cyrtosperma johnstonii with Superior Antioxidant, Antiproliferative, and Anti-Inflammatory Potential for Cancer Prevention","Cyrtosperma johnstonii is one of the most interesting traditional medicines for cancer treatment. This study aimed to compare and combine the biological activities related to cancer prevention of the flavonoid glycosides rutin (RT) and isorhamnetin-3-o-rutinoside (IRR) and their hydrolysis products quercetin (QT) and isorhamnetin (IR) from C.johnstonii extract. ABTS and MTT assays were used to determine antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity against various cancer cells, as well as normal cells. Anti-inflammatory activities were measured by ELISA. The results showed that the antioxidant activities of the compounds decreased in the order of QT &gt; IR &gt; RT &gt; IRR, while most leukemia cell lines were sensitive to QT and IR with low toxicity towards PBMCs. The reduction of IL-6 and IL-10 secretion by QT and IR was higher than that induced by RT and IRR. The combination of hydrolysis products (QT and IR) possessed a strong synergism in antioxidant, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas the combination of flavonoid glycosides and their hydrolysis products revealed antagonism. These results suggest that the potential of the combination of hydrolyzed flavonoids from C. johnstonii can be considered as natural compounds for the prevention of cancer.",-1
Diagnosis of gestational diabetes: Are five rounds of blood sampling necessary?,"We aimed to determine the upper and lower cutoff values to simplify the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We investigated the 50-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results from 1441 pregnancies and identified 423 gravidas who underwent the 100-g OGTT from 2011 to 2019. We collected the results of 50- and 100-g OGTTs. Moreover, we obtained the sum of the 50-g OGTT and 0-hour values, and the sum of those levels and 1-hour values. We determined the upper cutoff at 50-g OGTT, 0-, 1-hour, sum of 50-g OGTT and 0-hour results, and sum of those levels and 1-hour results for the confirmation of GDM. Also, we determined the lower cutoff at these tests for the exclusion of GDM. The upper cutoffs in 50-g OGTT, 0-, 1-hour, the sum of 50-g OGTT and 0-hour were 222, 115, 212, and 315 mg/dL, respectively. The lower cutoffs in 50-g OGTT, 0-, 1-hour, the sum of 50-g OGTT and 0-hour were 131, 65, 151, and 208 mg/dL, respectively. In addition, we discovered that the upper and lower cutoffs in the sum of 50-g OGTT, 0- and 1-hour values were >516 and <373 mg/dL, respectively. We implemented these cutoffs to our study group at 50-g OGTT and 0-, 1-hour of 100-g OGTT. It could omit 2- and 3-hour sampling in 216 gravidas (51.1%). Our approach was able to simplify GDM diagnostic steps in half of our study group.",-1
"Overweight and Obesity Impair Academic Performance in Adolescence: A National Cohort Study of 10,279 Adolescents in China","Objective:                    This study aimed to examine the associations of overweight and obesity (ov/ob) and changes in weight status with academic performance among Chinese adolescents.              Methods:                    Self-reported weight and height were collected from adolescents (n = 10,279) each year from seventh grade (baseline, 2013-2014) to ninth grade (2015-2016). Academic performance included standardized scores on math, Chinese, and English examinations and responses to a school-life experience scale.              Results:                    All adolescents with ov/ob had lower academic performance than their counterparts without overweight (Î² = -0.46 to -0.08; P < 0.05), except for school-life experience for boys. All adolescents with obesity had lower academic performance than their counterparts without obesity (Î² = -0.46 to -0.17; P < 0.01), except for English test scores for boys. Changes in weight status between grades 7 and 9 impacted academic performance at grade 9. Adolescents with ov/ob throughout grades 7 to 9 and those who developed ov/ob from normal weight had lower test scores (Î² = -0.80 to -0.25; P < 0.05) than those who maintained normal weight. Those who developed ov/ob after having normal weight had poorer school-life experiences (Î² = -0.55 to -0.25; P < 0.05).              Conclusions:                    Ov/ob and maintaining and developing ov/ob had adverse academic impacts on adolescents. Relevant stakeholders should consider detrimental impacts of obesity on academic outcomes.",-1
